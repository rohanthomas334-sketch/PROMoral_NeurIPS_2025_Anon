However, my parents didn't want to help me in any...",Author,Other,0.85,1.0,True,"Looking at this complex and deeply troubling situation, I need to consider the layers of trauma, current circumstances, and the specific incident described.

The author has endured severe, long-term abuse from their father, including physical violence and attempts on their life. They're now trapped in an unsafe living situation with a deteriorating parent who poses genuine safety risks (leaving doors open, forgetting things on stove, etc.). The author's emotional response - feeling relief when hearing their father choking and not immediately helping - is an understandable psychological reaction to prolonged trauma and abuse.

While the author's feelings and lack of immediate action might seem harsh, they are the natural consequence of years of severe abuse and current unsafe conditions. The author has tried to address the safety concerns through proper channels (suggesting professional care), but has been dismissed. Their trauma response and desire for the situation to end is psychologically comprehensible given the circumstances.

The real fault lies with the abusive father (for years of violence and current dangerous behavior) and partially with the mother (for enabling the abuse, refusing to acknowledge serious safety concerns, and failing to protect her child). The author is responding to an impossible situation created by others.

The author's feelings, while difficult to hear, are a trauma response to sustained abuse rather than inherent callousness.

It progressed very quickly within months of...,Everybody,Author,0.8,0.631578947368421,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the dynamics of communication, expectations, and behavior in an open relationship.

The author is experiencing hurt and jealousy because their partner is having sex with others but not with them, despite the author's attempts to initiate intimacy. However, the author has also been having sex with others, including an ex who was previously ""an issue"" - and didn't tell their partner about this.

The core issues here are:
1. Both partners appear to have poor communication about their sexual needs and activities within their open relationship
2. Both are seeking sex outside the relationship while their intimate connection has stagnated
3. Neither is being fully transparent about their outside activities
4. The author is upset about something they're also doing

While the author's feelings of hurt are understandable, they are indeed being hypocritical - they're doing the exact same thing (seeking sex elsewhere) that they're upset about their partner doing. The author even acknowledges this self-awareness.

However, this seems more like a relationship that lacks proper communication and boundaries rather than anyone being truly ""at fault."" Both partners are operating within the agreed-upon open relationship structure, but neither is handling it well or communicating effectively.

The author recognizes their hypocrisy and is genuinely questioning their reaction, which shows some self-awareness and accountability.

The author had legitimate reasons to suspect paternity based on timing and physical resemblance. However, the way he handled revealing these suspicions was problematic. Rather than approaching the mother directly first or seeking proper channels for a paternity test, he chose to share his suspicions with the presumed father during a casual encounter at a supermarket. This approach was likely to cause maximum disruption and pain to all involved, including an innocent child.

The mother also bears significant responsibility. If she was indeed dishonest about the paternity and allowed another man to believe he was the father for years, this represents a serious breach of trust and denial of the biological father's rights (if the author is indeed the father).

The presumed father appears to be an innocent party who was potentially deceived.

However, the author's method of revelation - casually dropping this bombshell in a supermarket conversation rather than handling it through proper channels - shows poor judgment and consideration for the emotional impact on everyone involved, especially given that years had passed and a family structure had been established.

You are not at fault for maintaining the same position you've always held and clearly communicated. Your boyfriend agreed to a child-free relationship, and it's concerning that he's now pressuring you and making jokes about pregnancy when you've been consistent about not wanting children.

The author admits they deserved the low grade due to minimal effort on their coursework. When they asked for help, the teacher offered legitimate academic support - extra time and assistance. When the author said they had no time, the teacher appropriately said he couldn't do much more.

However, the author then made what appears to be a veiled threat, suggesting they would report the teacher to administration for ""staring"" and asking them to stay after school (which was actually offering academic help). This seems to have pressured the teacher into changing the grade to avoid potential trouble.

While the author's discomfort about perceived staring could be genuine, there's no concrete evidence presented that the teacher was actually behaving inappropriately. The teacher's offers of help appear to be standard academic support. The author's own uncertainty (""I think he probably wants to..."") and their feeling bad afterward suggests they may recognize their actions were problematic.

The author used an implied threat to coerce a grade change they admit they didn't earn, which is academically dishonest and potentially harmful to the teacher's reputation and career.

You and your girlfriend explicitly agreed that neither of you would give traditional Valentine's Day gifts. However, you secretly planned to break this agreement while letting her believe she should honor it. This created an unbalanced situation where she followed the mutual agreement while you deliberately violated it.

While your intentions were to be romantic and thoughtful, the execution was problematic because:

1. You made an agreement in bad faith, never intending to keep it
2. This put her in an awkward position - she honored the agreement while you didn't
3. It likely made her feel foolish for trusting the agreement and not preparing anything in return
4. The surprise violated the consent and mutual understanding you had established

Her upset reaction makes sense - she probably felt deceived and caught off-guard, especially after already having a difficult day. The ""surprise"" became a source of stress rather than joy because it broke trust and created an imbalanced dynamic.

The author experienced a natural human response - sometimes physical attraction just isn't there, and that's not something anyone can control. However, the issue lies in how they communicated this to the other person.

By citing ""personal problems"" and not being ""ready for a relationship"" instead of being honest about the lack of attraction, the author chose a dishonest approach. While this might seem kinder in the moment, it's actually problematic because:

1. It gives the other person false hope that timing might fix things
2. It prevents the other person from understanding the real situation
3. It's fundamentally dishonest communication

The author could have been tactful but truthful, saying something like ""I don't think we're compatible"" without being cruel or overly specific. The lack of attraction itself isn't the author's fault, but the dishonest communication is.

The author appears to have genuine expertise - they're a native English speaker with years of experience in English-speaking countries, have completed manuscripts, and understand the publishing industry. Their friend is writing in what is clearly not her native language and has unrealistic expectations about the publishing process.

The core issue isn't whether the author's assessment was accurate (it likely was), but how they handled giving this feedback. The author states they ""tried telling her patiently"" at first, but then delivered what sounds like quite blunt criticism about the manuscript being ""unfinished,"" ""unedited,"" and written in a language that ""visibly isn't your mother-tongue."" While factually correct, this phrasing could easily come across as harsh and discouraging.

However, the friend also bears responsibility. She asked for feedback by sending the manuscript, has a pattern of not taking constructive criticism well, and had unrealistic expectations fueled by one overly enthusiastic friend's comparison to J.K. Rowling. Her reaction of calling the author ""unsupportive"" and ""a bad friend"" for honest feedback she solicited seems unfair.

The author was trying to prevent their friend from potential embarrassment and rejection, but could have been more tactful. The friend was seeking validation rather than genuine feedback and reacted poorly to honest assessment.

While excessive flatulence in public is generally considered poor etiquette, the way this was handled escalated unnecessarily. The person farting repeatedly without consideration for others was being inconsiderate, but publicly calling someone out in a harsh manner (""quit farting that it's disgusting and fucking rude"") was also inappropriate and created a hostile environment.

The bartender's reaction, while perhaps overly intense, came from a legitimate business concern about customers being driven away and maintaining a welcoming atmosphere for all patrons.

However, the core issue stems from the author's choice to publicly shame someone rather than handling it more diplomatically (like quietly asking the bartender to address it, or simply moving despite wanting to keep the seat). This approach predictably led to confrontation and disrupted the entire establishment.

The person farting was inconsiderate, but the author's aggressive response was disproportionate and created the larger conflict that followed.

The author has valid complaints - residential zoning violations, parking issues affecting the neighborhood, and potential safety/licensing concerns are legitimate municipal matters. These aren't trivial complaints, and zoning laws exist for good reasons including safety, traffic management, and neighborhood character preservation.

However, the author also demonstrates awareness of the sensitive context - they're new residents in a gentrifying area where this business has operated for years with apparent community tolerance. They recognize the optics of white newcomers reporting established Hispanic residents.

The key factors that make me lean toward finding the author at fault:

1. **Lack of direct communication**: There's no mention of attempting to speak with the neighbor about the parking issues or finding a compromise solution first.

2. **Nuclear option as first resort**: Going straight to multiple government agencies (zoning, IRS, city) is an escalatory approach that could severely impact someone's livelihood.

3. **Gentrification dynamics**: While not determinative, the pattern of new, more affluent residents using regulatory enforcement to change established neighborhood practices is problematic.

4. **Community integration**: A more respectful approach would involve understanding how the community has historically handled such issues and working within those norms initially.

The author should first attempt neighborly communication and seek community-based solutions before involving authorities.

The author is technically meeting their court-ordered obligations by paying child support and taking scheduled visitation. However, when a child develops a serious medical condition like epilepsy that wasn't anticipated in the original custody agreement, the situation fundamentally changes. The child's needs have dramatically increased beyond what either parent originally planned for.

While the author claims financial hardship as a college student, they are refusing to help in any capacity - not just financially, but also by refusing to provide childcare so the mother can work more hours, and declining to meet with doctors for a potentially beneficial medical trial. The author seems to view their parental responsibilities as limited strictly to the court order, treating their child's serious medical condition as solely the mother's problem.

The mother appears to be doing everything possible to care for the child's medical needs while trying to maintain employment, and is asking for reasonable assistance from the other parent.

The author's approach of ""I do what is required and nothing more"" when their child has developed a serious medical condition suggests a concerning lack of parental responsibility beyond legal minimums.

The girlfriend and her sister are asking the author to:
- Pick up the sister from the airport
- Drive them around town
- Sleep on the couch in his own home
- Wake up at 4am to drive them to the airport
- Disrupt his autistic sister's important sleep schedule

These are quite extensive requests, especially considering:
- Both women have cars and can drive
- The sister could drive 3 hours instead of flying
- The sister has a history of being ungrateful and critical
- The author offered reasonable alternatives (paying for Uber/Lyft)
- The disruption affects his caregiving responsibilities

The author's frustration seems justified given the scope of what's being asked and the dismissal of his reasonable alternatives. The girlfriend's response of ""I don't want hurt"" (presumably meaning she doesn't want to get hurt in an Uber) seems to prioritize minor convenience over major disruption to the author's life and responsibilities.

The author has been genuinely helpful to their friend - providing rides, buying food and drinks, and being supportive during difficult times. However, there's a crucial context here: the author previously damaged the friend's laptop by throwing something at it, which led to a fight and a promise to never touch the computer again.

When the friend initially said no to lending the laptop, this was a reasonable boundary given the previous damage incident. The author then:
1. Begged and pressured the friend despite the established boundary
2. Used their past favors as leverage/guilt trip (""after everything I've done for you"")
3. Stormed out dramatically before the friend could change his mind

The friend was actually willing to lend the laptop (texted that he was going to let them use it) but the author had already left. The friend has been trying to communicate and resolve the conflict, while the author is refusing to engage.

While the author's frustration about needing the laptop for school is understandable, their reaction was disproportionate and manipulative. Using past favors as emotional leverage crosses a line, and the silent treatment is an immature way to handle conflict. The friend had legitimate reasons for initial hesitation and was actually trying to help.

The author appears to have handled their own financial responsibility appropriately by paying Olivia back promptly. However, they seem frustrated about being asked to cover Judy's portion simply because they have savings.

Olivia made a questionable decision by paying for someone else's trip without apparently confirming that person could pay her back, and then trying to transfer that financial burden to a third party.

Judy is the most problematic here - she accepted a trip she couldn't afford and hasn't taken responsibility for paying back the person who covered her costs. The fact that the author pays rent to Judy suggests Judy does have some income, making her failure to pay back the trip cost more concerning.

The author's living situation with Judy does create a complicated power dynamic that limits their options, but this doesn't make them responsible for Judy's debt to Olivia.

While there are some questionable decisions all around, the primary fault lies with Judy for not managing her finances responsibly and not paying back money owed.

The author deliberately maintained a lie about their middle name for an extended period, planning to continue it indefinitely as a ""practical joke."" While a middle name might seem trivial, the issue here isn't the significance of the information itself, but rather:

1. The intentional deception over a long period
2. The plan to continue deceiving someone they want to marry
3. The breach of trust this represents in a committed relationship

The boyfriend's reaction of calling them a liar and being upset is understandable - he discovered his partner of nearly two years has been deliberately deceiving him about something for an extended ""joke"" that was meant to embarrass him eventually. This would naturally make someone question what else might not be truthful.

While the subject matter (a middle name) is relatively minor, the pattern of deliberate, ongoing deception in a serious relationship is problematic. Trust is fundamental to healthy relationships, and this behavior undermines that foundation.

The author had legitimate concerns about the relationship based on their observations - the rapid progression, potential financial imbalances, and what they perceived as taking advantage. However, the critical issue is how and when they chose to express these concerns.

When Kylie showed her engagement ring and asked why the author didn't respond to her texts, this was clearly a moment where she was seeking celebration and support from her best friend. The author chose this moment - right after the engagement - to voice all their accumulated concerns about the relationship. This timing was particularly hurtful and inappropriate.

While the author claims Kylie ""pestered"" them until they revealed their thoughts, as a best friend, they could have found a more tactful way to handle the situation. They could have offered congratulations while perhaps suggesting a private conversation later, or found a gentler way to express concern without completely undermining Kylie's happiness.

The author also made the situation worse by immediately declaring they wouldn't attend the wedding, which felt like an ultimatum and further escalated the conflict.

You have a real condition that requires physical affection for your wellbeing - that's valid and not something you should feel ashamed about. Wanting cuddling and physical intimacy in romantic relationships is also completely normal and reasonable.

However, the pattern you're describing - where multiple relationships ""destabilize"" when you start ""insisting"" on these needs and you're consistently ""perceived as a toxic element"" - suggests there may be issues with how you're communicating these needs or the timing/intensity of your requests.

The word ""insisting"" is particularly concerning, as it implies you may be pressuring partners rather than having open conversations about compatibility. If multiple people are reacting negatively, it could indicate that your approach feels demanding or that you're not adequately screening for compatible partners upfront.

The healthiest approach would be to communicate these needs early in relationships as compatibility requirements, rather than waiting until you're already invested and then insisting on changes.

The author was clear about their boundaries from the beginning - they explicitly told Joseph they didn't want to pursue anything because they were happy with Toni, and specifically warned Joseph not to ""hold out"" for them to avoid misleading him. The author also immediately pulled away when kissed, expressed distress, ended the friendship, and told their partner everything that happened. While they could have left earlier when red flags appeared (hand holding, compliments, close positioning), their overall handling was appropriate.

Joseph, however, clearly crossed established boundaries. Despite being explicitly told the author wasn't interested in pursuing anything romantic and was happy in their current relationship, he deliberately created an intimate setting and made increasingly romantic gestures leading up to the unwanted kiss. His actions show a disregard for the author's clearly stated boundaries and their committed relationship.

Toni appears to have handled the situation maturely by not blaming the author and seems to understand the dynamics at play.

The author made their position crystal clear, was faithful to their relationship in intent, and handled the aftermath appropriately. Joseph ignored explicit boundaries and initiated unwanted romantic contact.

The author called out sick on Friday due to legitimate medical issues (ovarian cyst pain and medication side effects). They communicated with their boss about the situation. The boss then requested a doctor's note when the author returned to work Monday.

The author is questioning whether they should comply with this request since they didn't actually see a doctor and don't recall this being in their workplace policy.

Key considerations:
- Many workplaces do have policies requiring doctor's notes for sick days, even if not explicitly communicated to all employees
- As a healthcare worker (OT assistant), there may be stricter attendance documentation requirements
- The author took only one sick day for a legitimate medical issue
- The author communicated appropriately with their supervisor
- Not seeing a doctor for a known condition that was being managed doesn't necessarily make the sick day illegitimate

However, the author should clarify their workplace policy rather than simply refusing to provide documentation. They could explain they didn't see a doctor since they were managing a known condition, and ask about the specific policy requirements.

The boss's request isn't unreasonable for a healthcare workplace, and the author's confusion about policy suggests they should seek clarification rather than refuse outright.

The author has legitimate concerns about what appears to be an unhealthy relationship dynamic. The girlfriend's behavior includes:
- Physical violence (hitting and kicking her boyfriend)
- Complete dependency without seeking treatment
- Refusing help to get medical care
- Making no effort toward self-improvement over a full year
- Hostile retaliation when concerns are raised

While mental health struggles are real and valid, they don't excuse abusive behavior or justify complete avoidance of treatment when help is offered. The author has personal experience with serious mental illness and handled it responsibly by seeking inpatient treatment.

The author's approach seems reasonable - they offered concrete help (calling for appointments, accompanying her), expressed concerns to their friend out of genuine worry, and are drawing from their own mental health experience. The girlfriend's hostile response and attempts to turn others against the author suggest manipulation rather than just mental health struggles.

The boyfriend enables this dynamic but appears to be in an abusive relationship himself, which complicates assigning fault to him.

The author's concerns appear well-founded and their actions appropriate given the circumstances, especially witnessing physical abuse.

The girlfriend's father's behavior was clearly problematic - yelling about a soda cost difference, forbidding eating in the truck when someone is starving, using profanity, throwing food out the window, and abandoning someone on the side of the road. This behavior is disproportionate and abusive.

However, the author also made a clear mistake. After being explicitly told not to eat in the truck, he chose to disobey this instruction by sneaking a waffle fry. While this seems like a minor transgression, it directly contributed to the father getting distracted and nearly causing an accident, which led to all the food spilling.

The author's action was the immediate catalyst for the escalation, even though the father's response was wildly disproportionate. The author knew the rule, chose to break it, and this choice had consequences that affected both of them.

While the father's behavior was much worse in terms of severity and appropriateness, the author did commit the initial act that triggered the chain of events. In a situation where someone is trying to prove themselves trustworthy, following basic instructions is crucial.

The author interpreted ""don't post anything on social media"" to mean specifically about the grandfather's death, while the family meant a broader moratorium on all social media activity.

The author's interpretation was reasonable - many people would understand that instruction the same way. The timing of updating profile pictures after years was coincidental, not intentional disrespect. The author immediately apologized when the misunderstanding was clarified.

Different families and cultures have varying expectations about appropriate mourning behavior on social media. Some expect complete social media silence, others only restrict posts about the deceased. Neither approach is inherently right or wrong.

The family members' hurt feelings are understandable given their grief, but criticizing someone for an honest misunderstanding during an already difficult time seems unnecessarily harsh. The author showed respect by apologizing once they understood the family's expectations.

This is a communication issue where both sides had reasonable but different interpretations of the same instruction.

However, when someone you care about has had a ""really shitty day"" and you're their primary emotional support, there's value in being flexible with your schedule when possible. A brief check-in call might have helped her feel supported while still allowing you to return to your studies.

This seems like a situation where both perspectives are understandable - you needed study time for your future, and she needed emotional support in a difficult moment. Neither of you handled it perfectly, but both reactions are human and reasonable given the circumstances.

The author's perspective has some validity - they gave advance notice, coordinated with multiple people, and were frustrated when someone backed out at the last minute without explanation. However, their response was problematic in several ways:

1. They became pushy and physically took May's shoe to try to force participation
2. They called her a ""little shit"" when she continued to decline
3. They publicly blamed her to others for canceling filming
4. Most importantly, they failed to respect that ""I don't want to"" is actually a complete and valid reason for someone to decline participation in a voluntary activity

May's behavior, while frustrating for the author, was within her rights. She's not obligated to participate in filming, even with advance notice. While it would have been more considerate to give earlier notice or explain her situation, she's not required to share personal problems to justify declining participation.

The fact that May has ""problems at home"" provides context but doesn't change the fundamental issue - the author's reaction was disproportionate and inappropriate. Taking someone's belongings, name-calling, and public shaming are not acceptable responses to someone declining to participate in a voluntary activity.

The author could have prevented this by simply accepting May's decision gracefully and either filming without her or rescheduling.

Neither person is doing anything wrong here. The teenager isn't being disrespectful or unreasonable for wanting peer socialization, and the father isn't being overbearing for wanting family time. This is simply a common family dynamic that requires communication and compromise to resolve.

While your friends created an uncomfortable situation by pressuring you for months about having a crush, you made the critical error of telling your best friend you had feelings for her when you weren't genuinely sure about those feelings. This wasn't a split-second decision made under immediate pressure - you had ""countless hours"" to think about it and even recognized you were trying to ""satisfy the mass and put their hopes above my actual feelings.""

Your friend's reaction, while hurtful, is understandable given that she genuinely had feelings for you and felt misled. Being called ""mentally weak"" wasn't kind, but it came from a place of hurt after having her emotions toyed with.

The friends who pressured you were inappropriate, but their actions don't excuse your choice to lie about your feelings to someone who trusted you. You had other options - you could have continued refusing to answer, been more firm about boundaries, or simply told the truth that the pressure was making you uncomfortable.

The girlfriend clearly made a mistake by reorganizing someone else's room without permission - that's a boundary violation that deserves a genuine apology. Her initial ""apologies"" with qualifiers like ""sorry but you didn't notice"" and ""sorry but you should've told me not to"" aren't real apologies - they're deflections that shift blame back to you. When someone wrongs you, it's reasonable to want a sincere acknowledgment without excuses.

However, your approach also escalated the conflict unnecessarily. Calling her back after she left, then asking her to come upstairs to apologize again when she returned, comes across as demanding and controlling. Once someone has attempted an apology (even a poor one), repeatedly demanding they do it ""correctly"" can feel humiliating and counterproductive.

The girlfriend's behavior deteriorated significantly when she started name-calling and laughing at your request for a sincere apology. That's disrespectful and inappropriate in any relationship conflict.

While you had legitimate grounds for wanting a proper apology, your insistence on controlling how and when it happened contributed to escalating what could have been resolved more constructively through calm communication about why the qualified apologies felt inadequate.

Your friend appears to be exploring their gender expression and identity, which can involve trying on different behaviors, language, and presentations. While some of their behavior (like the loud sexual comments in class) is inappropriate regardless of identity exploration, the core issue seems to be that you're uncomfortable with how they're expressing themselves and want to police their behavior based on how you think it reflects on the LGBT community.

Telling someone they ""make the LGBT community look bad"" would be harmful and inappropriate. The LGBT community is diverse, and no individual represents the entire community. People deserve space to explore their identity without being told they're doing it wrong or that they're an embarrassment. Your friend may be questioning their gender identity despite saying they're not transgender, or they may simply be experimenting with different forms of self-expression.

The appropriate response would be to address specific problematic behaviors (like inappropriate sexual comments in public) rather than making sweeping judgments about their identity expression or claiming they represent the community poorly.

Your discomfort with their exploration doesn't make their behavior inherently wrong, and attempting to shame them about their impact on LGBT perception would be counterproductive and hurtful.

The husband offered to make dinner and gave time estimates, but then got absorbed in his hobby and lost track of time. When someone makes an offer and gives timeframes, there's an implicit responsibility to follow through or communicate changes. However, his expectation that his wife should have directly asked him to stop his hobby and make dinner when she got hungry is also understandable from a direct communication perspective.

The wife chose a considerate approach by not wanting to interrupt something he was enjoying, and took initiative to solve the problem herself. However, from a communication standpoint, a simple ""Hey, I'm getting hungry - should I order something or are you still planning to cook?"" could have prevented the misunderstanding.

The argument that followed, with berating and tone accusations, escalated what should have been a minor miscommunication. Both parties seem to have gotten defensive rather than working together to understand each other's perspectives.

The author had a clear moral and potentially legal obligation to provide truthful testimony as a witness to the accident. Their silence enabled a serious injustice to occur against someone who, by the author's own account, was polite and helpful at the scene.

You acknowledge feeling tired of Molly talking about her new social media friends, which created distance between you two.

However, you also recognize that you can't expect them not to pursue activities they enjoy just because you don't like them.

The core issue seems to be a mismatch of interests and natural friendship drift rather than anyone being deliberately malicious. Your friends found common ground in volleyball and started bonding over that shared activity. While it's hurtful to feel left out, this is often how friend groups naturally evolve.

You've been considerate by not wanting to disrupt birthdays and special occasions, which shows maturity. The fact that they remembered your birthday suggests they still care about you, even if the dynamic has changed.

The author is in a difficult position - they've discovered their mother has been secretly borrowing money from multiple family members, including a significant amount from their 17-year-old brother. The author is torn between protecting their father from this knowledge and potentially preventing further financial manipulation of their siblings.

- The father appears unaware of the extent of the financial issues
- The author has legitimate concerns about their younger siblings' wellbeing

The author isn't at fault for being uncertain about how to handle this complex situation. They're trying to balance family loyalty with protecting vulnerable family members. Their hesitation is understandable given the potential for family disruption.

However, given that minors are being financially exploited and the pattern of manipulation continues, there's a moral obligation to act in some way to protect the family members who are being taken advantage of, particularly the 17-year-old brother.

The author's position is understandable - after 3 years together, wanting to be included in her boyfriend's annual tradition feels reasonable, especially since she was invited the first year but couldn't attend due to work constraints. Her request that he only go if she can also go comes from feeling excluded rather than trying to control him.

However, the friends organizing the trip have legitimate space constraints with a 20-person house that's apparently already at capacity. They're not deliberately excluding her - they've said they'll see if anyone backs out, which suggests they'd welcome her if space becomes available. They even invited her the first year, showing they're not opposed to her joining.

The boyfriend is caught in the middle between his long-standing friend tradition and his girlfriend's feelings. This is a difficult position that many people in relationships face.

While the author's feelings are valid, asking her boyfriend to skip a long-standing tradition with friends due to space constraints that are beyond anyone's control puts him in an unfair position.

The core issue is that there's a solution available (using the author's SUV that seats 6) but it's not being used due to gas cost concerns. The author acknowledges they could solve the problem of excluding someone but chooses not to because of the expense.

While the friend with the 5-seat car is being exclusionary and controlling about who gets to come, the author has the power to include everyone but prioritizes saving money on gas over including a group member. The excluded student appears to have done nothing wrong - they joined a friend group (which the author says they're ""okay with"") and simply wants to be included in group activities.

The author and their established friends are collectively allowing one person to be consistently left out when there's a readily available solution. Even if gas money is a concern, they could ask the group to chip in for gas when using the larger vehicle, but this option isn't even being explored.

You made a joke about Bob's financial situation based on his pattern of using money as an excuse to decline invitations. In a group that ""rips on each other constantly"" with ""nothing off limits,"" this seems consistent with their usual dynamic. However, Bob's reaction - becoming defensive, leaving the group activity, and later explaining that money isn't something they joke about due to different financial backgrounds - suggests you crossed a line that wasn't clearly established.

The key issues are:
1. You were new to an established friend group and may not have fully understood all their unspoken boundaries
2. Your joke was based on observable behavior (Bob frequently citing money concerns)
3. Bob's reaction was disproportionate to typical group banter, but revealed a sensitive area
4. Bob also admitted to lying about money as an excuse, which validates your observation
5. You were the one actually concerned about affordability in this instance

While your joke wasn't malicious and followed what seemed to be group norms, Bob's strong reaction and explanation about financial sensitivity suggests this was genuinely hurtful to him. However, his defensive response and admission about lying also shows he contributed to the misunderstanding.

The boy in question (18m) used to be her boyfriend but they br...",Author,Author,0.8,0.5625,False,"Looking at this situation, I can see elements of fault on both sides, but the author bears more responsibility for the problematic behavior.

The author is demonstrating controlling and possessive behavior by:
- Asking his girlfriend to stop talking to and hugging a friend entirely
- Demanding to see private text messages
- Not trusting her repeated assurances about her feelings
- Restricting her social interactions based on his own insecurities

While the girlfriend could have handled some things better (like not bringing up missing the ex or making comparisons), her desire to maintain a friendship with someone she's on good terms with is reasonable. Her hesitation about showing private messages is also understandable - privacy in relationships is important, and once you start monitoring your partner's communications, it sets a concerning precedent.

The author acknowledges being ""paranoid"" and feeling like ""an ass,"" which shows some self-awareness, but continues the controlling behavior anyway. Trust issues and insecurity don't justify restricting a partner's friendships or demanding access to their private communications.

The girlfriend's mixed signals about showing the messages aren't ideal, but this appears to be her struggling between wanting to reassure her boyfriend and maintaining appropriate boundaries.

Xavier's actions were problematic from the start - he shared intimate photos of someone without her consent, which is a serious violation of trust and privacy. He also put you in an uncomfortable position by sharing these photos unsolicited and asking you to keep secrets. His decision to share such photos while pursuing a relationship with this person shows poor judgment.

However, you also made a significant error. When Xavier shared those photos with you in confidence (even though he shouldn't have), you then shared them again with your friend group at the bar. This was a breach of the confidence Xavier placed in you, and more importantly, it further violated the woman's privacy without her knowledge or consent. Even though these are long-term friends, sharing intimate photos of someone else is not appropriate.

The woman in this situation is clearly a victim - her private photos were shared without her consent by multiple people. Raoul appears to have simply informed her of what was happening, which she had a right to know.

While Xavier bears primary responsibility for the initial violation and poor judgment, you also contributed to the harm by further sharing the photos. Both of you violated this woman's privacy and trust.

The wife broke her promise not to contact someone she had developed serious feelings for, which is a significant breach of trust in the marriage. However, the author responded by secretly blocking the other person's number without discussing it with his wife first, which is also a violation of trust and autonomy.

While the author's frustration is understandable given the broken promise, taking unilateral action to block someone's number without communication represents a controlling behavior rather than addressing the underlying trust issues. The wife's continued contact despite her promise is also problematic and shows disrespect for the marriage boundaries.

Both parties have contributed to this situation - the wife through broken promises and potentially inappropriate contact, and the author through secretive controlling actions rather than direct communication about the trust issues.

Unfortunately, she happen...",Author,Author,0.8,0.6829268292682927,False,"This is a deeply complex situation involving fundamental life decisions, genetic risks, and conflicting desires within a relationship.

The author is grappling with a legitimate concern about passing on a potentially serious genetic condition to future children. Their worry about children potentially suffering from this autoimmune disease is understandable and comes from a place of wanting to prevent harm. However, their approach and reasoning reveal some problematic aspects:

1. They're making unilateral decisions about major life choices that affect both partners
2. They're rejecting adoption while still wanting biological children, which seems inconsistent with their stated concern about children's wellbeing
3. They're essentially asking their partner to give up on having children due to something completely beyond her control
4. The framing suggests the genetic condition makes having children ""selfish,"" which could be deeply hurtful to someone living with that condition

The partner's upset reaction is completely understandable - being told that your genetics make you unsuitable for having children would be devastating.

While the author's concerns about genetic risks aren't inherently wrong, their handling of this situation and their inflexible stance on alternatives like adoption while maintaining they want biological children suggests they haven't fully thought through their position or considered their partner's feelings adequately.

About a month into the r...",Other,Other,0.85,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives and actions of both parties.

The author appears to be taking a reasonable, measured approach to a major life decision. After only 4 months of dating, he's expressing genuine love while also wanting to take practical steps before marriage - like living together first, saving money, and planning a meaningful wedding. His concerns about timing and wanting to ""do things right"" are legitimate and show maturity.

The girlfriend, while her feelings may be genuine, is pushing for immediate marriage multiple times despite his clearly stated position. After he's consistently explained his reasoning, she's now giving him the silent treatment when he maintains his boundary. This pattern of pressuring someone into marriage and then withdrawing communication when they don't comply is problematic behavior.

The author is not being unreasonable by wanting to wait, establish financial stability, and take important relationship steps (like cohabitation) before marriage. His desire to give her a proper wedding rather than a rushed Vegas ceremony actually shows consideration for her. He's been consistent and honest about his feelings and timeline.

The girlfriend's repeated pressure and current silent treatment suggest she's not respecting his boundaries or timeline, which is concerning behavior in a healthy relationship.

The author appears to be engaging in some problematic behaviors:
- Constantly talking about his ex-wife in what seems to be a critical/obsessive manner
- Making judgmental assumptions about how his ex spends money based on superficial observations (her appearance vs. kids' clothes)
- Not respecting his girlfriend's clear boundary when she asked him to stop these discussions
- Seeming to expect his girlfriend to serve as a sounding board for ongoing complaints about his ex

However, the girlfriend's ultimatum approach (""stop talking about your ex or we're done"") is quite harsh and doesn't acknowledge that co-parenting issues are a legitimate part of dating someone with children.

The ex-wife's decision not to allow introductions to the girlfriend after nearly a year of dating may be contributing to tensions, though we don't have enough context about why she's made this choice.

While it's natural for parents to have concerns about their children's welfare and co-parenting situations, the author seems to be crossing the line from legitimate concern into obsessive criticism and venting. His girlfriend has clearly reached her limit with these conversations, suggesting this has been an ongoing pattern that's affecting their relationship negatively.

The author needs to find more appropriate outlets for these concerns (therapy, legal counsel, friends) rather than repeatedly burdening his romantic partner with what appears to be unproductive venting about his ex.

I reached over and ...",Author,Author,0.8,0.7777777777777778,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider both the initial action and how it was handled afterward.

The author made a mistake by liking someone's photo on his sister's Instagram without permission - this could potentially create awkwardness or send unintended signals about his sister's interest level. However, this seems like a relatively minor misstep that could happen between siblings, especially since it was immediately undone.

The more significant issue is how the author responded when his sister expressed that she was upset. Instead of acknowledging her feelings and apologizing right away, he dismissed her concerns by saying she was ""overreacting."" This invalidated her emotions and escalated what could have been resolved with a simple apology.

While the sister's reaction seems quite intense for the situation (involving friends, bringing it up again days later), people can have different comfort levels about social media interactions, especially regarding someone they're interested in romantically. Her feelings, even if they seem disproportionate, were genuine.

The author did eventually apologize, which shows some recognition of wrongdoing, but the initial dismissive response caused unnecessary escalation.

This appears to be primarily about the author's poor handling of the situation after the initial mistake, rather than the Instagram incident itself.

She said we were...",Author,Author,0.85,0.9,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the ethics and norms around intimate images after a breakup.

While you state you won't share or misuse the images, keeping intimate photos of an ex-partner without their consent after a breakup is generally considered inappropriate and potentially harmful behavior. When Amanda explicitly asked you to delete the images and expressed that she would be ""checking your phone,"" she was clearly communicating that your continued possession of these images makes her uncomfortable and violates her boundaries.

The key issues here are:
1. Consent - Amanda originally consented to share these images within the context of your relationship. That context has ended.
2. Her explicit request for deletion shows she has withdrawn that consent
3. Your refusal to respect her clearly stated boundary about her own intimate images
4. The power dynamic this creates, regardless of your stated intentions

Your comparison to her keeping hypothetical images of you isn't equivalent because she's not asking to keep yours - she deleted them and is asking you to do the same. The respectful thing to do when someone asks you to delete their intimate images is to comply, especially after a relationship has ended.

While I don't believe you have malicious intent, refusing to delete intimate images when explicitly asked to do so by the person in them crosses an ethical line.

Your protective instincts are understandable given his traumatic background and behavioral challenges.

However, the core issue here is that you brought a dog with known aggression issues into a social situation without taking proper precautions or communicating the necessary boundaries. You knew your dog gets aggressive when frustrated and doesn't handle unwanted interactions well, yet you didn't speak up when the cousin's behavior was clearly stressing your dog - behavior you describe as ""constantly"" problematic throughout the visit.

While the cousin's actions weren't ideal for your dog, they seem to come from a place of genuine affection and may not fully understand appropriate dog interaction due to their disability. Your boyfriend and his family also couldn't have known to intervene without you communicating your dog's specific needs and boundaries.

The fact that you're asking if you're overreacting suggests you recognize there's a disconnect between your internal frustration and your external response. Your dog's wellbeing is important, but it's your responsibility as the owner to advocate for him appropriately and manage situations that could be problematic.

The author expressed clear romantic interest in this person from the very beginning and communicated their feelings openly to their friend M. When M was added on Snapchat, the author directly communicated that it would hurt their feelings if M added him back, yet M chose to do so anyway, citing not wanting to ""look like an asshole"" to someone she claimed not to be interested in.

M then continued communicating with this person despite knowing it hurt her best friend, and eventually developed feelings herself. While people can't control developing feelings, M's actions show a pattern of disregarding her friend's clearly communicated boundaries and feelings.

However, the author's approach of making M ""choose"" between the friendship and pursuing the guy was also problematic - ultimatums in friendships are generally unhealthy.

That said, M's behavior throughout this situation shows a lack of consideration for a 6-year friendship. She repeatedly chose actions that she knew would hurt her best friend, first by adding him back when asked not to, then by continuing to communicate with him despite being told it was hurtful, and finally by pursuing someone she knew her friend had strong feelings for.

The author has the right to end a friendship when they feel their boundaries and feelings are consistently disregarded.

Legally, you're correct that you have no obligation since you're not on the lease. However, this appears to be a situation where you both made a mutual decision to move in together and split costs, with the understanding that you'd both be responsible for your shares. The fact that only one person is on the lease seems more like a practical arrangement rather than an intentional way to avoid responsibility.

Your ex didn't unilaterally decide to break up just to stick you with bills - breakups happen, and the housing situation is an unfortunate consequence. You both benefited from the arrangement when you were together, and you both are dealing with the fallout now.

While your mother's advice focuses on your legal rights and financial self-interest, there's a moral dimension here. Leaving your ex to handle the full financial burden for three months (until she can find a subletter) when you both entered into this living arrangement together would cause significant financial hardship through no fault of her own.

Your willingness to continue paying your half shows good character and recognition of the shared responsibility you both took on when you decided to move in together.

The author expresses several concerning viewpoints:
- Making broad generalizations about women (""most females live on recruit difficulty"")
- Policing women's clothing choices and calling their dress ""inappropriate""

- Dismissing legitimate concerns about sexism from a long-term friend
- Using derogatory language (""slander on women"")
- Showing a pattern of causing conflict in the friendship

While the friend may sometimes get heated in discussions, this appears to be a reasonable response to repeatedly encountering sexist attitudes. The author acknowledges this is a recurring pattern where the friend is ""always the one that is mad"" - which suggests the author consistently expresses views the friend finds offensive.

The author is making judgmental statements about women's autonomy, choices, and perceived ""privileges"" while dismissing valid feedback about how these views come across. Even if some individual points might have merit in isolation, the overall pattern shows problematic attitudes toward women and an unwillingness to self-reflect when called out by someone who knows them well.

The mother-in-law is clearly at fault for placing a vulnerable puppy on the ground near a dog with known severe food aggression while food was present. This was a predictable and preventable incident. The sister-in-law is also responsible as the owner of an aggressive dog that has apparently attacked other dogs before without proper management or training.

The author's anger is completely justified - their puppy nearly died due to others' negligence. Calling the aggressive dog a ""monster"" and refusing babysitting services from someone who demonstrated poor judgment are reasonable protective responses, not asshole behavior.

The family members are deflecting responsibility, minimizing the severity of what happened, making the author feel guilty for being upset, and failing to provide genuine apologies or accountability. The mother-in-law's behavior at the vet (performing sadness for staff, complaining about vet bills, getting angry at the victim) is particularly problematic.

The author is 21 and moving back temporarily to their mother's place. While they're willing to contribute to groceries and household expenses, they want to hide their money to avoid their mother asking for ""a chunk of it.""

The mother's behavior of demanding to know exact bank balances and expecting ""chunks"" of money goes beyond reasonable expectations for household contribution from an adult child. While parents can set rules about contribution to household expenses, demanding access to private financial information and significant portions of savings is overreaching.

The author initiated the conflict by making what they called a ""light-hearted comment"" about their friend not eating much, then laughing when the friend said she felt full and sick. Even if intended as lighthearted, commenting on someone's eating habits can be sensitive territory, and the laughter likely came across as dismissive of the friend's stated physical feelings.

However, the friend's response was disproportionate and hurtful. Instead of simply explaining she wasn't hungry or asking the author to stop commenting on her eating, she launched into a lengthy critique calling the author's normal eating habits ""gross"" and excessive.

The way he approached the confrontation was also relatively mature - he asked open-ended questions first (""Do you have anything to say to me?"" and ""What happened during the schooltrip?"") before directly addressing the rumor. This gave her an opportunity to volunteer any information.

The girlfriend's reaction, while understandable given that she was innocent, doesn't make the author wrong for bringing up his concerns. In healthy relationships, partners should be able to discuss worries and rumors, even if they turn out to be false.

3. The drunk texts themselves, which seem to be causing unnecessary anxiety

At the same time, your acknowledged trust issues and ACOA diagnosis suggest you may be more sensitive to these situations than others might be. This doesn't invalidate your feelings, but it's worth considering how much your past experiences might be amplifying current concerns.

The core issue seems to be a mismatch in communication styles and expectations rather than anyone being deliberately harmful. She may not see the need to report her activities, while you need that communication for security in the relationship.

This appears to be a compatibility and communication issue that both parties need to work on together.

The author has legitimate concerns about what appears to be preferential treatment - one person gets early access while others, including a 20-year member, are denied the same privilege. The stated reason (manager's safety concerns) may be valid, but it does create an appearance of unfairness that would naturally frustrate other members.

However, the author's reasoning about being talked about seems based on speculation rather than concrete evidence. The fact that another gym member didn't want to get involved doesn't necessarily mean they were the subject of conversation - people often avoid gym drama regardless of the topic.

The key question is whether being upset about this situation makes the author at fault. Having feelings of frustration about perceived unfair treatment is a normal human response. The author asked a reasonable question about early access and expressed their displeasure when denied - these are not unreasonable actions.

While the manager may have valid safety reasons for their policy, and the speculation about being talked about may be unfounded, simply being upset about the situation doesn't make someone at fault. People are entitled to their feelings, especially when they perceive unfair treatment.

The author is dealing with significant health challenges (cancer remission, multiple surgeries, compromised immune system, chronic pain) and is actively trying to find work despite these obstacles. When attempting to complete job applications - something her husband has been pressuring her to do - she communicated her sensory overload issues but tried to accommodate his gaming by saying the volume was manageable.

The husband's behavior shows a concerning lack of consideration. He knew she was applying for jobs (which he had been pushing her to do), knew she was having sensory issues that day, yet chose to blast music loudly and sing along repeatedly. When she expressed frustration, he deflected responsibility by saying she should have left the room instead of acknowledging his inconsiderate timing.

While the author admits her tone was harsh, this appears to be a reasonable response to ongoing inconsiderate behavior, especially given the context that he's been pressuring her to find work while simultaneously making it difficult for her to do so. His argument that she should have left the shared living space rather than him showing basic consideration is particularly problematic.

The husband's actions directly undermined something he claimed to want (her job searching) and showed disregard for her clearly communicated needs and health challenges.

Th...",Other,Other,0.85,0.7142857142857143,True,"Looking at this situation, I can see someone who has been consistently thoughtful and generous with others but is receiving little to no reciprocation on their own birthday. The author goes above and beyond for family members' birthdays - buying cakes, cards, planning dinners, sending memes - yet receives minimal acknowledgment in return.

The author's feelings are completely understandable and valid. They're not asking for extravagant celebrations, just basic recognition and perhaps a simple cake. The fact that family members have forgotten entirely for two years, leaving the author to have cereal for their birthday dinner, shows a concerning lack of consideration from the family.

The author has been overly generous without setting appropriate expectations or boundaries, but this doesn't make them at fault for wanting basic birthday recognition. Their family members, including parents and siblings who benefit from the author's thoughtfulness, have failed to show even minimal reciprocal care. The fiancé's oversight is particularly concerning given their close relationship.

While the author could have communicated their expectations more clearly earlier, the primary issue is the family's lack of consideration and reciprocity after years of receiving generous treatment.

Your girlfriend has experienced severe trauma that clearly affects how she processes and responds to everyday conversations. Her responses seem to be coming from a place of pain rather than malicious intent to bring you down.

However, your feelings of frustration are also completely understandable. Constantly having positive moments or casual comments met with trauma responses would be emotionally draining for anyone. It's natural to want to share excitement or mundane thoughts without them being consistently redirected to painful topics.

The core issue seems to be that your girlfriend may need professional help to process her trauma in healthier ways, and you both might benefit from learning better communication strategies. Her pattern of responses suggests she's struggling to engage with normal conversation without filtering everything through her traumatic experiences.

Neither of you appears to be intentionally trying to hurt the other. She's likely not aware of how her responses affect you, and you're trying to be supportive while dealing with your own emotional needs.

This seems like a situation where both people have valid feelings and needs, but the dynamic isn't working well for either of you. Professional counseling (individual for her, possibly couples counseling) could help tremendously.

The pact was made during a moment of stress and fear in junior year when both friends felt overwhelmed and hopeless about their academic prospects. It was essentially a mutual support agreement born out of anxiety rather than a carefully considered life decision. The author has since improved academically and achieved their dream school acceptance, while the friend has continued to struggle.

While breaking promises can hurt relationships, this particular promise was problematic from the start because:

1. It was made during an emotional low point, not as a rational life plan
2. It would require the author to sacrifice a major life opportunity they worked hard for
3. It essentially asks someone to limit their potential to match another's circumstances
4. The friend's anger seems to stem more from his own disappointment and comparison than from genuine betrayal

The author shows genuine care for their friend's feelings and wants to maintain the relationship, which demonstrates good intentions. However, expecting someone to give up their dream school to honor a pact made during a crisis is unreasonable.

The friend's feelings are understandable but directing anger at the author for succeeding is not fair. A true friend should be happy for such an achievement, even while dealing with their own disappointment.

The husband did make an effort - he went out, placed the order correctly (as evidenced by the receipt), and brought back food. The restaurant error wasn't his fault. However, his refusal to return for the correct order, especially knowing this was a rare treat due to financial constraints, shows a lack of consideration for his wife's feelings.

The wife's disappointment is understandable - takeout is rare for them, she was looking forward to her specific order, and she feels her husband wouldn't make the same effort for her that she would for him. However, escalating this to shouting and ruining the entire evening over a restaurant mistake seems disproportionate, especially when there was still edible food available.

Both parties contributed to turning a frustrating but minor situation into a major conflict. The husband could have been more accommodating about returning to fix the error, and the wife could have handled her disappointment without letting it escalate to shouting and complete relationship discord.

This appears to be more about underlying relationship dynamics and feeling valued than about the food order itself.

The girlfriend's responses do come across as quite curt and defensive. When you mentioned picking up the item, her correction about not ""wanting"" it but just being able to get it there seems like an overreaction to what was clearly meant as a helpful suggestion. Her follow-up ""I don't want to go"" and then the sharp ""so i don't need your dots ty"" response was unnecessarily harsh for what should have been a simple planning conversation.

However, your ""okie, it was just a suggestion..."" with the ellipsis did come across as passive-aggressive, even if unintentionally. The dots typically signal annoyance or frustration in text communication, and your girlfriend picked up on that tone.

That said, her reaction was disproportionate to your relatively mild response. She escalated the situation by focusing intensely on the ellipsis rather than moving forward with planning, and her claim that you ""reacted so badly"" seems like an overstatement given that you simply acknowledged her preference and tried to continue planning.

The author and her husband had an established system that worked well - he gave 80% of his paycheck for bills and expenses, with the remainder split appropriately. This system ensured bills were paid and allowed for savings.

The husband unilaterally changed this arrangement, now keeping 50% of his income while still expecting the author to pay all bills and expenses with the reduced amount (45-50%). This creates an obvious mathematical problem - the same expenses cannot be covered with significantly less money.

The husband is being unreasonable by:
1. Reducing the household budget without adjusting bill responsibilities
2. Getting upset when bills can't be paid with insufficient funds
3. Not contributing his retained portion to household expenses
4. Failing to recognize the logical impossibility of his expectations

The author is simply pointing out that the current arrangement is financially unsustainable and requesting a return to a workable system. She's not asking for personal spending money - she's asking for enough money to cover the household's basic needs and obligations.

This appears to be a case where one person (the husband) has created an unreasonable situation through poor financial planning and unrealistic expectations.

The author was dealing with hunger and a bad mood, which are understandable human experiences. The girlfriend's forgetfulness and difficulty with a simple task were frustrating, especially when he was already feeling unwell and hungry.

However, the author's response was disproportionate and inappropriate. He:
- Reacted with visible anger to a minor inconvenience
- Physically bumped into his girlfriend (even if accidental, it occurred during an angry outburst)
- Spoke to her condescendingly (""told her that it was that easy"")
- Let his bad mood dictate his treatment of someone he cares about

While the girlfriend's public screaming wasn't ideal, it appears to be a reaction to feeling hurt and disrespected by his behavior. Her choice to take the bus instead of riding with him suggests she felt unsafe or uncomfortable with his anger.

Being in a bad mood or being hungry doesn't justify treating a partner poorly. The author acknowledges he was angry and acted on that anger in ways that hurt his girlfriend, even if some actions were unintentional.

S made the initial error by deviating from the agreed-upon plan without consultation, then publicly calling out the teens in a way that could be embarrassing. When you provided gentle feedback about sticking to the plan, S became defensive rather than acknowledging the team decision.

However, S's behavior became more problematic when she insisted on the follow-up meeting and then trapped you in a circular 45-minute conversation trying to force you to agree with her position.

The key facts are:
- No planning was done initially - everyone just ""winged it"" when moving in
- You brought your own bed frame and mattress
- The roommates bought a bunk bed together with their own mattresses
- Everyone agrees solo is the best sleeping arrangement
- You ended up with the solo bed by chance, not by any agreed-upon system
- The topic of switching has now come up for discussion

While you do own your bed frame, the fundamental issue is that you got the most desirable sleeping arrangement purely by luck, not through any fair process or agreement. Your roommates are reasonably asking to discuss rotating or finding a fair way to share the best spot. 

Your reasons for not wanting to switch (comfort, tossing and turning) are understandable personal preferences, but they're not necessarily more valid than your roommates' desire for better sleeping arrangements. The ownership of the bed frame, while relevant, doesn't automatically entitle you to the best spot forever when no initial agreement was made about sleeping arrangements.

A fair approach would be to work together on a solution - whether that's rotation, compensation, or some other arrangement that acknowledges everyone's needs and contributions.

Refusing to even consider alternatives or discuss a fair solution would be unreasonable given the circumstances.

Your father, as the host at his own holiday home and the person who prepared the barbecue, made a polite request for you to move seats. While you had been sitting there for an hour, this doesn't create an immutable claim to that spot, especially when the meal was actually beginning and seating arrangements naturally shift.

Your reasoning for refusing - that your rationale was ""the same as his"" plus you were already there - doesn't fully account for the context. He was hosting, had just finished cooking, and made a reasonable request. The fact that there was a perfectly good seat next to your mother available makes this less about being displaced and more about principle.

Your admission that you ""don't like doing things simply because someone says so"" suggests this became more about asserting independence than the actual seat. While that's understandable at 21, threatening to leave the family meal over a seating request escalated the situation unnecessarily.

That said, your father's threat to ""be very angry"" if you didn't move was also an escalation, though it came after you had already refused his initial polite request.

The rest of your family convincing you to move suggests they saw this as a reasonable compromise that you were resisting.

The author is facing a genuine ethical dilemma between loyalty to their spouse and concern for an innocent person being deceived. Their empathy for Brooke, especially given their own experience with infidelity, is understandable and shows moral concern.

However, several factors point toward the author being at fault if they act on this impulse:

1. **Breach of marital trust**: The information came to them through their husband's confidence. Breaking this trust could seriously damage their marriage.

2. **Secondhand information**: They don't have direct knowledge of the affair - this is information filtered through multiple people, which could lead to misunderstandings or incomplete facts.

3. **Not their relationship to manage**: While the desire to help is admirable, inserting themselves into other people's marriages based on secondhand information crosses appropriate boundaries.

4. **Potential for greater harm**: Their intervention could backfire, potentially making things worse for everyone involved, including Brooke and her children.

The husband, while perhaps overly rigid in his stance, is trying to maintain appropriate boundaries and protect his own relationships. Scott is clearly the primary wrongdoer here, but the question is specifically about the author's potential actions.

The author and boyfriend were upfront about not being tidy people in their rental posting, and the roommate agreed to this arrangement. However, there seems to be a disconnect between what ""a little messy"" means to different people. The author admits they let the kitchen get ""messier than usual"" after the roommate moved in, which suggests they may have become more relaxed about cleanliness than what was originally communicated.

The roommate's passive-aggressive approach (cleaning while complaining, texting the boyfriend instead of speaking directly, making pointed comments about being tired from cleaning) is problematic communication. However, her core concern about wanting a reasonably clean shared space is legitimate, especially since she's paying rent and keeping her own areas clean.

The author has shown some responsiveness by cleaning up when asked and trying to maintain better standards afterward. But there's also a defensive tone suggesting they feel the roommate should just accept whatever level of mess they create since they ""warned"" her.

The father's approach of going through the author rather than addressing concerns directly with his wife initially wasn't effective. The family seems to lack healthy communication patterns and conflict resolution skills.

The mother appears to be using this app as an escape from something - possibly depression, midlife dissatisfaction, or feeling unappreciated. While her coping mechanism has become problematic, the family's approach to addressing it hasn't been particularly compassionate or solution-focused.

This is a situation where everyone has contributed to the dysfunction, though in different ways and to different degrees.

You're being dishonest with people who care about you and not living up to commitments you've made.

However, what you're describing sounds like classic symptoms of depression or another mental health condition - the lack of motivation, feeling like nothing matters, substance use as coping, and the emotional numbness you're experiencing. These are serious mental health symptoms, not character flaws.

While you are responsible for your choices (skipping class, drinking despite promises, half-assing commitments), the underlying issue appears to be untreated mental health struggles rather than simple moral failings. The fact that you recognize the problem and feel guilty about it actually suggests you do care, even if you can't feel it right now.

The real issue isn't whether you're ""bad"" for struggling - it's that you need help and support to address what's causing these behaviors. Your parents, teammates, and others who care about you would likely prefer honesty about your struggles over continued pretense.

However, the pattern of sending ""bitchy emails"" rather than having direct conversations about care responsibilities suggests a communication approach that's likely counterproductive. While your siblings should absolutely be contributing more to your mother's care (and previously your grandmother's), attacking them via email typically makes people defensive rather than helpful.

The core issue - that you're shouldering disproportionate caregiving responsibilities while they remain uninvolved - is legitimate. But the method of addressing it through angry emails rather than constructive family discussions about sharing responsibilities isn't effective.

Your siblings are clearly at fault for not stepping up appropriately, but your communication approach is also problematic and likely making the situation worse rather than better.

The author's concern for potential suffering is understandable and comes from a place of genuine care. However, suggesting abortion or vasectomy to someone whose religious beliefs explicitly oppose these options crosses significant boundaries of personal autonomy and respect for others' deeply held convictions.

Key considerations:
- The brother and his wife are making informed decisions based on their values and beliefs
- They have the right to make reproductive choices without unsolicited medical advice from family members
- Religious freedom includes the right to make life decisions according to one's faith
- The author's anger at their ""letting religious beliefs get in the way"" shows a fundamental lack of respect for their autonomy
- While the concern is genuine, imposing one's own values on others' reproductive decisions is inappropriate

The brother and his wife are not at fault for making reproductive choices consistent with their beliefs and values, even if others disagree with those choices. The author would be at fault for overstepping boundaries by suggesting abortion or sterilization to people whose religious convictions oppose these options.

Jokes about someone's financial situation are particularly sensitive because poverty can be a source of real shame and stress for people. The fact that your friend cried indicates these comments genuinely hurt them, regardless of your intent. Your recognition that you feel ""so bad"" shows you understand the impact of your words.

The author has very reasonable concerns about:

- Risk of being associated with ongoing criminal investigations
- The safety and stability of their own family
- The appropriateness of exposing their children to this level of dysfunction

The author is also offering a generous compromise - paying 1-2 months rent for an apartment, which would still provide substantial help while maintaining appropriate boundaries.

The wife's desire to help is admirable and comes from a good place, but calling the author ""selfish"" for having legitimate safety concerns about their own family crosses a line. While helping others is important, a parent's first responsibility is to their own children's safety and wellbeing.

The author is being reasonable by wanting to help in a way that doesn't potentially endanger their family or expose them to criminal investigations. Setting boundaries while still offering significant financial assistance is not selfish - it's responsible parenting.

The author acknowledges that companies aren't obligated to provide Christmas bonuses at all, which shows some awareness of the reality. However, they're expressing disappointment about a significant reduction from what appears to have been a substantial bonus (equivalent to a full paycheck) down to $30 after taxes.

While the author's disappointment is understandable given the dramatic decrease, their reaction seems proportionate rather than entitled. They're not demanding anything, just expressing how the change feels to them. The comparison to it being ""less of a slap to the face"" to receive nothing suggests they understand this is about perception and morale rather than entitlement.

Companies do have the right to adjust or eliminate bonuses based on their financial situation, and we don't have information about the company's current financial state or reasoning for the reduction. The author hasn't indicated they've complained to management or made unreasonable demands.

The author's feelings are valid human reactions to what they perceive as reduced appreciation, but they're not acting inappropriately on those feelings.

The author approached this thoughtfully - he recognized the statements weren't literally about him, waited until it became a pattern that genuinely bothered him, and addressed it privately and respectfully with his friend. His analogy comparing ""I hate men"" to other demographic generalizations was meant to illustrate why such statements can feel hurtful to group members, even when not intended that way.

However, the friend's response was problematic. Instead of acknowledging his feelings or engaging with his perspective, she:
- Dismissed his concerns entirely
- Made an accusatory implication that his discomfort suggests he's ""doing something bad""
- Refused to consider that her language might be hurtful to a friend
- Escalated by involving mutual friends to pressure him

While I understand the broader social context around expressions like ""I hate men"" and that they often stem from frustration with systemic issues, the friend's complete unwillingness to show empathy for how her words affected someone she cares about, combined with her defensive and accusatory response, makes her primarily at fault here.

The author handled this maturely by communicating his feelings directly and privately, while the friend responded with dismissiveness and hostility.

Let me work through this carefully.

The author and their sister are seeking to connect with potential half-siblings they discovered through DNA testing after their abusive father's death. Their mother believes this could harm innocent people, particularly a young woman who may not know the truth about her parentage.

Key considerations:
- The author has legitimate desires to understand their family and connect with potential siblings
- The approach taken (direct messaging asking about parents) was relatively tactful and didn't reveal sensitive details
- However, this does risk exposing family secrets that could be devastating to others
- The potential half-sister and her family have a right to their privacy and current family structure
- There are innocent parties (like the girl's presumed father) who could be deeply hurt

The author isn't malicious - they're processing trauma and seeking family connections, which is understandable. But their mother raises valid concerns about the potential collateral damage to people who had no part in the original situation.

The core tension is between the author's right to seek family connections and others' rights to privacy and protection from potentially life-altering revelations.

This seems like a situation where good intentions could lead to unintended harm, but the author's desires are legitimate and their approach has been reasonably careful so far.

The author is being practical about finances - staying in a stable job with good benefits and growth potential rather than taking on student debt makes financial sense. However, the approach to addressing their financial struggles seems problematic.

The wife has legitimate medical conditions (fibromyalgia and anxiety) that genuinely impact her work capacity. These are real disabilities that can significantly limit job options. However, her immediate defensiveness and refusal to even consider alternatives, while claiming only she faces limitations, suggests some rigidity in her thinking.

The core issue is that when the wife brought up the author going back to school (again), the author's response was essentially ""no, you should change instead."" This creates a dynamic where each person is asking the other to make sacrifices while being unwilling to consider changes themselves. The author dismissed the wife's medical limitations, while the wife dismissed the author's practical financial reasoning.

Both parties are being somewhat inflexible - the author in not acknowledging the real impact of chronic illness on job searching, and the wife in refusing to explore any alternatives while expecting the author to take on debt and career risk.

The author isn't wrong to suggest job alternatives could exist, but the delivery and timing (immediately after rejecting the wife's suggestion) made it seem dismissive of her real medical challenges.

The author's feelings of shock and confusion upon learning this information are understandable - this was clearly unexpected news that challenged his assumptions. It's also valid that he may not be comfortable dating a transgender person, as people have the right to their dating preferences.

However, the author's reaction was extremely hurtful and cruel. Calling Ashley a ""liar"" and saying she ""tricked"" him, telling her to ""get out,"" referring to her as ""whatever you are,"" and giving her an ultimatum to leave in 5 seconds were all unnecessarily harsh and dehumanizing responses. Ashley was trying to have an honest conversation about something very personal and vulnerable.

Ashley's timing in disclosure is a complex issue - there are valid safety concerns that transgender people face, and she may have been waiting until she felt safe and trusted the author. While earlier disclosure might have been preferable, her approach of wanting to explain before becoming more intimate shows she was trying to be honest at an appropriate moment.

While both parties made errors in communication, the author's response of simply leaving without any explanation was unprofessional and potentially harmful. Even if overwhelmed, the appropriate response would have been to briefly explain they weren't qualified for this type of care and help ensure the child wasn't left unattended.

However, once you're broken up, she has the right to make her own choices about who she dates and what she does, even if those choices seem insensitive or hurtful to you. Your feelings of hurt and betrayal are valid, but calling her derogatory names crosses a line.

Your friend who started dating her so quickly after your breakup also showed poor judgment in terms of friendship loyalty, though technically he wasn't obligated to avoid her.

The author is dealing with legitimate frustration - their mother's severe dietary restrictions (despite negative allergy tests) are impacting family activities and social dining. The mother's belief that a shot caused her intolerances, combined with extreme avoidance behaviors, suggests this may be more psychological than physiological.

However, the author's response was dismissive and insensitive. Even if the mother's symptoms are psychosomatic or anxiety-related, her distress is real. Making a ""snide dumb joke about try telling that to a doctor"" when she's expressing physical discomfort was unnecessarily cruel and unhelpful.

The mother also bears some responsibility - her extreme restrictions are affecting the family, and her unwillingness to consider that her symptoms might not be allergy-related (especially after negative tests) is creating ongoing challenges for everyone.

Both parties could have handled this better: the author could have been more compassionate and supportive while still expressing concerns, and the mother could be more open to exploring the psychological aspects of her symptoms or finding compromises that don't severely limit family activities.

The author is genuinely trying to learn Portuguese - taking classes, using Duolingo, reading textbooks, and putting in effort despite finding it very difficult and expensive.

Learning a new language as an adult is genuinely challenging, especially when tired from work.

The boyfriend tried dog meat while studying abroad in China, where it is part of some regional cuisines, though increasingly controversial even there. He was curious about local food culture and tried it in that context. When asked directly, he was honest about his experience rather than lying. He also acknowledged that the Yulin festival is cruel and said he probably wouldn't eat it again.

The author has every right to her strong feelings about dogs and to end a relationship over fundamental value differences. Her emotional reaction is understandable given her deep love for dogs. However, her reaction seems to lack consideration for cultural context and treats her boyfriend as if he committed an unforgivable moral transgression for a food choice made in a different cultural setting years ago.

The boyfriend could have been more sensitive in how he discussed this topic, knowing how much she loves dogs. The author could have tried to understand the cultural context before having such an extreme reaction.

Recognizing your limits and the potential danger to your own wellbeing shows self-awareness, not selfishness.

You already did something heroic - you likely saved your friend's life by calling for help and performing CPR. You cleaned up after the crisis and visited her in the hospital. You've already been there for her in the most critical way possible.

Taking care of yourself now is not abandonment - it's necessary. You cannot pour from an empty cup, and pushing yourself beyond your limits could result in harm to both of you. Your friend needs you alive and healthy in the long run, not burned out or relapsed.

Going on the camping trip to decompress and heal is not selfish - it's responsible self-care. You can still support your friend in other ways (through other mutual friends, cards, etc.) while maintaining healthy boundaries.

I have bipolar one disorde...",Author,Author,0.85,0.6,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the medical realities of bipolar disorder and medication management.

The author has bipolar I disorder and has stopped taking prescribed medication and missed appointments without proper medical supervision. While they feel ""fine"" and ""mature,"" this perception of not needing medication is actually a common symptom when people with bipolar disorder go off their meds - they often feel normal or even better initially. The psychologist's note about apathy and the previous need for both medication and monthly shots suggests this is a serious condition requiring ongoing treatment.

Bipolar I disorder can involve severe manic episodes that can be dangerous to the person and others. Stopping medication abruptly, especially antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, can lead to serious rebound effects and relapse. The author's reasoning (""I feel normal,"" ""I'm mature now,"" ""I haven't done anything irrational"") reflects common cognitive patterns seen when people with bipolar disorder discontinue treatment.

While the mother's Facebook posting was inappropriate and violated privacy, her concern about her child stopping psychiatric medication is medically justified. The author is legally an adult and has the right to make this choice, but that doesn't make it medically sound or free from consequences.

The author is making a potentially dangerous medical decision based on flawed reasoning that's characteristic of their condition, while dismissing professional medical advice.

The author contributes 70% to the joint account and makes significantly more money, while her boyfriend contributes when able but sometimes misses months. She purchased $130 heels for a required work event and charged them to the joint account without prior discussion.

The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate given the financial imbalance - he spends $300/week on weed (which he justifies as work-related) while objecting to a one-time $130 purchase. However, the author did make the purchase without discussing it first, which violates good joint account etiquette.

The core issues are:
1. Lack of communication before the purchase
2. Inconsistent standards for what constitutes ""work expenses""
3. The boyfriend's harsh reaction despite contributing much less to the account
4. Poor overall financial communication between the couple

While the author should have discussed the purchase beforehand, the boyfriend's reaction and double standard (his $300/week weed vs. her $130 shoes) make his response unreasonable. The author's purchase was legitimately work-related for a required event.

This appears to be more about control and inconsistent standards than the actual money, especially given the contribution disparity.

The author has legitimate concerns about animal welfare - a 12+ hour daily absence seems problematic for a high-energy breed like a husky, and introducing a young dog to an elderly, anxious dog does carry risks. These are valid considerations that come from a place of caring about the animals' wellbeing.

However, the author has already expressed their concerns once (""just make sure you've thought it through"") and received a clear, defensive response indicating the friend doesn't welcome this input. The friend and her boyfriend are adults who presumably understand their own situation, work schedules, and current pet better than an outside observer.

While the author's concerns may be well-founded, continuing to push the issue after being rebuffed would cross into overstepping boundaries. Adult friends have the right to make their own decisions, even if others disagree with those choices. The author's role as a friend doesn't extend to repeatedly challenging major life decisions after their input has been clearly unwelcome.

The most appropriate course would be to let it go at this point, while remaining supportive if problems do arise later.

We did not hav...,Author,Author,0.75,0.8148148148148148,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the complexities of child support, parental responsibilities, and the circumstances described.

The author is asking whether she would be wrong to request increased child support from her ex when his income increases significantly upon graduation. Child support is specifically meant to support the child they share together, and it's reasonable and legally standard for support amounts to be adjusted when a parent's income changes substantially.

However, there are concerning elements here:
- The author explicitly states she wants the increased support ""so that I will have more money to support my whole family"" - indicating she intends to use money meant for one child to support her other children
- She has a pattern of asking for extra money while making choices (having more children, not working) that strain her finances
- She's living as a stay-at-home parent while struggling financially, suggesting she could potentially work to improve the situation

The ex-boyfriend appears to be meeting his current obligations and has valid concerns about how additional money might be used.

While requesting a child support modification based on increased income is legitimate, the author's stated intention to use that money for her entire family rather than specifically for their shared child, combined with her pattern of financial dependence and choices that have worsened her situation, suggests she bears primary responsibility for the ethical concerns in this scenario.

The author, a 25-year-old adult, made inappropriate sexual jokes to a 16-year-old who had just turned 16, including a ""legal in certain countries"" comment and BDSM references. When the minor expressed discomfort by saying ""no,"" the author continued with dark humor about human experimentation despite the teen's continued objections. The author then escalated by making cruel personal attacks, calling the teen ""basically an insect"" and saying he ""won't amount to anything in life.""

The 16-year-old's response of involving others and messaging the author's fiancé, while perhaps not the most direct approach, is understandable given the power imbalance and his discomfort with the situation. His subsequent behavior may have been immature, but this is expected from someone his age dealing with an uncomfortable situation with an adult.

The core issue here is that a 25-year-old adult made sexual jokes toward a minor, continued inappropriate behavior despite signs of discomfort, and then responded to the fallout with cruel personal attacks. The significant age and maturity gap makes the adult primarily responsible for maintaining appropriate boundaries and handling conflict maturely.

The author admits to snapping and being more aggressive than necessary (""DUDE! WHAT.DO.YOU.WANT!?!?""). While their frustration with lengthy preambles is understandable, the escalation to shouting was disproportionate to the situation. The person approaching them was being polite initially and trying to provide context.

However, the other person's reaction at the end was also problematic - responding with indignation and profanity (""MAN. Serious. Can't believe you man! The hell is that shit?"") when simply told ""I don't have cash"" was an overreaction that escalated the conflict further.

The author could have handled this more patiently or politely asked the person to get to the point.

Your protective instincts are understandable and come from a place of love.

However, the key issue here is that you've given your 18-year-old sister an ultimatum about her relationship - essentially saying you ""won't allow"" her to continue seeing someone unless she meets your conditions. While your concerns about the age gap are valid, your sister is legally an adult who has the right to make her own relationship choices, even if they seem unwise.

Your approach of demanding to meet him and issuing ultimatums is likely to backfire by pushing her away and making her more secretive, rather than keeping her safe. A more effective approach would be expressing your concerns supportively, staying available as a trusted confidant, and perhaps suggesting she talk to other trusted adults or resources about healthy relationships.

The age gap itself is concerning, but without more information about the specific dynamics, manipulation, or harmful behavior, it's difficult to definitively label the older man as predatory based solely on age difference and your sister's secrecy.

The author is using their own birthday money to purchase a Pro Controller specifically to address a problem (Joy-Con drift) that's preventing them from enjoying games they paid for with their own subscription. They have legitimate concerns about their brother's track record with electronics - multiple drops of the Switch, throwing controllers when angry, and a pattern of using others' belongings to avoid spending his own money.

The brother has alternative ways to play his preferred games (Fortnite on laptop, YouTube still works with drift), while the author's main game (Super Smash Bros Ultimate online) is genuinely unplayable with drifting Joy-Cons. The author also makes a fair distinction about consent - they ask permission to use the brother's headphones and would respect a ""no.""

While sharing is generally good family practice, the author shouldn't be obligated to share something they purchased with their own money, especially given reasonable concerns about care and the brother's access to alternatives.

The author has legitimate feelings of being unappreciated - there's a clear pattern of them putting significant effort into special occasions (planning Yosemite trip, buying gifts) while their husband has consistently failed to reciprocate or show appreciation for important dates like anniversaries, Valentine's Day, and birthdays. The husband's last-minute approach to the author's birthday is particularly telling.

However, this specific request isn't about gift-giving or special occasions - it's about practical help with a car repair that could save them money as a household. The author acknowledges they have the skill to help and that it would benefit them financially.

The core issue seems to be using this practical situation as leverage for unrelated relationship problems. While the author's feelings about being unappreciated are valid, withholding help on car repairs as a way to express those feelings isn't the most constructive approach. The underlying problems about appreciation and effort in the relationship need to be addressed directly through communication.

The husband isn't blameless here - his pattern of neglecting important occasions has created this dynamic where the author feels taken for granted.

The author acknowledges they care about their abused friend and recognize that dating her abuser would be ""detrimental"" to her. Despite this awareness, they're choosing to pursue a romantic relationship with someone who sexually abused their close friend. The plan to keep this secret and ""make sure she would never find out"" shows they understand the betrayal this represents, yet they're proceeding anyway.

While the abuser may have genuinely changed through therapy, this doesn't erase the harm caused or eliminate the impact on the victim. The author is prioritizing their romantic interests over their friendship and their friend's wellbeing. The fact that they're already involving others in keeping this secret (the boyfriend knows) makes it likely the truth will eventually come out, potentially causing even greater harm through the betrayal of secrecy.

The abused friend trusted the author as a supportive ally. Dating her abuser - regardless of claimed change or intentions to keep it secret - fundamentally violates that trust and the loyalty expected in such a friendship.

The author is making a choice that they themselves recognize as harmful to someone they claim to care about, while trying to rationalize it through secrecy and belief in the abuser's change.

You were asked to make extra food for the family, which is a reasonable request. When you declined due to being tired, that's also understandable. However, the situation escalated when you became frustrated and started crying, which suggests the interaction may have been more intense than described.

The key issue is your mother's later comments about you being ""negative,"" ""cruel,"" and ""abusive."" These are strong words that suggest your behavior during the conflict was more problematic than you may realize. When someone is stressed and exhausted, they can sometimes come across as harsh or dismissive without fully realizing it.

The author has clearly communicated that he doesn't want his girlfriend to pop his pimples anymore. This is his body, and he has every right to set boundaries about what happens to it. The fact that he previously allowed it doesn't mean he's obligated to continue allowing it forever - consent can be withdrawn at any time.

The girlfriend's response is concerning. She's getting ""offended and angry and pissed off"" when told she can't perform unwanted physical acts on her partner's body. Her argument that ""all relationships have sacrifices"" and that he should sacrifice his bodily comfort for her enjoyment is problematic. She's treating his body as if she has some inherent right to it for her satisfaction.

While I can understand that this might be a compulsive behavior for her, having a compulsion doesn't give someone the right to override their partner's bodily autonomy. The author has legitimate medical and comfort reasons for not wanting this to continue, especially given his worsening breakouts from medication.

The author acknowledges several key points:
1. They can't tell if the initial contact was intentional or accidental

3. The other person was ""unable to defend himself"" during the stomping

Even if the initial contact was intentional (which is uncertain), the author's response was grossly disproportionate. Going from what might have been a light punch or accidental contact to throwing someone to the ground and repeatedly stomping on their face represents a massive escalation that goes far beyond reasonable self-defense. The author continued the attack even when the person was defenseless on the ground.

The author's reflection shows they understand the severity of their actions, yet they seem to be seeking validation rather than taking full responsibility. The fact that they're questioning whether people calling them out are just ""hippie dippy types"" suggests some deflection of accountability.

The author works full-time (sometimes 7 days a week) and expects his wife to handle all housework while she's a stay-at-home parent caring for their son. However, there are some concerning elements here:

While traditional divisions of labor can work when both partners agree, the author's complete refusal to participate in household maintenance, even when it's clearly becoming unmanageable, suggests an inflexible and unsupportive approach.

The author has legitimate reasons for not posting frequently on social media - they genuinely rarely post (only twice in a year) and have philosophical concerns about relationship posts. They also did acknowledge the girlfriend publicly through an Instagram story, showing they weren't trying to hide the relationship.

However, the girlfriend's feelings are also understandable. Social media presence can feel important for relationship validation to many people, and she may have interpreted the lack of posts as a sign of lesser commitment or importance.

The real issue seems to be that neither person fully understood or validated the other's perspective.

The author made what appears to be a practical clothing choice for hot weather - switching to a lighter undershirt under his leather jacket. While this inadvertently drew attention to his physique, there's no indication he intended this outcome or encouraged the inappropriate touching from others. In fact, he actively stepped back when people touched him inappropriately, showing respect for boundaries.

The girlfriend's concerns about the revealing nature of his outfit are understandable - she may have felt uncomfortable with the attention he was receiving. However, her response was problematic in several ways:
- She stormed off without clearly communicating her concerns initially
- When he tried to apologize and offered to go home and change, she escalated with name-calling (""inconsiderate asshole"")
- She made sarcastic comments rather than having a constructive conversation
- She suggested he should ""go for her friends instead,"" which seems manipulative
- She left the party entirely rather than working through the issue

The author showed willingness to apologize, offered to change clothes, and tried to reason with her. While he could have been more thoughtful about his clothing choice initially, his response to the situation was appropriate and considerate.

The 26F made a comment that was clearly insensitive and inappropriate given the context - joking about using someone's death as an excuse and being flippant about a beloved community member who had just passed away. This affected multiple people in the group who were grieving and showed respect for the deceased person.

The author's response (""Wow, kind of harsh, but okay"") was relatively mild and measured. They didn't attack the person or escalate the situation dramatically - they simply pointed out that the comment was inappropriate, which it objectively was. The fact that others in the circle seemed uncomfortable suggests the author was reflecting the group's sentiment.

While people do grieve differently and some use humor as a coping mechanism, there's a difference between private coping humor and making public jokes that diminish someone's death and suggest manipulating it for personal gain. The author mentions this isn't the first inappropriate comment, suggesting a pattern rather than just awkward grief processing.

The author showed restraint in their response and was standing up for the memory of someone important to their community. Their reaction was proportionate to the situation.

The author is asking for a reasonable financial contribution to shared living expenses, offering flexible options including reduced rent ($300-350 vs $700 in loans), percentage-based payments, or non-monetary contributions through household work. These are all fair approaches to sharing living costs.

The boyfriend, however, refuses all proposed solutions - won't pay any rent, won't contribute through household work (calling it ""slavery""), and becomes angry and emotionally manipulative when disagreed with, claiming the author doesn't love him. While his financial stress from student loans is understandable, his complete unwillingness to contribute anything and his hostile reaction to reasonable requests is problematic.

The author's position of ""if you can't afford to live with me, then don't"" is practical and fair. Living together requires shared financial responsibility, and the author has already shown flexibility in trying to accommodate his situation.

The boyfriend's refusal to accept any form of contribution while still wanting to live together, combined with his angry and manipulative responses, makes him primarily at fault for this conflict.

Your boyfriend did make an effort to offer support - he helped sell your ticket when you decided not to go, offered to stay with you 30 minutes before leaving, and reached out again the next day. However, I can see why the timing of his first offer felt insufficient given the magnitude of your loss.

The key issue here seems to be a communication breakdown. You didn't respond to his offer or explicitly ask him to stay, while he may have interpreted your silence as you wanting space to grieve. Neither of you clearly communicated your needs and expectations during an emotionally charged time.

While it's natural to want your partner to intuitively know you need them during grief, people process and respond to crisis situations differently. Some assume others want space, others assume they want company. Without clear communication, misunderstandings happen.

Your feelings are completely valid - losing a grandmother is devastating and wanting support is normal. But holding anger toward someone who did attempt to offer support (even if the timing felt wrong) during your mutual miscommunication seems unproductive for your relationship and healing.

The author helped a mentally challenged person hide from their caregivers, which interfered with legitimate efforts to ensure her safety and wellbeing. While the author's stated motivation was selfish (seeking personal purpose rather than genuine concern for the girl), the core issue is that they prevented a vulnerable person from receiving proper care and supervision.

Mental health caregivers and family members have legal and ethical responsibilities for the wellbeing of individuals who may not be able to make fully informed decisions about their safety. By helping her hide, the author:
- Interfered with legitimate care arrangements
- Potentially put a vulnerable person at risk
- Involved innocent friends who faced consequences
- Created unnecessary distress for the caregivers and family

The author seems to recognize their motivations were problematic (""my reasons weren't right"") and acknowledges causing trouble for multiple people. While helping someone in distress can seem compassionate, in this case it appears to have been misguided and potentially harmful.

The girl's situation as someone who ""ran away"" suggests there may have been underlying issues, but the appropriate response would have been to contact proper authorities or social services, not to help her hide from her caregivers.

However, your response crossed a clear line. You brought up his personal relationship and infidelity in a public group chat, which was a deliberate attempt to humiliate him in front of your classmates. While his cheating on your friend was wrong, exposing someone's private relationship issues in a group setting is cruel and goes beyond defending yourself from his academic threat.

Both of you escalated the situation unnecessarily - he turned a minor homework sharing request into a threat against your academic standing, and you retaliated by publicly shaming him about his personal life. Two wrongs don't make a right, and both actions caused harm to the other person.

The ex-boyfriend was clearly problematic - he was a pathological liar, manipulative, financially exploitative, and a cheater who gaslit the author when confronted with evidence. His behavior was consistently harmful and dishonest throughout the relationship.

The author has legitimate concerns about hygiene - it's reasonable to expect basic cleanliness from a partner, and it would be embarrassing to go out with someone who has noticeable body odor. However, his approach is problematic. The ""performance"" of asking if he smells first, then asking if she smells, comes across as condescending rather than caring. Continuing to bring up the smell multiple times throughout the day (""banging on about it"") was excessive and hurtful. Calling the situation ""ridiculous"" during an emotional moment was insensitive and escalated the conflict.

The girlfriend also bears responsibility here. At 29, basic hygiene should be automatic, and repeatedly needing reminders about showering, teeth brushing, and clean clothes suggests she's not taking reasonable care of herself. Her communication style of giving one-word answers and refusing to discuss the issue constructively (""leave it"") is unhelpful and immature. However, her feelings of embarrassment and hurt are understandable given how the situation was handled.

The author has clearly communicated their mental health needs and past traumatic roommate experiences that resulted in nightmares and significant distress. They've offered a reasonable compromise - paying the full rent for both rooms to live alone. As a professional student with an extremely demanding workload, their request for a stable living environment is entirely reasonable.

The parents' approach is problematic in several ways:
- They're dismissing legitimate mental health concerns and calling their child ""dramatic""
- They refuse to even listen to the author's perspective 
- They made an investment decision (buying a two-bedroom for better returns) but are trying to force their child to accommodate that business decision
- Their suggestion that eviction is a simple solution shows they don't understand the stress and disruption that would cause

While the parents may have good intentions about keeping rent money in the family and making a sound investment, they're prioritizing financial considerations over their child's wellbeing during a critical period in their education.

The teacher's behavior appears problematic - falsely accusing you of phone use when you weren't, sending you to the office despite your clear demonstration of innocence, making unfounded accusations about hand signals, and generally creating a hostile classroom environment. Even grief doesn't justify treating students unfairly or making false accusations.

However, creating and maintaining a meme page specifically targeting your teacher crosses an ethical line. While you frame it as ""just jokes,"" publicly mocking a teacher online can constitute cyberbullying and harassment. The fact that you felt guilty upon learning about her husband's death suggests you recognized this was potentially harmful. Your decision to continue the page after learning about her personal tragedy, despite feeling that guilt, makes this more concerning.

The teacher's poor classroom management and unfair treatment of students is wrong, but responding with public ridicule rather than proper channels (administration, parents, etc.) is also inappropriate. Two wrongs don't make a right.

Both parties have contributed to this toxic dynamic - the teacher through unprofessional conduct and you through cyberbullying behavior, even if unintended.

One of them has to be crated because he gets anxiety and likes to chew on...,Author,Author,0.85,0.625,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the behavior of both the dogs and the owner.

The dogs are displaying natural instincts - digging is completely normal canine behavior, especially when the ground is soft from rain. They're not acting out of malice or deliberately trying to cause problems. The fact that they dig in a spot ""outside of view"" is likely coincidental rather than intentionally deceptive behavior.

However, the owner's response is problematic. Yelling at dogs and confining them overnight in crates as punishment is not effective training and can increase anxiety and behavioral issues. This approach doesn't address the root cause (natural digging instinct) and may actually worsen the problem. Better solutions would include providing appropriate digging areas, increasing exercise/mental stimulation, or using positive reinforcement training methods.

The owner acknowledges the dogs are ""following instinct"" but continues using punishment-based methods that aren't working. While the frustration is understandable, the chosen response is counterproductive.

The dogs are simply being dogs, while the human is using ineffective and potentially harmful training methods despite recognizing the behavior is instinctual.

When you heard what sounded like gunshots, you responsibly moved away from that area and found a safe spot to wait things out.

You're being considerate by:
- Taking smoke breaks outside to avoid bothering your parents
- Properly disposing of cigarette butts

Using public sidewalks at any hour for lawful activities like walking is perfectly legal and reasonable. While it may be less common in suburban areas compared to cities, you're not doing anything wrong or inconsiderate.

The author has repeatedly:
- Ghosted this person when things got difficult

- Broken up with her multiple times when he ""wasn't ready""
- Used her emotional investment and physical intimacy (she gave up her virginity to him after he cheated and they reconciled)

The other person has been consistently understanding, accommodating, and honest about her boundaries. She ended her previous relationship to avoid cheating, was willing to work through issues, and even compromised her values around intimacy. She handled the breakups maturely despite being hurt.

The author shows a pattern of selfishness and emotional immaturity - pursuing this person when convenient, discarding the relationship when it requires effort or commitment, then returning when he misses the benefits. His question about trying ""again (again)"" suggests he hasn't fully grasped how harmful this cycle has been to her.

The girlfriend's disappointment is understandable - she spent a weekend in cold rain trying to catch her absolute favorite Pokémon and failed, while watching her partner succeed repeatedly and celebrate each success. Her emotional reaction, while intense, seems genuine given the context and her investment in the game.

The key issue is the author's response to his girlfriend's distress. When she explained that his celebratory dancing felt hurtful given her repeated bad luck, and when she drew a comparison to her willingness to sacrifice her single shiny Gengar for him, he dismissed her feelings as ""childish"" rather than showing empathy. The fact that she explicitly said she didn't feel entitled to his Bulbasaur but was disappointed by the contrast in their approaches suggests she was trying to communicate about their relationship dynamics, not just the game.

While the author has every right to keep his Pokémon, his dismissive attitude toward his girlfriend's feelings and his failure to recognize how his behavior might have been insensitive (even if unintentionally) makes him primarily at fault for how this situation escalated.

The author asked their cousin for a favor (picking something up) when the cousin came by for his charger. The cousin agreed to help. However, there was clearly a miscommunication about timing - the author expected advance notice of when the cousin would arrive, while the cousin apparently assumed the author would be available since they were doing a requested favor.

The author's decision to ignore the doorbell and multiple phone calls during a video game, even when doing so meant leaving someone who was helping them standing outside, shows poor prioritization. A video game, regardless of how ""heated"" it was, shouldn't take precedence over someone doing you a favor. The multiple phone calls should have been a clear signal that this wasn't just a delivery.

However, the cousin's reaction - posting about it on social media and deleting the author as a friend - seems disproportionate for what appears to be a first-time miscommunication between people who are ""pretty close.""

The girlfriend disclosed something personal from her past that occurred before they were dating - signing up for sugar baby websites when she needed money for travel. She was honest about this experience and claims she never sent photos.

The author's reaction was to immediately judge her character and question her ""self-respect,"" which caused her to cry. While he later apologized, he continues to obsess over assumptions about what she might have done, despite her denials.

The key issues here are:

These are valid practical considerations for a potluck gathering.

However, the author's approach and language are problematic. Using extremely harsh terms like ""total fucking slob,"" ""literally disgusting,"" ""my family is trash"" shows a lack of empathy and understanding. A household with 7 people including 4 young children faces significant challenges in maintaining cleanliness, and this situation may reflect overwhelm, different standards, or other circumstances rather than laziness.

The desire for basic cleanliness for a food-related gathering is reasonable, but demanding that the sister clean up the entire house could come across as judgmental and controlling, especially given the harsh internal attitude expressed.

The author has legitimate feelings about Christmas decorating being tied to precious childhood memories with both parents together. It's completely understandable that recreating this tradition with mom's new fiancé would feel emotionally difficult and like it's diminishing those special memories. The author was honest about their feelings and initially set a reasonable boundary.

However, the mother also has understandable desires to create new traditions and include her child in holiday celebrations with her new partner. Her disappointment is natural, even if her passive-aggressive response wasn't ideal.

The key issue is how both parties handled the conflict. The mother used manipulative tactics (passive-aggression, false claims about living arrangements) to pressure her child into compliance. The author, while having valid feelings, ultimately agreed to help but then made the experience unpleasant for everyone by being visibly upset throughout.

Both could have handled this better - the mother by respecting boundaries and communicating directly rather than manipulatively, and the author by either maintaining their boundary or, if choosing to help, making a genuine effort to be civil during the activity.

The author describes a pattern of bullying from their older sister over years, followed by her return to the household creating ongoing tension. In the specific incident, the sister initiated physical violence by swinging at the author first, then continued to attack when he stepped back. The author's response was to restrain her rather than strike back, which shows some restraint given the circumstances.

However, there are concerning elements: the author admits to pulling hair during the restraint and screaming at his sister to ""go die,"" which escalates beyond necessary self-defense. The situation also involves family dysfunction where proper conflict resolution mechanisms seem absent.

While the sister clearly initiated the physical confrontation and the author had a right to defend himself, his response went somewhat beyond pure self-defense into retaliation territory. The family environment appears toxic with poor communication and conflict resolution from all parties involved.

The father's reaction of only blaming the author without addressing the sister's initiation of violence also shows poor judgment, but the core conflict was between the siblings.

They discussed this with their husband, who agreed it was excessive, and then set reasonable boundaries with the sister-in-law.

The sister-in-law and family appear to have made assumptions about the author's availability based solely on their employment status, without considering that the author might have their own plans, needs, or preferences. Expecting someone to be an ""on demand"" babysitter every other day with minimal notice, regardless of their work status, is unreasonable. The family's reaction - calling the author ""lazy"" for not wanting to provide free childcare - shows they feel entitled to the author's time and labor.

While I can sympathize with a struggling single mother's need for childcare support, that doesn't create an obligation for extended family members to provide unlimited free babysitting services. The author was willing to help in emergencies but reasonably declined to be the default childcare solution.

Only months later did she reveal it was actually sexual assault, not consensual cheating.

While I have deep sympathy for what the ex went through if she was indeed assaulted, several factors are important here:

The author jumped to conclusions based on an Instagram post without verifying the facts first. When they confronted their friend ""half joking half hurt,"" they were essentially accusing her of lying about her birthday plans. The friend explained it was an old picture and she had been with her mom as originally stated. The friend's advice to ""ask her next time instead of jumping to getting mad"" was reasonable - she was asking for the benefit of the doubt before being confronted.

However, the author mentions this is a pattern (""literally every holiday and every birthday"") where they feel excluded or misled, to the point their husband has noticed their repeated upset. This suggests there may be ongoing issues in the friendship dynamic.

While the friend could have been more understanding of why the author might feel sensitive given past experiences, the immediate fault lies with the author for making accusations based on assumptions rather than seeking clarification first. The author even acknowledges feeling ""really stupid"" about their reaction.

The core issue here is the author's approach to handling their insecurities and assumptions about their friend's behavior.

I ...,Other,Other,0.85,0.6666666666666666,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the actions and reasonableness of both parties.

The author (17M) did cancel very last minute - only 1 hour before the scheduled meeting. This is definitely inconsiderate and inconvenient for the seller, especially since the seller had made efforts like lowering the price and arranging express shipping. However, the author's reason for canceling was legitimate (no longer needed the item due to a friend's offer), and he did apologize sincerely multiple times.

The seller's reaction, while understandably frustrated initially, quickly escalated to completely inappropriate behavior. Threatening to ""expose"" someone on Facebook, making threats about making them ""famous"" in a negative way, and saving their picture with implied malicious intent crosses well beyond reasonable frustration into harassment and potentially threatening behavior.

The author made a mistake with poor timing, but the seller's response was disproportionate and inappropriate. The author handled the situation as well as could be expected for a 17-year-old in an uncomfortable situation - he apologized genuinely and repeatedly.

While the author bears some responsibility for the late cancellation, the seller's threatening behavior is the more serious issue here.

The other people are clearly at fault for repeatedly giving out an email address that isn't theirs. This is careless and inconsiderate behavior that has persisted for 13 years despite the author's initial attempts to resolve it politely. They're creating the core problem through their negligence.

However, the author's response has escalated far beyond reasonable boundaries. While the frustration is understandable, cancelling other people's travel reservations, medical appointments, sending hostile emails to their colleagues, and ordering unwanted items to their homes crosses into harassment territory. These actions could cause significant financial harm, missed medical care, professional damage, and constitute what could be considered cyberstalking or fraud in many jurisdictions.

The author had other options available - such as setting up email filters, contacting Gmail support, or simply ignoring/deleting the emails. The decision to actively interfere with other people's lives, potentially causing them real harm, makes this behavior problematic regardless of the initial provocation.

Both parties are engaging in problematic behavior - the others through persistent carelessness, and the author through deliberate retaliation that has become disproportionate and potentially illegal.

She's a huge romantic, gave me a lot of presents...",Author,Author,0.85,0.631578947368421,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the author's actions and motivations carefully.

The author entered into and continued a romantic relationship for months despite having no physical attraction or romantic feelings for this person. They accepted romantic gestures and gifts while knowing they didn't reciprocate those feelings. When ending the relationship, they chose to lie about the reasons rather than being honest (though tactful).

While the author's concern about not wanting to hurt her feelings is understandable, the core issue is that they knowingly led someone on for months. This caused significantly more harm than being honest earlier would have. The woman invested emotionally, gave gifts, made romantic gestures, and developed deeper feelings - all while the author knew they weren't genuinely interested.

The lie about moving away, while seemingly kinder in the moment, actually made things worse by giving her false hope about the relationship's potential and preventing her from getting proper closure.

The author acknowledges feeling guilty and recognizes they ""led her on out of guilt,"" which shows awareness that their actions were problematic. However, good intentions don't negate the harm caused by the deception.

The woman appears to have acted in good faith throughout - she was genuine in her feelings and gestures, and there's no indication she did anything wrong.

She has always made Western food such as...,Author,Author,0.8,0.9259259259259259,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the dynamics and communication between both parties.

The author's initial suggestion for his wife to cook food from her cultural background isn't inherently problematic - it came from appreciation of the delicious meals at her family's house. However, several issues emerge:

1. When she explained she doesn't know how to cook those dishes (her parents never taught her), he persisted rather than accepting her explanation
2. He made assumptions about what she ""should"" do with ""her culture"" 
3. His response about being ""super white"" when she suggested he learn to cook those dishes himself shows he's applying a double standard
4. He's essentially asking her to take on the labor of learning entirely new cooking skills for his benefit

The wife's response was direct but reasonable - if he wants those foods, he can learn to make them himself. Her pointing out this option shows the author could solve this himself rather than expecting her to do it.

While the author's appreciation for the cuisine is understandable, his persistence after her explanation and his unwillingness to learn these dishes himself while expecting her to do so makes him primarily at fault for the conflict.

The wife could have been more diplomatic in her response, but she was essentially defending reasonable boundaries about her time and labor.

The author made an unwelcome sexual advance while intoxicated, which their partner clearly communicated was triggering given both are sexual assault survivors. The author appropriately stopped when asked and apologized multiple times. However, the author's subsequent behavior and internal reactions are concerning.

The key issues are:
1. The author became frustrated with their partner's processing of a triggering event
2. They questioned their partner's reaction and suspected manipulation
3. They threatened to withdraw support in other areas of the relationship as retaliation
4. They prioritized their own convenience (transportation preferences) over supporting their partner through trauma processing

While the initial incident was a mistake that the author handled appropriately with apologies, their response the next morning shows a lack of understanding about trauma responses and appropriate support. The author admits to feeling ""retaliatory"" and considering withdrawing emotional support, which suggests they're more focused on their own discomfort than their partner's wellbeing.

The partner's reaction - being withdrawn, having flat affect, and needing time to process - are normal trauma responses. The author's suspicion that this is manipulation to return to an ""unequal dynamic"" reveals concerning attitudes about their partner's needs and trauma.

The author is primarily at fault for their poor handling of the aftermath, even though the initial boundary crossing appears to have been unintentional.

Your mother:
- Dismissed your reports of physical abuse from your nanny
- Explicitly stated she didn't care about your social life, only your grades
- Used your experiences with bullying as ongoing jokes
- Forgets important details about your life while remembering trivial details about your sister's
- Uses your personal stories against you (weaponizing your dating experiences)

- Refuses to respect your boundaries around communication styles

You have every right to control what you share and with whom. The fact that you're her child doesn't give her unlimited access to your private thoughts and feelings, especially when she has repeatedly demonstrated that she will misuse that information or dismiss your concerns.

161,I (24M) and my girlfriend (24F) re-homed a dog about a year ago from someone in the same city we live in. The previous owner was unable to keep taking care of him and needed to find him a new home. Ye...,Nobody,Author,0.75,0.5,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the dynamics of pet rehoming and the reasonable expectations of all parties involved.

When someone rehomes a pet, there's typically an understanding that they're transferring ownership and responsibility permanently. The previous owner made the difficult decision to give up the dog because they couldn't care for him properly. After a full year, the dog has bonded with his new family and established a new life.

While the previous owner's desire to see the dog again is understandable and comes from a place of care, requesting to take the dog for walks crosses appropriate boundaries. This could be confusing for the dog and creates an awkward ongoing relationship that most new pet owners wouldn't be comfortable with.

However, lying about being out of town wasn't the best approach. A honest but kind conversation explaining that they prefer to keep clean boundaries after the rehoming would have been more appropriate. The previous owner deserved a respectful response rather than deception.

The current owners' concerns about the previous owner potentially wanting the dog back aren't entirely unreasonable - this kind of contact after rehoming can sometimes lead to complications or attempts to reclaim pets.

While the lying was problematic, the underlying desire to maintain boundaries after a pet rehoming is reasonable and understandable.

The boyfriend is primarily at fault here. His behavior shows several concerning patterns:
- He becomes moody and rude when tired, creating a no-win situation for his partner
- He gives insincere apologies (""sorry"" but doesn't sound like he means it)
- He responds with ""I don't care"" when asked about intimacy and connection
- He makes personal attacks about her not exercising when she tries to communicate her feelings
- He throws her staying (at his request) back in her face during the argument
- He mischaracterizes her expressing loneliness as complaining or demanding he wake up

The author tried to be considerate by not waking him, doing helpful things like charging his phone and filling his water bottle, and clearly communicating that she wasn't angry about him sleeping but just felt lonely and bored. When he asked what was wrong, she answered honestly.

However, the author could have handled some things better - perhaps suggesting they reschedule when he first lay down, or being more direct about her needs earlier in the evening.

The relationship dynamics described (walking on eggshells around his moods, him being selectively complimentary about her body, recent rocky periods) suggest deeper issues that both parties need to address.

The author seems to have difficulty accepting boundaries and responsibility. When H became less available due to college commitments, the author took this personally rather than understanding that friendships naturally evolve. The author also appears to minimize their own behavior - calling H a ""selfish bitch"" over transportation issues, then dismissing H's concerns about financial boundaries as trivial ($50-60 ""only"").

Most telling is that when the author sought outside perspective, a mutual friend agreed with H, suggesting this isn't just H being unreasonable. The author's response to H declining to be maid of honor - immediately seeking validation rather than reflecting on H's specific concerns about feeling taken advantage of - also suggests a pattern of self-focus.

H's concerns about the author ""taking advantage"" and ""only focusing on yourself and your own problems"" appear to have merit based on the author's own account. While H could have communicated more diplomatically at times, setting boundaries around time, money, and emotional energy in a friendship is reasonable.

The author's traumatic background explains some of these patterns but doesn't excuse dismissing a friend's legitimate concerns or the inability to maintain reciprocal relationships.

The author has actually handled this situation quite well so far. They've been transparent with Joey about their feelings, shared crucial information that Monica isn't interested in him, encouraged Joey to have the necessary conversation with Monica, and even gave him an ultimatum with a deadline. The author has been trying to balance loyalty to their friend with their own romantic interests.

Joey is in denial and refusing to face reality despite being given clear information. His continued pursuit of someone who isn't interested (information he now has) and his refusal to have an honest conversation is problematic.

Monica has been ""stringing Joey along"" by her own admission, going on dates while knowing she's not interested and waiting for him to confess so she can reject him. This is unfair to Joey.

However, the author did fail to follow through on their ultimatum, which undermines their credibility and prolongs everyone's suffering. At this point, continuing to wait indefinitely while Joey remains in denial isn't helping anyone - not Joey (who needs closure), not Monica (who's stuck in an awkward situation), and not the author (who's putting their life on hold).

The author has done more than enough to be considerate of Joey's feelings. Sometimes being a good friend means allowing someone to face the consequences of their inaction rather than enabling their avoidance indefinitely.

The author had legitimate challenges (illness, finals) but also made some questionable decisions. They joined a group late, were unavailable during a crucial week, and then faced additional obstacles with illness and competing finals. However, they did communicate their limitations and offered to do what they could.

The group members, particularly the one who sent the harsh 2am message, handled the situation poorly. While their frustration about workload distribution may have been understandable, the aggressive communication (""I never wanted you to join the group in the first place"") and dismissive attitude toward the author's circumstances was inappropriate and unprofessional.

However, both sides contributed to this conflict. The author could have been more proactive in managing their commitments and perhaps shouldn't have joined a group so late in the process when they knew they had a busy schedule. The group members could have communicated their concerns more constructively and worked together to find solutions rather than creating ultimatums and hostile exchanges.

The author was using Tinder primarily for entertainment/casual browsing, matched with someone who super-liked them, had friendly conversations about common interests, and then disclosed their relationship status and uncertainty about dating when things ""got too real"" (when he asked for their number). The guy responded that he wasn't looking for anything particular either, suggesting he was fine with the situation.

The author did disclose their situation before things progressed beyond casual conversation, and the other person seemed accepting of it. The author wasn't actively misleading anyone or making promises they couldn't keep.

However, there is some validity to the friend's point that being more upfront in the profile could prevent misunderstandings, since most people on Tinder do have dating/romantic expectations.

You were disrespectful in how you handled the disagreement - angrily asserting your independence, calling in sick against your father's wishes while he was present, and especially telling him to ""shut the fuck up."" Even acknowledging you ""probably did not sound as mature as it seems,"" this was clearly disrespectful behavior toward your parent.

While parents may reasonably expect respect and have authority over school attendance decisions, grabbing you by the throat was physical intimidation that went far beyond appropriate discipline. Name-calling (""spoiled middleclass brat,"" ""weak"") was also unnecessarily harsh and escalatory.

The fact that you were able to attend school suggests you may not have been as sick as initially thought, which somewhat validates your father's concern about the absence. However, this doesn't justify his physical response.

However, completely ghosting someone who considers you a friend, without any conversation about the issue, is quite harsh.

There are middle-ground approaches you could take - like setting boundaries about when you're available to talk, being direct about needing space during finals, or having an honest conversation about communication styles.

That said, your mental health and academic success are legitimate priorities, and you're not obligated to be someone's emotional support system at your own expense, especially when they're not communicating in a healthy way.

The author appears to have had a long-standing plan to move in with their friend, but circumstances changed when the friend got into a relationship. The author is being asked to help their friend qualify for an apartment (by staying on the lease) while the friend plans to have her boyfriend move in instead, with the author potentially joining later in what would be an awkward three-person living situation.

The friend seems to be prioritizing her new relationship over previous commitments and is asking the author to take on financial responsibility and risk (being on a lease) to facilitate her living situation with someone who can't qualify due to probation status.

However, the author does seem to have some unreasonable expectations about controlling their friend's relationship choices and timeline. The comment about the boyfriend not ""properly"" asking to be in a relationship shows some judgment about matters that aren't really their business.

That said, the core issue is about honesty, consideration, and fairness in housing arrangements and financial commitments. The friend is asking for a significant favor while not being upfront about her full intentions, and is putting the author in a potentially uncomfortable and financially risky position.

The author is a 20-year-old in recovery who has discovered a meaningful career path that aligns with her values and makes her genuinely happy. She's been accepted to medical schools but realizes she doesn't actually want to be a doctor - these were her father's dreams, not her own. She's seeking to make an independent life decision about her career and future.

The father, while likely coming from a place of love and concern, is responding in a deeply problematic way. He's being ""absolutely livid,"" calling her an ""idiot & an asshole,"" telling her she's ""disappointing everyone,"" and threatening that she'll ""end up dying in the street addicted to drugs"" without following his plan.

The older couple's reaction was understandable - they saw someone pointing a phone in their direction and reasonably assumed they were being photographed without consent, which would make most people uncomfortable. Their decision to leave was a reasonable response to feeling violated.

However, this appears to be primarily a misunderstanding. The couple made an incorrect assumption about being the target of the photo, but their assumption was reasonable given the circumstances. The author and boyfriend were careless about how their actions might be perceived but weren't intentionally trying to make anyone uncomfortable.

The core issue is that taking photos of strangers in restaurants, even with innocent intent, creates an environment where misunderstandings like this can easily occur. The author and boyfriend should have been more mindful of how their behavior might affect other diners.

This seems like a situation where better communication or more discrete behavior could have prevented the problem entirely.

He was clean when I met and marrie...,Other,Other,0.85,0.9230769230769231,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to evaluate the core issue: a parent setting boundaries to protect their child from exposure to drug-related situations and unpredictable behavior.

The author established a clear, reasonable boundary - no unsupervised visits while there's risk of the child being exposed to the brother-in-law's addiction or related drama. This boundary was violated multiple times:

1. The gas station incident where the 6-year-old witnessed a confrontation involving the addicted uncle, causing the child distress
2. The restaurant/mall incident where the mother-in-law misrepresented the supervision arrangement

The mother-in-law has demonstrated she cannot be trusted to maintain these boundaries, prioritizing her relationship with her addicted son over the safety and wellbeing of her granddaughter. The author's concerns are validated by the child's own reactions - expressing that something ""made her belly hurt"" and later hiding from the grandparents during visits.

The author is not preventing all contact - they still visit weekly as a family. The restriction is specifically about unsupervised time, which is a reasonable precaution given the documented pattern of boundary violations and the unpredictable nature of addiction-related situations.

While the husband's position is understandable (wanting his parents to have a relationship with their granddaughter), his failure to consistently support the agreed-upon boundaries undermines child safety.

The author is acting as a responsible parent protecting their child from potentially harmful situations.

3. Staying in the room with the door wide open, exposing the author to others

The author has tried reasoning with them and only resorts to yelling when their basic right to privacy while changing clothes is being violated.

The author expressed discomfort with their 14-year-old sister wearing a bikini, citing concerns about appropriateness for her age. While the author may have had protective intentions, commenting on what their sister should or shouldn't wear based on ""showing too much skin"" does come across as controlling her bodily autonomy and potentially body-shaming, even if unintentional.

The dad's girlfriend responded defensively, calling the author sexist and accusing them of body shaming. While her reaction was harsh, she was defending the sister's right to choose her own clothing.

The sister was simply trying on swimwear - completely normal behavior when shopping for a family trip.

The core issue seems to be the author imposing their personal comfort level and views about ""appropriateness"" on their sister's clothing choices. Bikinis are standard, widely-accepted swimwear for teenagers, and the sister wasn't doing anything inappropriate by trying them on or considering wearing them.

The author's comment, while possibly well-intentioned, was inappropriate as it attempted to police their sister's clothing based on subjective standards about what's ""appropriate"" for her age and body.

   - It can attract animals to roadsides, creating safety hazards
   - Decomposition timing varies greatly by climate and can create unsightly conditions

The author explicitly promised to stop using porn as a condition for the relationship to begin. His girlfriend was upfront about this being a dealbreaker due to her traumatic experience with revenge porn. He agreed to this boundary, which allowed the relationship to move forward from friends-with-benefits to dating.

However, the author then deliberately broke this promise while assuming his girlfriend ""wouldn't know"" and justifying it wouldn't ""impact the relationship."" This shows a fundamental misunderstanding - the impact isn't just about whether she finds out, but about honoring the commitment he made. He also dismisses her trauma-based concerns as ""ridiculous"" and ""stupid.""

While people can have different views on porn use in relationships, what matters here is that he made a specific commitment he had no intention of keeping, then violated her trust and minimizes her feelings when confronted.

The girlfriend set a clear boundary based on personal trauma, was honest about it upfront, and gave him the choice to accept or decline. She's not at fault for having this boundary or for being upset when it was violated.

However, they accepted responsibility and agreed to replace it, which shows good faith. They offered reasonable solutions: paying in installments from their paycheck or saving up to buy a replacement in 7-8 months. They also offered their own phone as an immediate replacement, which the cousin refused.

The cousin is escalating the situation by demanding an expensive upgrade (iPhone X instead of equivalent iPhone 7 Plus), involving parents and creating family tension, and trying to force the author's parents to guarantee payments.

- Offering to pay the actual market value of the lost phone

The author's girlfriend has legitimate concerns given the history between the author and his female friend - they made out twice in the past, including while both were in other relationships (cheating). Even though the author claims the friendship is now platonic, the girlfriend's discomfort is understandable given this romantic/sexual history.

However, the author also has valid points. He's maintained this friendship for 10 years, the romantic incidents were 2 years ago, and he's been transparent about the sleepover arrangement. The practical need (avoiding a long commute for an early meeting) seems genuine, and he offered his couch, not his bed.

The girlfriend's anger, while understandable, seems somewhat disproportionate if she's generally okay with other friends staying over. Her dislike of this specific friend appears to be the main issue rather than the act itself.

The author could have been more sensitive to his girlfriend's feelings about this particular friend and perhaps discussed it more thoroughly beforehand or found alternative solutions. But his actions don't seem malicious or deliberately boundary-crossing.

The mother's behavior was clearly problematic - asking invasive questions about racial preferences to a guest, using language like ""what color of boys do you like,"" and then doubling down when called out. Her pattern of fetishizing people of color and treating them as novelties is concerning, regardless of her background or recovery status.

The author attempted to address this diplomatically, first with humor, then with patient explanation. When the situation escalated, they tried to de-escalate and eventually ended the argument when it became unproductive. They showed awareness of the complexity - understanding their mother's limitations while still recognizing the impact on others.

While the author questions whether they could have handled it better, their approach was measured and appropriate given the circumstances. They protected a guest from uncomfortable treatment while trying to educate their mother constructively. The brother's more direct approach, while perhaps tactless in front of the friend, wasn't wrong either - someone needed to clearly name the problematic behavior.

The author and their husband have been planning their son's first birthday celebration for months, involving significant expense (international flights) and using all of the husband's work leave specifically for this milestone. They were already planning a family reunion-style celebration for their side of the family.

The cousin then approached them asking to combine the parties at her parents' house, essentially asking the author to give up their planned celebration and make their son's first birthday secondary to her daughter's party (offering just a ""smash cake so he didn't feel left out"" suggests the son would be an afterthought).

While the cousin may have had good intentions about bringing family together, she's asking the author to sacrifice their carefully planned celebration without seeming to fully consider the significance of what she's requesting. A first birthday is a major milestone for new parents, and the author has every right to want their son to have his own special day, especially given the effort and expense they're putting into traveling for it.

The author is concerned about exposing their future vaccinated child to unvaccinated cousins. This is actually a medically sound concern for several reasons:

1. Vaccines aren't 100% effective - even vaccinated children can contract diseases, though usually with milder symptoms
2. Infants aren't fully vaccinated until around 12-18 months, leaving a vulnerable window
3. Some vaccines require multiple doses over time to build full immunity
4. Unvaccinated individuals pose a genuine public health risk to vulnerable populations

The author's parents are dismissing these legitimate medical concerns by suggesting vaccination alone provides complete protection, which isn't accurate. The author is making a reasonable parenting decision based on established medical guidance about protecting infants from preventable diseases.

While this decision may hurt family relationships, the author has the right and responsibility to make medical decisions they believe are in their child's best interest. The family members who chose not to vaccinate made their decision; the author is making theirs.

The author isn't being vindictive or unreasonable - they're applying standard medical precautions recommended by pediatricians. Their parents' dismissal of these valid concerns is problematic.

The author was clear and upfront about their limitations regarding the birthday celebration due to finals being just one week later. They communicated this well in advance, explained the high stakes of the exam, and offered an alternative plan (cake/card immediately, bigger celebration after exams). The girlfriend, being a medical student herself, explicitly agreed to this arrangement and said she understood.

However, when the birthday arrived, the girlfriend had a complete breakdown at midnight, revealing that birthdays were ""extremely important"" to her (information she had never shared before) and that she expected more than what was agreed upon. This suggests she either wasn't honest about her feelings during the initial conversation or changed her expectations without communicating this change.

The author did make an effort to remedy the situation immediately after learning about her distress, arranging flowers, dinner, cake, and presents despite being one week before their most important exam.

The core issue here is that the girlfriend agreed to one thing but expected another, and failed to communicate her true feelings about the importance of birthdays until it was too late.

The author is in a difficult position where they have legitimate concerns about living compatibility with their twin sister (they acknowledge they don't get along when living together long-term), and they value the current living atmosphere they've created. However, they also acknowledge that it's not more their house than hers - their mother is providing this opportunity equally to all the siblings.

The author isn't inherently wrong for having preferences about their living situation or for recognizing incompatible living styles.

The situation becomes more complex with the potential addition of the little sister, but that's a separate issue.

The author's intentions appear to have been good - trying to be supportive and reassuring about a sensitive topic her boyfriend had shared. However, bringing up someone's past trauma, even with good intentions, can be poorly timed or unwelcome, and the boyfriend clearly indicated he didn't want it discussed.

The author's mistake was ignoring him for days after he expressed discomfort, which escalated the conflict rather than addressing it constructively.

However, the boyfriend's response was significantly more problematic. After the author apologized, he remained ""pissy,"" then deliberately began flirting with other girls and being a bad boyfriend specifically to manipulate her into breaking up with him. This is emotionally manipulative behavior that shifts the burden of ending the relationship onto her while allowing him to avoid responsibility.

While the author made some missteps in communication and conflict resolution, the boyfriend's deliberate manipulation and refusal to communicate directly about relationship issues represents a more serious breach of healthy relationship conduct.

The author has a clear, consistent anxiety issue that affects their behavior with everyone - family, friends, romantic partners.

The elderly coworker's behavior was clearly inappropriate - repeatedly using the wrong name after corrections, making condescending comments, embarrassing you in front of customers and management, and mocking your personal choices. This pattern of disrespectful behavior created a hostile work environment.

However, shouting profanities in front of customers and other employees was unprofessional and inappropriate, regardless of the provocation. There were better ways to handle this situation, such as:
- Speaking to management about the ongoing harassment
- Having a private, firm conversation with the coworker
- Documenting the incidents
- Addressing it calmly but assertively in the moment

While the coworker's behavior was worse and more sustained, your explosive response in a customer-facing environment was also inappropriate and likely violated workplace conduct policies.

Both parties contributed to this situation escalating inappropriately, though the coworker bears more responsibility for creating the hostile environment that led to this outburst.

You had every right to refuse physical contact - that boundary is completely valid. However, the way you expressed it (""with the upmost disgust"" and ""Because we aren't friends!"") seems unnecessarily harsh for that particular moment. A simple ""I don't like hugs"" or ""Please don't touch me"" would have established the same boundary without the deliberate cruelty.

Your frustration with this person's past behavior is understandable, but using an unrelated moment to deliver that accumulated anger made the response disproportionate to the immediate situation. The goal should have been stopping unwanted contact, not inflicting emotional harm.

The ex-worker's other behaviors don't justify being needlessly mean in this specific interaction, even though your boundary itself was completely appropriate.

The author has a legitimate desire to see a band they enjoy again, especially when they have a work opportunity in London that coincides with the tour. Their reasoning that one experience shouldn't diminish another is logically sound, and they're being honest and upfront about their intentions rather than going behind their sister's back.

However, the sister has clearly communicated that this would hurt her deeply, even if she can't fully articulate why. Sometimes emotional responses aren't entirely logical, and the fact that their shared concert experience was meaningful to her (and was a Christmas gift) adds weight to her feelings.

The author acknowledges this is ""pretty unreasonable"" but also shows they care about their sister's feelings and don't want to ""poison that memory for her."" They're genuinely conflicted, which suggests they understand both perspectives.

While the sister's position may seem controlling, she's being honest about her emotional response rather than trying to manipulate through guilt or threats. She's simply stating how she would feel.

This appears to be a case where both people have understandable but conflicting needs - the author's reasonable desire for independence and enjoyment, versus the sister's emotional attachment to their shared experience. Neither person is being malicious or unreasonable enough to be ""at fault.""

The author made a significant mistake by blurting out that he still loved his ex during an intimate moment with someone else. This was hurtful and embarrassing for the woman involved. However, he did try to handle the aftermath responsibly by:
- Walking her home safely
- Apologizing immediately 
- Attempting to apologize again the next day
- Continuing to be cordial when seeing her

While his initial mistake was thoughtless and hurtful, it appears to have been an unintentional drunken slip rather than deliberate cruelty. His subsequent efforts to make amends seem genuine.

The woman's anger is completely understandable - being told someone loves their ex during intimacy would be deeply hurtful and humiliating. However, her continued passive-aggressive behavior after multiple sincere apologies seems excessive, especially since they were both single at the time and this was a hookup rather than a committed relationship.

The author made a mistake but tried to handle it maturely. The woman's initial anger was justified, but her prolonged hostile response after apologies seems disproportionate.

The author was contacted by someone making serious suicide threats, including claims of self-harm, photos of pills, and increasingly slurred speech suggesting potential overdose. The author spent hours trying to help, encouraged the person to call emergency services themselves, and only called police as a last resort when they genuinely believed someone's life was in danger.

The author followed reasonable escalation steps:
1. Attempted conversation and support
2. Encouraged the person to seek help themselves
3. Gave a warning before calling authorities
4. Called emergency services only when they believed it was a life-or-death situation

The timing was unfortunate - the person responded just before police arrived - but this doesn't make the author's decision wrong. When someone claims to have taken pills and their speech becomes slurred, waiting longer could have been fatal if the threat was real.

The police officers' dismissive attitude toward mental health crises and their lectures about taking suicide threats seriously are concerning and inappropriate. The author acted with genuine concern for human life and followed reasonable judgment.

The author had no way to verify the authenticity of the threat in real-time, and erring on the side of caution when someone's life might be at stake is the responsible choice. Better to have police respond to a false alarm than to ignore a real emergency.

The author has a legitimate medical need for this specific, expensive tea to manage digestive issues and pain. They have a limited supply that needs to last while away from home, making replacement impossible. When the step-mom offered the tea to the sister without asking, the author politely explained their medical need for it.

The step-mom's response was problematic - she dismissed the medical necessity and went on a rant about sharing, then called the author rude when they expressed being upset. While sharing is generally good in households, medical necessities should be treated differently than regular household items.

The author's response of minimal conversation after being called rude seems like a reasonable way to de-escalate rather than continuing the conflict. They didn't become aggressive or unreasonable.

The step-mom failed to recognize the difference between regular sharing and medical needs, dismissed the author's health concerns, and escalated the situation unnecessarily.

The author did show some clingy behavior by confronting her twice about response times after just a few weeks of chatting on a dating app. When someone's communication patterns change, it's usually a sign of decreased interest, and the mature response would be to either accept it gracefully or simply move on rather than demanding explanations.

However, the woman's reaction was extremely harsh and mean-spirited. While she had every right to be less interested or busy, calling someone ""an idiot"" and being deliberately cruel crosses a line. A simple ""I'm not feeling the connection"" or even just letting the conversation fade would have been much more appropriate than launching into personal attacks.

The author's decision to cut ties after being insulted was completely reasonable and showed good self-respect.

The author is expressing feeling inadequate when their partner has sexual fantasies about others and masturbates to them. This is a common insecurity that many people experience in relationships. The author states they're not trying to be controlling and haven't forbidden their partner from having these thoughts - they've simply communicated how it makes them feel.

However, the partner's response of ""pretending like the whole ordeal is my fault"" and saying the author is ""overreacting"" suggests dismissiveness of the author's feelings rather than engaging in productive dialogue about boundaries and comfort levels.

Sexual fantasies about others are generally considered normal human behavior, but relationships require ongoing communication about what makes each partner comfortable. The author has a right to express their feelings, and the partner has a right to their private thoughts. The issue seems to be in how they're communicating about this mismatch.

Neither person appears to be fundamentally wrong - one has normal human fantasies, the other has normal human insecurities. But both could handle the communication better.

The friend's comments go far beyond mere disagreement or even typical prejudice - suggesting someone should be ""put down"" contains violent undertones that are deeply concerning.

The author's response of avoiding the friend and questioning the relationship is completely reasonable and proportionate. Choosing not to associate with someone who expresses violent hatred toward marginalized groups is a matter of personal values and boundaries, not an overreaction. The author has every right to decide they cannot maintain a friendship with someone whose views they find morally reprehensible.

The author had good intentions - wanting to protect someone they cared about. However, their approach was problematic in several ways:

1. **Overstepping boundaries**: The author inserted themselves into someone else's relationship without being asked
2. **Threatening behavior**: Making a ""break her bones"" threat to the boyfriend was inappropriate and potentially intimidating
3. **Lack of respect for autonomy**: The author didn't consider that the woman might not want this kind of ""protection"" or interference

The woman's angry reaction suggests she felt her agency was undermined and her relationship was inappropriately interfered with. Even though the author meant well, good intentions don't excuse crossing clear social boundaries.

The boyfriend and the woman don't appear to have done anything wrong based on the information provided. The relationship ending seems unrelated to the author's intervention.

Looking at this scenario, the author is being honest about their motivations - they would marry primarily due to pregnancy and take responsibility for their actions. When the pregnancy ends in miscarriage, they're questioning whether to proceed with a wedding that was planned for different reasons than typical marriages.

Key considerations:

- Proceeding with a marriage based solely on obligation (when that obligation no longer exists) could be unfair to both parties

- Cultural and personal values around marriage, responsibility, and commitment vary significantly

The author isn't necessarily wrong for reconsidering, as marrying someone primarily out of obligation rather than love/compatibility when that obligation no longer exists could lead to an unhappy marriage for both people. However, the woman's feelings and the specific dynamics of their relationship would be critical factors.

The author initially communicated clearly that everyone would be expected to contribute $30 regardless of whether they stayed overnight, and everyone initially agreed to this arrangement. This upfront communication was appropriate for organizing a group event.

However, the couple later changed their mind and raised legitimate concerns about paying the same amount as overnight guests when they're only attending briefly and contributing in other ways (alcohol and gifts).

The real issue is how the couple is handling their disagreement. Rather than working directly with the author to find a compromise, they're ""going around asking other people"" about the payment arrangement. This approach is problematic because it:
- Undermines the author's position as the organizer
- Creates potential drama and division within the friend group
- Could destabilize the entire financial arrangement for the event
- Shows poor conflict resolution skills

Hu...",Author,Author,0.8,0.8571428571428571,True,"Looking at this situation, I can see the frustration and financial strain you're experiencing. However, I need to consider the fundamental dynamics at play here.

Your parents provided 3.5 years of free childcare, which represents an enormous financial gift - likely worth tens of thousands of dollars. When they asked you to move closer to make the arrangement work better, you made that choice as adults weighing the pros and cons. While they were enthusiastic about it, ultimately you and your husband decided to buy a house you didn't really want in an area you didn't like, doubling your mortgage payment.

The key issue is that your mother became genuinely ill and her doctor advised her to stop providing childcare for health reasons. This wasn't a voluntary abandonment - it was a medical necessity. While the timing was terrible and the transition abrupt, she was dealing with a serious health crisis.

Your expectation that they should now provide financial assistance seems to stem from feeling they bear responsibility for your current predicament. However, they fulfilled their original commitment for years beyond what most grandparents would do. The move was your family's decision based on making a free childcare arrangement more convenient.

The financial strain is real and difficult, but it appears to be the result of building your budget around a temporary arrangement (free family childcare) rather than planning for the inevitable transition to paid care.

The author made several problematic choices:
- Failed to clarify assignment due dates when there was confusion with the substitute
- Participated in creating and presumably sharing a video that mocked school staff, including their current teacher
- While they claim they opposed including their Italian teacher in the video, they still participated in its creation and distribution

The Italian teacher also behaved inappropriately:
- Made an extremely cruel and unprofessional comment about the student's hospitalized grandmother (""that's what you get for not doing your homework"")
- This response shows a serious lack of empathy and professionalism that crosses ethical boundaries for educators

The substitute teacher contributed to the problem by giving incorrect information about assignment due dates, creating the initial confusion.

However, the teacher's comment about the grandmother was so egregiously inappropriate that it represents a more serious breach of professional conduct than the student's actions. While the student made poor choices, they were responding (albeit inappropriately) to genuinely hurtful treatment from an authority figure who should have maintained professional standards.

The video, while disrespectful, appears to have been a reaction to the teacher's cruel behavior, and the student did express some reluctance about including their teacher.

For the past couple of weeks I was seeing this guy casually (N) that I met off Tinder and things were going pretty well...",Other,Other,0.85,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to evaluate the communication breakdown and expectations on both sides.

The author established clear boundaries and communicated them appropriately. When N said ""I'm coming now"" at 8pm while she was having dinner with family, she immediately responded in caps telling him not to come because she was eating with family. This was clear communication of her unavailability at that moment.

N's behavior shows several problematic patterns:
1. He has a history of flaking multiple times
2. He ignored her clear ""don't come"" message about dinner
3. He failed to respond to her dinner text or ask for clarification about timing
4. He showed up unannounced at 9:44pm without confirming it was okay
5. He expected to be let in despite the lack of communication

The author acted reasonably by going to bed at 9pm when there was radio silence after she told him not to come during dinner. Given his history of flaking and his lack of response, it was logical to assume he wasn't coming. She maintained her sleep schedule for work the next day, which shows responsibility.

N's expectation that he could show up unannounced late at night after ignoring her clear communication about dinner shows poor judgment and disrespect for boundaries.

While I understand your frustration with your roommate's indecisiveness and his pattern of leaving household responsibilities to you, the fundamental issue here is that you used his private bedroom without his explicit permission. Even though you pay equal rent, his bedroom is his personal space, and he has the right to control access to it.

Your roommate does bear some responsibility for poor communication - initially seeming agreeable, then changing his mind, and not being clear about his decision timeline. His cleanliness standards and general approach to shared responsibilities also contributed to the conflict.

However, the core boundary violation was letting people sleep in his room after he had said no. You had other options available, even if inconvenient - your friends could have found alternative accommodations, some could have stayed elsewhere, or you could have postponed the visit.

Both parties made mistakes, but the more serious fault lies with violating someone's private space without consent.

The girlfriend volunteered to help with shipping a collectible item and was given specific instructions. She admits to not reading the full instructions and making assumptions about the shipping method, choosing a less protective option despite being told the safer method was only a dollar more. This shows a lack of care in following through on her commitment.

However, the author's response - completely shutting down communication, ignoring texts and calls, and refusing to engage in any discussion - is disproportionate to the mistake. The girlfriend is being apologetic and trying to communicate, but the author is stonewalling her. While being upset is understandable, the silent treatment approach is problematic in a relationship context.

The girlfriend made a careless mistake despite good intentions, but the author is handling the aftermath poorly by refusing all communication rather than working through the issue together.

My parents had a nasty divorce and ...,Other,Other,0.8,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the communication expectations and emotional responses from both sides.

The author made a significant life change (moving back to her dad's area) and didn't immediately inform her mother, who found out indirectly when asking for the boyfriend's address. While the author was genuinely exhausted and had practical reasons for the delay, this is the kind of major life update that most parents would expect to hear about promptly, especially given the strained relationship dynamics already in place.

However, the mother's response was extremely disproportionate and emotionally abusive. Calling the father a ""sperm donor,"" threatening to cut off financial support, canceling phone service, and sending multiple paragraphs of hurtful messages goes far beyond what would be reasonable even if she felt hurt about not being informed immediately.

The author's communication could have been better - a quick text saying ""moving back to dad's area, will call tomorrow to explain"" would have prevented this escalation. But the author's mistake was relatively minor and understandable given the circumstances (exhaustion, relationship stress, complex family dynamics).

The mother's reaction reveals deeper issues and an inability to handle disappointment or perceived slights in a healthy way. Her response was punitive and designed to hurt rather than resolve the communication issue.

While the author bears some responsibility for the communication delay, the mother's extreme overreaction and emotionally harmful response makes her primarily at fault for how this situation escalated.

The author went on a date with someone who had misrepresented her interests (claiming to want to see the museum but only wanting photos), dominated conversations without showing reciprocal interest, and made no gesture toward sharing the bill despite having initiated the date and expressing that she ""had so much fun.""

However, the author also bears some responsibility here. They chose to stay through the entire date despite being unhappy halfway through, continued to fake engagement rather than communicate their discomfort, and had an expectation about bill-splitting that wasn't clearly communicated beforehand. The author could have politely ended the date early or been more direct about their interests and expectations.

The date's behavior was inconsiderate - misrepresenting intentions, being self-centered in conversation, and showing no courtesy regarding payment. But the author's passive approach and failure to communicate or set boundaries also contributed to their negative experience.

Both parties could have handled this situation better through clearer communication and more considerate behavior.

Hi...",Nobody,Nobody,0.75,0.6190476190476191,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives and actions of both parties.

The father's actions appear to have legitimate parental concerns behind them - wanting to ensure proper sleep schedules and managing screen time are reasonable parenting decisions. The timing (10-11pm) is actually quite reasonable for a household WiFi shutdown, especially if this affects a minor child. Parents do have the right to make decisions about utilities they pay for and household rules.

However, the author's frustration seems understandable given the context. They saved their own money for the PC, and the WiFi restriction appears to be specifically targeting the computer rather than internet access generally (since phone data still works). The author also acknowledges their usage isn't excessive and shows self-awareness about the situation.

The key issue is whether the father's motivation is purely punitive/spiteful versus genuinely concerned parenting. While the author suspects spite, parents often implement rules that seem targeted when they're actually trying to address specific concerns they have about particular activities or devices.

The author isn't being unreasonable in feeling frustrated, but getting ""mad"" at a parent for setting household rules - even if those rules feel unfair - crosses into problematic territory when the rules themselves aren't unreasonable.

This seems like a normal parent-child conflict where both sides have valid points but need better communication.

However, these feelings don't justify trying to control what army their friend chooses to play.

The author acknowledges that Larry has the right to choose whatever army he wants, and there are legitimate reasons why Larry might want Imperial Guard - they work well with his existing Space Marines, he might genuinely enjoy their playstyle, or he might have been inspired by seeing the author play them successfully. The author's desire to prevent Larry from choosing this army stems from personal feelings rather than any actual harm being done.

While it's natural to feel some possessiveness over something you've invested heavily in, attempting to dictate another person's hobby choices based on those feelings crosses into selfish territory. The gaming hobby is meant to be enjoyable for everyone involved, and there's room for multiple people to play the same faction.

The friend's father's comment ""I hope you're looking after her"" was probably meant as a protective, caring statement about someone he's known for over a decade - essentially his daughter's close friend. While it may have felt presumptuous, it came from a place of genuine care rather than malice.

The author's response ""well yes, I hope you look after your wife also?"" was unnecessarily confrontational and sarcastic. Even if the father's approach wasn't ideal, responding with what amounts to a veiled insult about his marriage was disproportionate and guaranteed to create tension. The author acknowledges making it ""kind of awkward"" and that their girlfriend was ""NOT happy"" - clear indicators that their response crossed a line.

While I understand the author values proper introductions and felt slighted, there were many better ways to handle this - from simply introducing themselves, to giving a gracious response, to addressing it privately with their girlfriend later if it really bothered them.

One o...,Other,Other,0.75,0.8888888888888888,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the responsibilities and actions of each party involved.

The author was clear and direct in rejecting romantic advances while offering continued friendship. She explicitly gave her friend an ""out"" by saying she'd understand if he no longer wanted to be friends. Her position that people should respect clearly stated boundaries is reasonable.

The friend said he could handle remaining friends despite his feelings, but his continued obvious romantic interest suggests he may not be respecting the boundary that was set. If he's unable to genuinely accept a platonic friendship, the honest thing would be for him to step back rather than continue hoping to change her mind.

The father and brother, while perhaps well-intentioned, are essentially arguing that women should manage men's emotions and make decisions for them based on gender stereotypes (""that's just how guys are""). This places unfair responsibility on the author for her friend's choices and feelings.

However, there's some validity to the concern that maintaining the friendship might inadvertently encourage false hope, even if that's not the author's intention. The situation has some complexity around whether continuing the friendship is truly kind to someone who can't move past romantic feelings.

The author has been clear about boundaries and given her friend agency to make his own decisions. The primary responsibility lies with the friend to either genuinely accept friendship or be honest about needing distance.

The group was talking loudly enough that it prevented the author from hearing the comedian's setups, which is clearly inconsiderate in a performance venue.

The author's initial response was appropriate - they waited 30 minutes before saying anything, and when they did speak up, it was done quietly and politely (""guys, you're killin' me here""). This is exactly the kind of reasonable approach one should take when dealing with disruptive behavior.

The group's reaction after the show was particularly problematic. They complained to strangers about the author ""ruining"" their experience, when they were the ones being disruptive. Their suggestion that the author should ""stay home next time if I can't enjoy a show with people talking"" shows a fundamental misunderstanding of appropriate venue etiquette - comedy shows are meant to be listened to, not talked through.

The author's final response was measured and factual, pointing out that talking during performances is inappropriate and that others paid to hear the comedian, not their commentary.

1. You parked in your coworker's ""favorite"" parking spot

Your coworker hiding your keys was inappropriate and potentially could have caused you significant inconvenience or even safety issues if you needed your car urgently. Your response of removing his valve stems was a further escalation that could strand him and potentially create a safety hazard, especially since you didn't leave the tool for repairs.

The author and girlfriend had agreed to work on their eating habits together, and she was clearly abandoning their agreement at the wedding. However, the author's response - deliberately overfilling her plate to make a point in front of both families - was passive-aggressive, humiliating, and inappropriate for the setting.

While the girlfriend may have been disregarding their diet agreement, a wedding is a special occasion where many people make exceptions to their usual eating habits. More importantly, the author chose to handle this through public humiliation rather than having a private conversation later.

The author's method of ""taking a stand"" was controlling and embarrassing. There were many better ways to address this - discussing it privately later, having a gentle conversation during the event, or simply letting it go for one special occasion and addressing the broader pattern afterward.

The author made a joke using ""disabled"" as a derogatory term about a sports team, which is problematic language that can be hurtful to people with disabilities. When someone expressed that they were offended, the author responded with ""edgy jokes"" and told them they ""have a problem"" rather than showing understanding or apologizing.

The other person responded by calling the author ""mentally disabled"" as an insult and then blocking them, which is also inappropriate use of disability as a slur.

While the author has their own disability (Hemophilia) and uses humor to cope with their condition, this doesn't justify using disability-related language in ways that can hurt others, nor does it excuse dismissing someone else's feelings when they express being offended.

The author's dismissive attitude toward their partner's legitimate concerns, combined with their pattern of boundary violations, demonstrates a lack of respect for the relationship.

The coworker is being pushy about food sharing, which is annoying, but she appears to have good intentions and genuinely means well. Being socially awkward or not picking up on hints isn't really being ""at fault"" - it's more of a social skills issue than a moral failing.

The author is feeling frustrated, which is completely understandable, but hasn't actually done anything wrong yet. They're considering having a direct conversation about boundaries, which would actually be the appropriate and mature way to handle this situation.

This seems to be a case of interpersonal friction due to different communication styles and social awareness levels, rather than anyone actually doing something wrong or harmful. The coworker isn't malicious, and the author is handling their frustration reasonably by considering a direct conversation rather than being passive-aggressive or mean.

Sometimes workplace dynamics involve minor annoyances that don't really constitute anyone being ""at fault"" - they're just part of navigating different personalities and communication styles.

On the day she texts me telling me she can't meet u...",Author,Author,0.8,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider both perspectives and the pattern of behavior.

The girl appears to have a legitimate reason for canceling (being sick), apologized multiple times, and actively tried to reschedule and make amends. Being chronically ill isn't something she can control, and her efforts to communicate and fix the situation show she cares about the relationship and respects the author.

However, the author's response - giving one-word answers, stopping communication entirely, and now ghosting her - is disproportionate to the situation. While it's understandable to feel disappointed about canceled birthday plans, completely cutting off communication without explanation after someone has apologized and tried to make things right is unnecessarily harsh. Even if this pattern has happened 2-3 times over a year, that's not an excessive frequency for someone dealing with chronic health issues.

If the author is no longer interested in pursuing this relationship due to incompatibility around her health issues, the mature approach would be to communicate that directly rather than ghosting. The silent treatment and ignoring her attempts to reconnect shows a lack of basic respect and communication skills.

The author's reaction seems more about punishing her for something largely outside her control rather than addressing the underlying compatibility issue constructively.

The regular homeless man:
- Violated mall rules by sleeping inside
- Became disruptive and demanding during closing
- Escalated to physical violence by punching you
- Refused to leave when asked multiple times

You (the author):
- Initially allowed sleeping until closing time (reasonable flexibility)
- Attempted to handle the situation professionally
- Used appropriate physical intervention only after being assaulted
- Followed proper procedures by documenting with CCTV and witness

Your team leader:
- Overruled your professional judgment without working your shift
- Dismissed legitimate security concerns
- Called you harsh for wanting to reinstate a ban after physical assault

The on-call person created some confusion by apparently promising cigarettes, but this seems minor compared to the main issues.

While I have sympathy for the homeless man's situation, being elderly and homeless doesn't excuse physical assault against security personnel. You showed reasonable accommodation initially and only escalated your response after being punched. Your team leader's dismissal of a physical assault against staff is problematic and undermines security protocols.

The primary fault lies with the homeless man for escalating to violence, and secondarily with your team leader for poor judgment in handling the situation.

Putting a hand basket on the conveyor belt without unloading it first is generally considered poor etiquette. The standard practice is for customers to unload their own items onto the belt - this makes the checkout process more efficient and shows consideration for the cashier's workload. Most grocery stores expect customers to do this basic step themselves.

However, the cashier's response was also problematic. While she had legitimate reason to be frustrated, her unprofessional behavior - the dirty looks, glaring, silent treatment, and deliberately ignoring you while chatting with other customers - was inappropriate workplace conduct that made the situation unnecessarily hostile.

You seem genuinely unaware that this was improper etiquette, which suggests this wasn't intentionally inconsiderate behavior. The fact that you're questioning whether you've been doing something wrong shows good faith.

The author was respectful in both situations - he asked directly, accepted the rejections gracefully, and maintained friendships afterward. Having feelings for different people over time is completely normal human behavior. The timeline shows several months between the two instances, which isn't unusually fast for developing new romantic interests, especially since he had a pre-existing crush on the second person that simply rekindled.

The criticism from the friend group seems to be based on an unrealistic expectation that romantic feelings should follow some arbitrary timeline or that asking out multiple people (respectfully and separately) is somehow wrong. This appears to be more about their judgment and gossip than any actual wrongdoing on the author's part.

The author handled both situations maturely and ethically. Having romantic feelings for different people over time and expressing those feelings respectfully is normal dating behavior, not something deserving of social ostracism.

The author is clearly concerned about their dog's wellbeing and is considering their pet's needs despite the health risks to themselves. Air quality at this level poses real health risks to both humans and dogs, and the author's reluctance to go outside is completely justified from a health perspective.

The dog's disappointed expression is natural animal behavior - dogs don't understand air quality concerns. This isn't anyone being at fault; it's an unfortunate environmental situation where the author is trying to balance competing priorities (their health vs. their pet's exercise needs) in a responsible way.

The author is dealing with legitimate frustration about their sister's relationship choices and the timing impact on their wedding. However, kicking their pregnant sister out of the wedding - especially when the pregnancy timing appears to be coincidental rather than intentional sabotage - crosses into harsh territory. The author admits to saying regrettable things while ""livid"" and seems to be conflating their disapproval of the boyfriend with punishment of their sister.

The sister has made consistently poor relationship choices despite family concerns, but being pregnant and due around the wedding date isn't inherently malicious toward the author. The sister's silence could indicate hurt at being excluded from this major family event.

The boyfriend sounds problematic based on the description (cheating, emotional harm, inability to hold jobs), but he's not directly involved in the wedding conflict.

While the author's feelings about their sister's choices are understandable, removing her from the wedding party seems disproportionate to the ""offense"" of having an inconveniently timed pregnancy. The author appears to be letting their anger about the relationship situation override their judgment about what's fair regarding the wedding.

The author noticed their sock organization was different and immediately concluded their girlfriend was ""snooping"" through their drawers. However, there are several innocent explanations for why someone with access to the house might have interacted with the dresser:

- She might have been doing laundry as a helpful gesture
- She could have been looking for something she left there
- She might have been putting away clean clothes
- The socks could have gotten mixed during normal use/washing

The key issue is that the author jumped to the conclusion of ""snooping"" - which implies secretive, inappropriate behavior - without any evidence of wrongdoing or even attempting to communicate with their girlfriend about it. This assumption is unfair and potentially damaging to the relationship.

The girlfriend hasn't necessarily done anything wrong. Having access to someone's home (with a key they provided) doesn't mean every interaction with household items constitutes snooping.

The author should have simply asked their girlfriend about the drawer rather than assuming malicious intent.

The author has legitimate concerns about her boyfriend giving gifts to coworkers who have clearly expressed romantic interest in him. Girl 1 has openly hit on him and made inappropriate comments, while Girl 2 regularly compares her fiancé unfavorably to the boyfriend - both behaviors that cross professional and relationship boundaries.

However, the author's approach of telling her boyfriend not to get them anything at all seems controlling. While her concerns are valid, demanding he exclude specific coworkers from gift-giving could create workplace awkwardness and doesn't address the underlying boundary issues.

The boyfriend appears to be in a difficult position - trying to maintain professional relationships while navigating inappropriate behavior from coworkers. However, his reasoning for the gifts (feeling ""obligated"" due to a $10 ticket, needing something ""more expensive"" because he sits near Girl 2) suggests he may not be setting appropriate boundaries himself.

The two female coworkers are clearly behaving inappropriately by pursuing someone they know is in a relationship, especially Girl 2 who is engaged herself.

This seems like a situation where everyone bears some responsibility - the author for being controlling rather than addressing the real boundary issues, the boyfriend for not setting clearer boundaries with inappropriate coworkers, and the coworkers for their inappropriate behavior toward someone in a relationship.

While the friend's alleged stealing and manipulative behavior (if true) is problematic, the author is actively choosing to engage in harmful behaviors like gossip and verbal aggression rather than simply ending the friendship. The author also frames normal social sharing (discussing interests, identity topics) as somehow wrongful ""shoving"" and attempted coercion.

The author has agency here - they could end this friendship they clearly don't value, but instead they're choosing to stay and engage in destructive patterns.

The author (daughter) approached this maturely - she had an adult conversation about birth control, was encouraged by her mother's initial supportive response, and made a reasonable request for medical advice. When her mother began lecturing and prying into her personal life, the author set appropriate boundaries by refusing to share details about her sexual partners.

The mother, while perhaps well-intentioned, is at fault here for several reasons:
1. She created a ""bait-and-switch"" situation by initially being supportive and encouraging openness, then using that openness to lecture and shame her daughter
2. She's being intrusive by demanding information about ""the boy"" and sexual details
3. She's using guilt tactics and religious arguments after initially presenting herself as supportive of birth control
4. She's making her adult daughter feel bad about decisions she's already made
5. She's getting angry when her daughter maintains reasonable boundaries

The author is being responsible by seeking birth control, setting boundaries, and trying to navigate this difficult situation respectfully. The insurance coverage doesn't give the mother the right to be judgmental or intrusive about her adult daughter's private medical decisions.

The author is experiencing discomfort about his new girlfriend's social media presence featuring her ex-boyfriend from a previous relationship. His feelings are understandable - it can be awkward when friends and family see these photos and comment on them. However, the girlfriend has already explained her position: these posts represent a significant part of her life history that she chooses not to delete, and she's assured him there are no remaining feelings.

The key issue here is that asking someone to delete their social media history, especially when they've already explained their reasoning, crosses into controlling behavior territory. Social media posts are personal digital history, and people have the right to maintain their own online presence as they see fit. The girlfriend has been transparent about her lack of feelings for her ex, which shows good communication.

The author's discomfort, while natural, doesn't justify asking his partner to alter her digital history to make him more comfortable, especially in such a new relationship (only a couple of weeks). This would be placing his insecurities above her autonomy.

The father's intentions may have been good - wanting to help his son - but the execution was problematic. Ambushing a shy 16-year-old with an unsolicited intervention about his masculinity and dating life, especially with another sibling present, was likely to feel humiliating and judgmental. The message essentially communicated ""you're not good enough as you are"" rather than offering genuine support.

The 16-year-old's explosive reaction, while understandable given the circumstances, was disrespectful. However, this appears to be a teenager lashing out when feeling cornered and criticized for simply being himself.

The author went along with this intervention without questioning whether it was appropriate, and while expressing some sympathy afterward, still fundamentally agrees with the approach and considers the brother ""ungrateful.""

The core issue here is that a naturally introverted, academically-focused teenager was being pressured to conform to his family's more extroverted social model. There's nothing inherently wrong with being bookish, shy, or less interested in dating at 16.

- She immediately accused the author of ""wasting time"" rather than asking neutrally about their day
- She demanded to see private browsing history without any reasonable cause for suspicion
- She attempted to physically take control of the computer without permission

- They didn't escalate the conflict physically or emotionally
- Setting boundaries about privacy is healthy in relationships
- There's no indication of any actual wrongdoing that would warrant such scrutiny

The girlfriend's trust issues, while potentially understandable given past experiences, don't justify violating her partner's reasonable expectation of privacy.

The author's partner is 6 months pregnant with twins, which is physically demanding and uncomfortable. Pregnancy often causes swelling, aches, and discomfort, particularly in the feet and legs. She made a specific request for comfort and support from her partner.

The author declined the request, citing personal preference (not liking to touch feet) and wanting to do something else instead. While everyone has bodily autonomy and the right to say no to physical contact, the context matters significantly here.

In a committed relationship, especially during pregnancy, there's typically an expectation of mutual support and care during challenging times. The author mentions doing ""a good amount"" for her already, but pregnancy is an ongoing condition that requires sustained support, not a tally system.

The partner's reaction, while emotionally charged, reflects frustration at feeling unsupported during a vulnerable time. Her calling him ""selfish"" suggests this may be part of a pattern rather than an isolated incident.

However, the author isn't obligated to provide physical contact they're uncomfortable with, and there could have been alternative ways to show care and support.

The author has expressed a clear boundary about being uncomfortable with his fiancée attending a male strip show. He communicated this respectfully and even asked a hypothetical question to help illustrate his point. He's not accusing his fiancée of potential cheating - he explicitly states she's not the type to cheat. This appears to be about personal comfort levels and boundaries in the relationship.

The fiancée and her sister are dismissing his concerns as ""overreacting"" and ""no big deal"" without really engaging with why this matters to him. While they may genuinely see it as harmless entertainment, they're not acknowledging that relationship boundaries are about mutual comfort and respect, not just objective harm. The fiancée also applied a double standard by saying his hypothetical strip club visit would be ""different.""

However, this also involves reasonable people who may simply have different perspectives on what constitutes appropriate entertainment in a committed relationship. The fiancée may genuinely view this as innocent fun, and strip shows can indeed be quite different from strip clubs in terms of atmosphere and interaction.

The core issue is that they need to find a compromise that respects both of their comfort levels rather than dismissing each other's concerns.

My problem with this is ...",Other,Nobody,0.75,0.8,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the responsibilities and circumstances of all parties involved.

The 15-year-old author is expressing legitimate concerns about living conditions that sound genuinely problematic - describing the home as ""low-key hoarder filthy"" and noting that cleaning efforts are immediately undone suggests serious hygiene and safety issues. At 15, they have some capacity to voice concerns about their living situation, but they're still a minor dependent on their parents' custody arrangement.

The mother appears to be struggling with maintaining basic household cleanliness and only responds to external pressure to clean. This suggests possible underlying issues (mental health, depression, etc.) but also represents a failure to provide a safe, healthy environment for her child.

The father and the family system seem to be prioritizing the principle of maintaining the mother-child relationship over the child's immediate living conditions and practical needs (like school proximity).

However, this appears to be a complex family situation where the mother may be dealing with issues beyond simple negligence, and the other adults are trying to balance multiple competing interests. The 15-year-old is caught in the middle of adult decisions and circumstances largely beyond their control.

While the living conditions are clearly problematic, this seems more like a family struggling with difficult circumstances rather than anyone being deliberately harmful or unreasonable.

You would think he's just a ""normal"" kid...",Author,Author,0.9,0.8,True,"This is a deeply troubling situation that requires careful consideration of the circumstances and the author's actions.

The author initially acted appropriately by complimenting the child's costume. However, when the situation became uncomfortable, the author made several attempts to disengage verbally before ultimately walking away - which was the right approach.

The critical fault lies in the author's decision to physically assault the child. Regardless of how annoying or persistent the child's behavior was, and regardless of whether the author knew about the child's disability at the time, physical violence against a child is never an acceptable response to being startled or annoyed. The author ""lost control"" and chose to ""beat up"" a child, landing ""fists on his face and body.""

While the author expresses genuine remorse and clearly feels terrible about what happened, this doesn't excuse the fundamental wrongness of the action. An adult has a responsibility to maintain self-control, especially around children, and to find non-violent solutions to uncomfortable situations.

The child's behavior, while persistent and annoying, was not malicious or threatening enough to justify physical retaliation. The child was engaging in what he thought was playful interaction, and his disability (unknown to the author at the time) likely contributed to his inability to read social cues about when to stop.

The other passenger was clearly in the wrong here. While there's generally an expectation to facilitate passenger flow on crowded public transit, several key factors make his behavior inappropriate:

1. **Alternative path available**: You mention there was a clear second lane for people to exit, meaning your position wasn't actually blocking anyone's ability to get off the train.

2. **Low passenger volume**: Only 2 people total were getting off, so this wasn't a crowded situation requiring maximum flow efficiency.

3. **Escalation to aggression**: Even if the passenger felt inconvenienced, calling you names and physically pushing you crosses a clear line into unacceptable behavior.

4. **No actual obstruction**: The fact that ""no one else had any trouble getting on or off"" confirms you weren't creating a real impediment.

Your positioning strategy makes sense for a multi-stop journey, and you indicate you do move when there are significant numbers of people - showing you're generally considerate of transit etiquette. The other passenger seemed to expect you to move based on principle rather than necessity, then became hostile when you didn't comply with his preference.

Physical contact and verbal abuse are never appropriate responses to minor transit inconveniences, especially when alternative solutions exist.

Susan...",Author,Author,0.8,0.7777777777777778,True,"Looking at this situation, the author's initial reaction was quite hurtful and inappropriate, even if it came from a place of concern.

While the author may have legitimate worries about their friend's decision-making patterns, laughing at someone's engagement announcement and immediately calling it ""one of the biggest mistakes"" they've ever made is a harsh and insensitive response. This reaction would understandably hurt anyone sharing what they consider happy news.

However, the author did recognize their mistake relatively quickly. They apologized during the conversation, clarified that it was just their opinion, expressed support for their friend's happiness, and followed up with additional apologies via voicemail. This shows self-awareness and genuine remorse.

Susan's hurt feelings and decision to end the evening early are completely understandable given how her news was received. Her emotional response was natural and justified.

The author's concerns about their friend's maturity and life choices aren't necessarily wrong, but the timing and delivery were poor. There are more tactful ways to express concern about a friend's major life decisions than laughing and immediately being critical.

The author made a significant social misstep but attempted to make amends. While their concerns may be valid, their initial reaction was the primary cause of the conflict.

Despite multiple requests to stop, the partner continues the behavior, dismisses the author's feelings as ""such a small thing,"" and then blames the author for ""ruining Valentine's Day"" when they're upset about continued boundary violations.

The partner's behavior shows a pattern of:
1. Ignoring clearly stated boundaries
2. Continuing unwanted physical contact after being asked to stop
3. Making excuses (""wasn't thinking,"" ""didn't mean it"")
4. Minimizing the author's feelings

The author has done nothing wrong by setting reasonable boundaries, communicating them clearly, and being upset when those boundaries are repeatedly violated. The fact that the partner considers it ""such a small thing"" actually makes it worse - if it's so small and unimportant, why not simply stop doing it when asked?

The author was trying to protect someone they perceived to be in a vulnerable state from unwanted sexual contact. Their intention was clearly to help. However, the execution was problematic - physically pulling someone who is intoxicated and wearing high heels from an elevated surface created a dangerous situation that resulted in injury.

The drunk woman was heavily intoxicated and unable to properly consent or be aware of her surroundings, but this doesn't make her at fault for the situation.

The man engaging in unwanted physical contact with an intoxicated person who couldn't consent was clearly behaving inappropriately and potentially criminally.

While the author's heart was in the right place, they made a critical error in judgment by using physical force to remove someone from a dangerous situation in a way that created an even more immediate physical danger. A better approach would have been to alert security, bar staff, or find another way to intervene that didn't involve physically pulling an intoxicated person in heels from an elevated surface.

The author bears responsibility for the injury that occurred, even though their intentions were good. However, the primary wrongdoer was the man taking advantage of an intoxicated woman.

The author acknowledges that their girlfriend and friends aren't wrong to be afraid of rape and assault, which shows some understanding. However, they're characterizing legitimate safety precautions (like locking doors, being cautious walking alone, being wary of concerning behavior from men) as ""dwelling"" and unnecessarily fearful behavior.

The reality is that women face statistically significant risks of sexual assault and harassment. What the author perceives as ""endless"" fears are actually common-sense safety measures that many women adopt based on lived experiences, statistics, and societal realities. These aren't irrational fears or ""dwelling on scary things"" - they're reasonable responses to genuine risks.

The author seems to be minimizing their loved ones' legitimate concerns and suggesting they're choosing to be afraid, which shows a lack of understanding about the reality of women's experiences with safety. While their intention may be to help reduce their girlfriend's anxiety, their approach dismisses valid concerns rather than offering genuine support.

The emotional and psychological toll of experiencing all of this within a week would be enormous for anyone, let alone a teenager.

When the author snapped at their friends for repeatedly asking if they were okay, this was clearly a stress response from someone at their breaking point. The friends knew about all these traumatic events, yet they chose to ignore the context entirely and instead focused on their hurt feelings about being snapped at. Rather than showing empathy and understanding for someone in crisis, they gave the silent treatment and demanded an apology.

While it's understandable that the friends might have felt hurt, their response shows a significant lack of emotional maturity and compassion. They prioritized their minor discomfort over supporting someone experiencing genuine trauma and crisis. The fact that they made the author feel guilty enough to apologize while homeless and grieving shows poor judgment on their part.

The author's reaction was completely understandable given the circumstances, and their friends should have recognized this and been more supportive rather than punitive.

- Monopolizing one friend's house exclusively instead of rotating locations

The stepmother was justified in setting boundaries for her household. The friend who lives there is also somewhat at fault for not managing the situation better or standing up to his friends when it became excessive.

The author was in a difficult position when his cousins made genuinely offensive comments about potential children having a ""shit-like complexion."" His intention was to defuse tension by making what he thought was a lighter joke. However, his execution was deeply problematic.

The key issues:
1. The author failed to understand the power dynamics and historical context of colorism, particularly how it affects women of color
2. Instead of defending his girlfriend or shutting down the offensive comments, he essentially joined in with his own racially insensitive remark
3. His comparison to their mutual joking misses the crucial difference - jokes between partners in private versus public humiliation in front of hostile family members
4. He doubled down by calling her ""hypocritical"" instead of listening to her explanation about colorism

While the cousins were clearly worse with their initial offensive comments, and the author's intent wasn't malicious, his response was inappropriate and hurtful. He had other options - he could have defended her, changed the subject, or addressed his cousins directly. Instead, he made a comment that reinforced the very discrimination his girlfriend faces.

The author started by borrowing clothes without asking when she had nothing, which established a pattern. However, she was in a vulnerable position as a minor who had been placed with this family by police due to bad family circumstances. Her friend didn't object to this initial borrowing.

The problem escalated when the friend began taking the author's belongings without asking - including new purchases, favorite shoes (which got worn out), and makeup that she took places. The key difference is that the author was in crisis and borrowed basic clothing items, while the friend is taking personal items including new purchases and sentimental items without permission.

The author recognizes the issue and is trying to address it by communicating her feelings, which shows maturity and responsibility. She also expresses gratitude for the help she received and acknowledges feeling indebted.

While the author did start the pattern of borrowing without asking, her circumstances were extenuating, and she's now trying to resolve the situation constructively. The friend's behavior of taking new items and personal belongings without asking, especially items with sentimental value, is more problematic.

The author has legitimate parental rights that are being unreasonably restricted. After 2+ years of being consistently present and seeing his daughter 4-5 times per week, he has demonstrated commitment and responsibility as a father. The mother's concerns about the pool and his forgetfulness, while understandable as parental worries, don't constitute valid reasons to completely deny unsupervised visitation - these are manageable safety issues that responsible parents address through precautions.

However, filing for custody without any communication or warning was unnecessarily adversarial. Given their on-and-off relationship and attempts to work things out, this approach likely damaged trust and could have made future co-parenting more difficult.

The mother is being overly controlling by refusing any unsupervised time despite the father's consistent presence and lack of any incidents. Her fears, while genuine, are disproportionate and infringe on his parental rights.

That said, the author's approach of going straight to court without exhausting other options (like mediation or involving a neutral third party) was premature and potentially harmful to their co-parenting relationship.

The note was deliberately aggressive and profane (""fucking shameful,"" ""get your shit together""), which escalates conflict rather than solving it constructively. There were several better approaches available: speaking directly to the tenants, contacting the landlord to establish clear trash policies, or writing a firm but professional note.

This came across as saying the author wasn't worth the expense, even if that wasn't his conscious intention.

The author's hurt feelings are completely understandable, but the response (""thanked him for letting me know that I was worth less than $100"") escalated the conflict unnecessarily.

The fact that you're questioning whether this approach is right suggests you have some awareness that it might be problematic.

Even if your intentions are good (wanting friendship and having genuinely changed), you're denying them the opportunity to make an informed decision about whether they want to reconnect with you given your shared history.

This creates a foundation of dishonesty in these new friendships. While you may have changed, the ethical approach would be to be transparent about your identity and let them decide whether they're willing to give you another chance based on who you are now.

The wife made a mistake by not putting the headphones away despite knowing the dog's tendency to chew wires, which resulted in the $199 headphones being destroyed. However, this appears to be negligence rather than malicious intent.

The author, on the other hand, deliberately chose inaction when they saw their wife's pain therapy device in danger. They explicitly stated ""not my problem to myself"" and made a conscious decision to let the dog destroy her medical device as apparent retaliation for the headphones incident. This was intentional and vindictive behavior that escalated the situation.

While the wife's negligence started the chain of events, the author's deliberate choice to allow destruction of a medical device used for pain management crosses into more problematic territory. The author had the opportunity to prevent further damage but chose revenge instead of addressing the original issue constructively.

Both parties contributed to the overall situation, but the author's intentional retaliation makes this worse than simple negligence.

The neighbor appears to be neglecting basic childcare responsibilities. Children ages 5 and 4 should typically be potty trained and wearing appropriate clothing, especially when visiting other people's homes. Sending children over in soiled diapers without proper clothing shows a lack of consideration for both the children's dignity and the host's reasonable boundaries.

The author is being reasonable by:
- Setting appropriate hygiene boundaries in their own home
- Being concerned about the children's wellbeing and social development
- Recognizing that these children are being teased by peers

However, the author could handle this more constructively by having a direct, respectful conversation with the neighbor about expectations when the children visit, rather than just sending them home repeatedly.

The neighbor is primarily at fault for:
- Not ensuring age-appropriate toilet training
- Sending children to others' homes in unsanitary conditions
- Not dressing children appropriately for social visits
- Using the author's home as free childcare without maintaining basic standards

While the author could communicate more directly with the neighbor, they are not wrong to have hygiene boundaries in their own home or to be concerned about these children's welfare.

The grandmother clearly intended to give meaningful family heirlooms to all her grandchildren equally, distributing items by gender in what she thought was an equitable way. She had no knowledge that some items had significant monetary value while others didn't. Her intent was pure and fair.

The author is trying to address an unintended inequity that resulted from this well-meaning but uninformed distribution. By suggesting the son share half the proceeds with his sister if he sells the item, the author is attempting to honor both the grandmother's intent of equal treatment and create actual fairness given the dramatic value difference ($75,000 vs. essentially $0).

The son's resistance is understandable from his perspective - he received a ""gift"" and feels entitled to keep its full value. However, his argument about income differences doesn't change the fact that the grandmother intended equal treatment of all grandchildren.

The author is navigating a delicate situation thoughtfully, respecting the grandmother's feelings while trying to ensure fairness among the grandchildren. The suggestion to wait until after the grandmother passes shows sensitivity to her feelings, and the proposed sharing arrangement addresses the inequity without undermining the gift-giving moment.

291,Basically I decided to go on a camping road trip with a good friend of mine to visit some of my friends at different colleges. My gf did not want me to go with the friend because I drunkenly hooked up...,Nobody,Nobody,0.75,0.5,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the relationship dynamics and boundaries involved.

The author has a history of hooking up with this friend, even though it was before the current relationship and both parties have moved on. The girlfriend has expressed discomfort with the trip, which is understandable given the history. However, the author notes that everyone involved - including the girlfriend, the friend, and the friend's boyfriend - are all friends who trust each other.

The key factors here are:
- The hookup occurred before the current relationship
- Both the author and friend are in committed relationships now
- All parties involved are friends and reportedly trust each other
- The girlfriend has expressed her concerns

While the girlfriend's feelings are valid and understandable, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to maintain friendships and go on a trip with people in their friend group. The past hookup, while relevant context, doesn't automatically disqualify future platonic interactions, especially when everyone is aware and the relationships have evolved.

The author appears to be trying to balance respecting their girlfriend's feelings while also maintaining friendships. This seems like a situation where reasonable people could disagree about boundaries.

The author is experiencing a natural shift in their friendship dynamic. They were initially drawn to this person primarily due to physical attraction, and when that attraction diminished, they realized they don't have much in common conversationally or personality-wise. This kind of realization happens in many relationships and friendships.

Importantly, the author:
- Didn't criticize her hair choice
- Isn't planning to ghost her
- Is being honest about their feelings
- Recognizes she's a nice person, just not compatible with them
- Plans to distance themselves rather than continue a friendship they no longer enjoy

The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship they don't find fulfilling, especially when the foundation was largely physical attraction. They're handling this maturely by planning to distance themselves rather than being fake or cruel. Having preferences about who you spend time with based on compatibility is normal and healthy.

The friend hasn't done anything wrong either - she's just being herself, and there's nothing wrong with having different conversation styles or interests.

This appears to be a natural evolution of a friendship where two people simply aren't that compatible once the initial attraction factor is removed.

You withheld information about hanging out with a female friend from your girlfriend, even though it was innocent (her boyfriend was present). While you cite her ""trust issues"" as the reason, this secrecy ultimately damaged trust in the relationship.

However, your girlfriend's actions were significantly more problematic - she violated your privacy by going through your texts without permission, and more importantly, she had been actively cheating on you with a coworker.

While your lack of transparency wasn't ideal and contributed to relationship problems, it pales in comparison to actual infidelity and privacy violations. Your action was a poor communication choice, but hers involved fundamental betrayals of the relationship.

The core issue here is that she was cheating, which is a much more serious breach of trust than not mentioning an innocent hangout with friends.

Your friends gave you feedback that they genuinely seemed to believe - they said your story was clear, easy to read, and original. However, your professor (a professional author) had a very different assessment, calling it clichéd, illogical, and confusing. This suggests a few possibilities:

1. Your friends may have different standards or less developed critical skills than a professional
2. They may have been trying to be encouraging while still offering some criticism
3. There could be a significant gap between peer-level feedback and professional-level evaluation

The key issue is whether this constitutes ""lying."" Your friends appear to have given their honest opinion based on their perspective and skill level. They weren't maliciously deceiving you - they likely believed what they were saying. The fact that a professional disagreed doesn't automatically make their feedback dishonest.

While I understand your frustration and disappointment, ending a friendship over what appears to be a difference in critical ability rather than intentional deception seems disproportionate. Your friends tried to help within their capabilities.

The former friend made a move on an incapacitated person who was in a relationship with his close friend of 10 years. This shows poor judgment and a violation of trust. The pattern of similar behavior with other friends' girlfriends and lack of impulse control suggests this wasn't an isolated incident.

The girlfriend was blackout drunk and therefore not in a position to consent or make clear decisions. While being incapacitated doesn't excuse all behavior, her level of impairment is a significant mitigating factor.

The author has handled this reasonably - giving the girlfriend another chance after she demonstrated changed behavior, setting clear boundaries with the former friend while still being civil, and being willing to attend important events despite personal discomfort.

The friend group seems to be pressuring the author to ""get over it"" without fully considering the breach of trust involved.

The author has every right to choose who they want in their life, especially after a significant betrayal of trust. They've been mature about it - not demanding others choose sides, being willing to compromise for important events, and treating the former friend civilly while maintaining boundaries. A 10-year friendship being ended over such behavior is a natural consequence.

The aunt gave an extremely generous gift ($1,000 worth of Waterford crystal) with good intentions, believing she was providing something valuable and traditional for a young couple. While she went off-registry, gift-givers aren't strictly obligated to stick to registries - they're meant as guides, not requirements.

The author's feelings are understandable - they're practical people who would have preferred useful items they actually needed. However, being ""annoyed"" by a generous gift, even if impractical, crosses into ungrateful territory. The appropriate response would be to graciously accept the gift, appreciate the thought and generosity behind it, and perhaps save the crystal for special occasions or future use when their lifestyle might accommodate such items.

The author could have politely suggested registry items if asked, but there's no indication the aunt sought input. Gift-giving often involves the giver's personal taste and values, which is normal and acceptable.

While the mismatch between gift and preference is unfortunate, the author's annoyance toward someone who spent significantly on what they believed was a meaningful, traditional gift shows a lack of graciousness.

The tenant is clearly failing in their primary responsibility as a pet owner. They're leaving the dog kenneled for excessive periods, causing distress, then leaving it outside in cold weather without shelter after a haircut that removes its natural insulation. They're not providing proper exercise, socialization, or care. The dog's escape attempts are a direct result of this neglect and distress.

However, as landlords who accepted a pet and are collecting pet rent, the authors do have some responsibility for maintaining reasonable security of their property. A gate that a dog can ""squeeze through or jump over"" represents a basic maintenance issue that could affect any pet, regardless of how well-cared-for it is.

The tenant's aggressive threats are completely inappropriate, but their frustration about a faulty gate isn't entirely unreasonable from a landlord-tenant perspective.

The core issue is animal welfare - this dog is being neglected and is trying to escape an unsafe situation. While the authors aren't directly responsible for the tenant's poor pet care, they are in a position where they could take action (either fixing the gate promptly or reporting the animal neglect) but are choosing not to prioritize the animal's safety.

Both parties are failing the dog, though in different ways and to different degrees.

- You continued pushing your perspective even after she tried to redirect the conversation multiple times

She communicated her boundaries clearly - she enjoys makeup and it's part of who she is. Rather than accepting this, you kept arguing your point about preferring ""natural"" looks. From her perspective, this likely felt like you were trying to change something fundamental about her self-expression before you'd even met.

Your sister's hurt feelings are understandable - being consistently excluded from gifts while watching her sibling receive them year after year would be painful for anyone. At 19, she's still part of the family and likely feels rejected by your grandfather's pattern of exclusion.

However, your mother's response of taking half your money to give to your sister crosses an important boundary. That money was specifically given to you by your grandfather, and redistributing it without his consent undermines his autonomy as the gift-giver and your right to receive what was intended for you.

Your comment to ""get a grip"" was insensitive given your sister's genuine emotional pain, but it's also understandable that you'd be frustrated by this recurring drama every year. You're 15 and dealing with a complex family situation.

The real issue here seems to be your grandfather's pattern of excluding your sister, which creates ongoing family tension. Your mother is trying to manage hurt feelings but chose an inappropriate method.

The author invaded their boyfriend's privacy by going through his browsing history and online accounts without permission. This is a clear violation of trust and boundaries. Additionally, they're considering asking their partner to change or hide a harmless hobby based on their own prejudices and stereotypes about what makes someone ""masculine"" or ""grown up.""

The boyfriend has done nothing wrong - he has a perfectly normal hobby that he kept private due to social stigma (which this situation unfortunately validates). His only ""fault"" might be leaving his laptop open, but that's hardly blameworthy as people should be able to trust their partners to respect their privacy.

The author's attitude reflects harmful stereotypes about both anime fans and masculinity. Anime is a diverse medium enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds. The idea that enjoying animation makes someone less ""masculine"" or ""grown up"" is based on outdated gender stereotypes and cultural prejudices.

The name ""Moo Shu"" (or Mu Shu) refers to a specific Chinese dish, and you chose it simply because you liked the sound for your cat. There's no indication you intended anything derogatory or were trying to mock Chinese culture. Many people name pets after foods they enjoy - it's quite common.

However, your girlfriend has expressed that she finds this name problematic and racist. While you may not have intended harm, her concerns about cultural sensitivity deserve consideration. The fact that she's upset suggests this matters to her, and dismissing her feelings entirely wouldn't be fair to your relationship.

That said, calling a pet name inspired by a food dish ""really racist"" seems like an overreach. There's a difference between cultural insensitivity and actual racism. Many pet names come from food (Cookie, Pepper, etc.), and Chinese restaurant dishes are part of mainstream American culture at this point.

The friend has a documented history of being late, was specifically asked not to be late this time, and then arrived 40 minutes after the agreed time. While calling at 8:55 to say she was ""on her way"" provided some notice, it was essentially confirming she would be late rather than giving adequate warning. Most importantly, she didn't apologize upon arrival, which shows a lack of acknowledgment for the inconvenience caused.

The author's frustration is understandable given the pattern and the explicit request for punctuality. However, immediately launching into criticism without first giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize, and then walking away during the conversation, was somewhat reactive.

That said, the friend's response of claiming she ""tried her best"" without taking responsibility or showing remorse for the impact on others suggests a lack of consideration for the author's time and feelings.

Your sister has every right to set boundaries around prison visits, even if those decisions seem inconsistent or hurtful to you. The back-and-forth between forgiveness and condemnation you describe is actually a very normal response to having a parent who committed violent crimes - it's part of processing complex trauma and grief. Her decision to protect her children from this situation, regardless of their expressed feelings, is within her parental rights.

At the same time, your anger and disappointment are completely understandable. You're trying to maintain a relationship with your father and create meaningful moments within impossible circumstances. Your frustration with what feels like broken promises and inconsistency is valid.

However, neither of you is wrong for having different approaches to this tragedy. Your sister isn't obligated to visit or facilitate visits, even if previously agreed upon. You're not wrong for wanting family connection. This is a situation where two people are handling profound family trauma in different ways, and both responses are understandable given the circumstances.

The author clearly acknowledges major wrongdoing - cheating with three people despite knowing their partner had PTSD from previous infidelity, breaking a specific promise, and having professional knowledge that should have informed better behavior. This was a significant betrayal that caused substantial harm.

However, the ex-partner's response, while understandable given the trauma, included calling the author ""a bad person"" and saying other ""angry and hurtful words"" before blocking contact. While his pain was valid, the specific language used appears to have crossed into unnecessarily cruel territory.

The current conflict centers on whether the author should meet to discuss things for the ex's mental health. The author has the right to set boundaries about contact, especially after being told hurtful things. The ex's continued suicidal ideation is concerning but doesn't create an obligation for the author to engage.

Both parties made mistakes - the author through the initial betrayal, and the ex through unnecessarily cruel words during his justified anger. The author's current boundary-setting appears reasonable given the circumstances.

The core harm (cheating) was significantly more severe than the response (hurtful words), but both contributed to the overall dysfunction.

The author (Bison) is experiencing discomfort about his girlfriend's close relationship with her ex, which is understandable given that:
- The girlfriend admitted they still have feelings for each other
- The ex is engaging in romantic-seeming behaviors (baking food, buying gifts)
- He's concerned about being a rebound

However, Bison has handled this maturely by:
- Communicating his concerns to his girlfriend
- Not being hostile toward the ex despite discomfort
- Recognizing the ex is being nice to him
- Seeking advice rather than acting rashly

The girlfriend (G) seems to be in a difficult position but is being somewhat problematic by:
- Maintaining a close relationship with an ex while admitting mutual feelings still exist
- Not setting appropriate boundaries given her new relationship

The ex (X) appears to be overstepping boundaries by:
- Engaging in gift-giving and intimate gestures typically reserved for romantic partners
- Potentially trying to win back the girlfriend while she's in a new relationship

The author is being reasonable and mature in his approach. The main issues stem from the girlfriend not setting proper boundaries and the ex potentially interfering in the new relationship.

However, I need to consider the practical realities here.

You're 17 and don't have a job, so you're not contributing to the household grocery budget. Your parents are responsible for feeding a family of 5 (including two young children) on what appears to be a tight budget. When you ask them to change their entire shopping and eating habits to support your weight loss goals, you're essentially asking them to restructure the household around your personal goals without offering to contribute financially.

While your concerns about your brothers' health are valid, and your parents could certainly make better nutritional choices, the primary responsibility for your weight loss journey lies with you. You acknowledge being picky about healthy foods and struggling with self-control - these are personal challenges you need to work on regardless of what food is available.

Your parents aren't obligated to completely overhaul their household management to accommodate your weight loss goals, especially when you're not contributing to the grocery budget.

The girlfriend initially asked for a reasonable accommodation - not eating around her during fasting hours, which the author agreed to without issue. However, she then extended this to asking him not to cook during those hours (roughly 16 hours per day based on the 12-8 eating window), which significantly impacts his daily routine and food preferences.

The author has been making genuine efforts to accommodate her by switching to cereal and instant oatmeal, showing he's trying to be supportive. However, he's finding this restriction difficult to maintain long-term, particularly missing foods he enjoys like eggs and bacon for breakfast and popcorn during late-night movies.

While it's understandable that food smells might make fasting more challenging for the girlfriend, completely restricting cooking in their shared living space for the majority of each day seems unreasonable. The author has a right to prepare food in his own home, and the girlfriend's diet choice, while valid, shouldn't severely limit his basic daily activities.

The girlfriend appears to be asking for accommodations that go beyond what's reasonable to expect from a partner, even a supportive one.

When you and Amy asked them to plan for once, they essentially gave you a list of 12 restaurants and said ""you pick"" - that's not planning, that's just shifting the decision-making burden back to you while appearing to contribute. Real planning would involve them choosing a specific restaurant, time, and activities, just like you and Amy do when you plan (""Saturday I pick you up at 1, we go to X restaurant, then the mall, then my house for X movie"").

Then when Amy tried to make a decision from their list (Chili's), Josh got upset and rejected it, despite them being the ones who provided that option. This shows they weren't taking responsibility for their own ""planning.""

Your frustration was completely justified - you've been doing all the emotional and logistical labor for the friendship, and when you finally asked them to step up, they didn't really try. While your sarcastic comment wasn't ideal, it came from a place of legitimate frustration after repeatedly being let down.

The author has legitimate sexual needs that aren't being fully met in the relationship, and he's trying to find a solution that doesn't pressure his girlfriend. He's respected her preference for less frequent sex and her choice to use toys independently. From his perspective, purchasing a sex doll seems like a reasonable parallel to her use of vibrators/dildos.

However, his girlfriend's reaction suggests that she sees a meaningful difference between her toys and his sex doll. Many people view sex dolls (especially those with human-like features) as fundamentally different from traditional sex toys - they can feel more like simulating a relationship with another person rather than just physical stimulation. Her discomfort appears genuine and isn't necessarily unreasonable.

The core issue is that they have different perspectives on what constitutes equivalent behavior and different comfort levels with various forms of sexual expression. Neither person is inherently wrong for their sexual needs or boundaries, but they're struggling to find a mutually acceptable solution.

The author isn't maliciously trying to hurt his girlfriend, and she isn't being unreasonable for having boundaries about what makes her uncomfortable in the relationship. This appears to be a compatibility issue where both people have valid but conflicting needs and perspectives.

The author offered their friend a spare room as temporary help during a difficult time. This was a generous gesture to help someone in need. However, the friend brought two unknown women into the home without asking permission or giving advance notice. This is problematic for several reasons:

1. The house contains the author's family (mother, wife, and two children), making it a family home where safety and comfort are paramount
2. Basic courtesy dictates that houseguests should ask before bringing additional people into someone else's home
3. The friend's reaction (""looks at me like I busted him"") suggests he knew this was inappropriate
4. The living arrangement was meant to be temporary help for one person, not multiple people

The author has legitimate concerns about strangers in their family home and has every right to set boundaries about who can be there. The ""no girls rule"" might be poorly worded, but the underlying principle - that the friend cannot bring unknown guests without permission - is entirely reasonable.

The friend violated basic house rules and courtesy by bringing strangers into a family home without permission.

The author clearly stated they would ""have to get back to them"" about scheduling and never confirmed any appointment. They explicitly avoided agreeing to a specific time due to their schedule constraints. The company then unilaterally scheduled an appointment without the author's consent and sent a technician to their home.

While the author could have been more proactive in calling back to explicitly decline interest, they were under no obligation to do so since they never agreed to an appointment in the first place. The company's aggressive sales tactics - including 5 calls in a few days and scheduling an unauthorized visit - are the primary issue here.

You lied out of anger and spite about having a one-night stand when you actually didn't go through with it. This was dishonest and manipulative - you deliberately tried to hurt her emotionally as retaliation for feeling rejected.

She, believing your lie was true, slept with someone else that same night. Her action was a direct response to what she believed you had done. While this might not have been the healthiest coping mechanism, she was acting on information she believed to be true and was likely hurt by what she thought was your betrayal.

The key issue here is that your lie created a false reality that influenced her subsequent actions. She made her decision based on believing you had moved on and been with someone else. Your deception was the catalyst that set these events in motion.

While both of you could have handled the situation more maturely, the fundamental problem stems from your decision to lie as an act of emotional revenge. Her response, while perhaps not ideal, was based on what she reasonably believed to be true about your actions.

The friend's actions are clearly problematic - attempting to kiss someone after being told they only want friendship, asking inappropriate sexual questions, continuing unwanted romantic/sexual advances despite clear rejection, and using demeaning language like ""little bitch."" This constitutes sexual harassment and shows a complete disregard for boundaries and consent.

The author handled this reasonably well by:
- Initially trying to be supportive about the friend's sexuality
- Clearly communicating that he only wanted friendship
- Eventually removing himself from the harmful situation

While the author could have been more direct earlier about how unacceptable the behavior was, this doesn't make him at fault. As a 15-year-old dealing with an older peer's persistent harassment, his response was understandable and ultimately appropriate.

The friend's behavior was unacceptable regardless of his age or sexual orientation. Continuing to pursue someone sexually after rejection is wrong, and the escalating nature of his comments and actions made the situation increasingly uncomfortable for everyone involved.

You've repeatedly asked your husband to be mindful about playing explicit music around your 8-year-old daughter, which is a completely reasonable parental concern. The fact that this has been going on for 4 months with him agreeing each time but then continuing the behavior shows a pattern of disrespect for your clearly stated boundaries.

Your concerns are valid:
- Wanting quiet time in your own home
- Not wanting your young child exposed to inappropriate language
- Feeling unheard after multiple conversations

While your threat about running over the speaker was escalated language, it came after months of patient requests being ignored. Your husband's dismissive ""okay jeez!"" response suggests he's not taking your legitimate concerns seriously.

The core issue isn't about music preferences - it's about respect, co-parenting decisions, and basic consideration in a shared living space.

- Essentially monopolizing what was meant to be a shared resource

The author appears to be struggling with their daughter's harmless but unusual hobby of perfecting body movements and facial expressions. While the parent frames this as concern about ""usefulness"" and potential joint damage, the core issue seems to be aesthetic displeasure - they find these movements ""ugly"" and are embarrassed by them.

Key considerations:
- The child is engaging in creative, harmless self-expression that brings her joy and demonstrates persistence
- The parent is threatening punishment for natural, non-harmful behaviors
- The sister's encouragement, while potentially undermining the parent, supports the child's autonomy
- The parent's concerns about joint damage seem secondary to their aesthetic objections

The author is trying to control their child's harmless self-expression based primarily on personal aesthetic preferences rather than genuine safety or developmental concerns. Threatening punishment for facial expressions crosses into problematic territory of body autonomy and self-expression suppression.

The core problem here is a fundamental lack of communication from both sides about expectations, boundaries, and the temporary nature of the author's stay. Both parties made assumptions instead of having honest conversations about what they wanted from the relationship.

The ex-stepdad's Facebook message, while awkward and perhaps poorly timed, appears to be a genuine attempt to reconnect and express care. His message about wanting to be part of the author's life and expressing love seems sincere, even if clumsy.

The author's response was extremely harsh - calling him names, telling him to ""fuck off,"" and being deliberately hurtful. While the author has legitimate grievances about feeling abandoned after the remarriage, this level of vitriol toward someone trying to reach out is excessive.

The author had every right to maintain boundaries or decline a relationship, but could have done so with basic civility rather than such cruelty. The ex-stepdad's past behavior of distancing himself was hurtful, but his current attempt at reconciliation didn't warrant such a vicious response.

The author's reaction seems driven more by years of accumulated resentment than by anything the ex-stepdad actually said in this exchange.

The stalker is clearly engaging in harassment, potentially sexual harassment, and possibly stalking - all serious crimes. Your girlfriend did the right things by telling him to stop, blocking him, and filing a police report.

However, your actions were also criminal:
- Following someone home (stalking behavior)
- Vandalizing their property (criminal damage)
- Using a weapon (collapsible baton) to commit the crime
- Vigilante justice outside the legal system

While your protective instincts are understandable, you escalated to criminal behavior rather than working within the legal system. There were other options available: helping your girlfriend document everything more thoroughly, contacting police about the ongoing harassment, seeking legal aid for a restraining order, or consulting with a lawyer about civil remedies.

Your father (retired law enforcement) was right to be furious - you committed crimes that could result in serious charges against you, potentially making the situation worse for both you and your girlfriend.

The stalker's behavior doesn't justify criminal retaliation, even though his actions were wrong first.

The author is facing a genuine dilemma between personal attachment to their first car and legitimate safety concerns for their family. While they admit their primary concern was about potential damage to their car rather than safety, this is an understandable human reaction - being protective of one's first vehicle is normal.

However, the safety considerations here are quite serious. The other available vehicles have significant safety defects (non-functioning seatbelts and missing airbags), and they're dealing with hazardous winter driving conditions in an area that likely doesn't handle snow well. The uncle's safety during transport should be the top priority.

The author seems to recognize this conflict and is questioning their own priorities by asking if they're at fault. This shows some self-awareness about the situation.

The father could have been more transparent about the safety reasons from the start rather than just saying the car was ""nicer,"" which might have helped the author understand the true importance of the request.

While the author's initial focus on car damage over safety isn't ideal, they're grappling with a legitimate internal conflict and seem open to reconsidering their position. The safety imperative here is clear and should override concerns about potential vehicle damage.

Your concerns about the relationship's foundation and financial dependence are valid observations, but ultimately these are your brother's choices to make - even if they seem unwise. The grandparents are apparently willing participants in supporting them financially, so while you may disagree with this arrangement, it's not inherently wrong if all parties consent.

Your consideration of skipping the wedding over these issues suggests your anger may be clouding your judgment about family relationships and appropriate boundaries. You acknowledge potential bias due to personal issues with your brother, which is important self-awareness.

The ...",Author,Author,0.8,0.6956521739130435,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the complex dynamics of grief, family obligations, and emotional responses.

The author is experiencing what appears to be emotional numbness or detachment following a traumatic family loss. This could be a form of shock, a psychological defense mechanism, or potentially an underlying condition affecting their emotional processing. Importantly, people process grief very differently - there's no ""correct"" way to grieve.

However, the core issue isn't about the author's emotional response (which they may not be able to control), but about their choice regarding attending the funeral. Funerals serve multiple purposes beyond personal grief - they provide support to other grieving family members, honor the deceased, and maintain family bonds during difficult times.

The author's father and sister are clearly in pain and have explicitly asked for their presence and support. The author's stated reason for not attending (""I have a lot going on right now"") appears insufficient given the magnitude of the loss and the family's needs. Even if the author doesn't feel personal grief, they could still recognize the importance of supporting their grieving family members.

While I have some sympathy for the author's emotional state, their decision to prioritize personal convenience over family support during a crisis shows a lack of consideration for others' needs.

The author provided housing to a friend in need and dealt with abandoned property in a reasonable manner. After the friend moved out without notice and left belongings behind for 8 months (including guns that made the author uncomfortable), the author made a good faith effort to handle the situation. When they discovered the TV actually belonged to the friend's ex-girlfriend, they facilitated its return to the rightful owner. The author also repeatedly asked about the guns due to safety concerns before the friend finally retrieved them.

The friend showed poor judgment and responsibility by: moving out without notice, abandoning property for 8 months, leaving guns with someone uncomfortable having them, and then getting angry when consequences followed their neglect.

However, there's a legitimate argument that the author should have made more direct contact with the friend before giving away what they believed to be his property, even after 8 months. While the author's actions were understandable and largely reasonable, a brief attempt to contact the friend about the TV specifically would have been the more careful approach.

The friend bears primary responsibility for creating this situation through abandonment and poor communication, but the author could have handled the final step slightly better.

The author made a responsible choice prioritizing their career goals. They initially committed to summer plans with Ben only after believing the internship opportunity had fallen through (no responses for a month). When an unexpected opportunity arose, they chose their future over immediate fun - a mature decision for a 14-year-old. They communicated the change to Ben promptly and honestly.

Ben's reaction, while disappointing, is understandable for a 15-year-old who was looking forward to shared summer plans. His comments about ""pouring coffee"" show some dismissiveness of the author's goals, but this seems more like typical teenage perspective than serious wrongdoing.

The professor was very late in responding (over a month), which created this conflict, but academic timelines can be unpredictable and this doesn't seem malicious.

This appears to be a natural conflict between friendship and personal ambition - something many people face. The author handled it maturely by being honest and making a decision aligned with their values. Ben's disappointment is valid but doesn't make the author's choice wrong. Sometimes life circumstances create disappointing situations without anyone being truly at fault.

She wasn't really raised in I...",Author,Everybody,0.8,0.7623762376237624,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives and actions of both parties.

The author's concerns about cultural appropriation and superficial incorporation of Hindu/Indian traditions have some validity. It can be genuinely problematic when sacred or meaningful cultural elements are treated as aesthetic choices without understanding their significance. The author was trying to protect their cultural heritage from what they perceived as misuse.

However, the author's approach was quite harsh and dismissive. Telling someone they ""shouldn't have an Indian wedding"" because they ""don't understand it"" completely disregards Jenn's complex identity as an adopted person trying to connect with her birth culture. The author failed to recognize that Jenn's relationship to Indian culture, while different from their own, is still legitimate given her heritage.

Jenn's response - breaking down, ending the friendship, and cutting off communication - seems disproportionate to receiving honest feedback from a close friend, even if it was delivered poorly. While her feelings about adoption and cultural connection are valid, completely shutting out someone who was trying (albeit clumsily) to help her navigate cultural sensitivity shows an inability to handle constructive criticism.

Both parties acted problematically: the author was insensitive to the complexities of adopted identity and cultural reconnection, while Jenn overreacted and ended the friendship rather than engaging in dialogue about how to honor the culture more meaningfully.

You and your friends meant well trying to help your depressed friend, but directly messaging the girl on his behalf was problematic for several reasons:
- It violated his autonomy and potentially embarrassed him
- It put the girl in an uncomfortable position she didn't ask for
- It could have damaged his reputation and chances with her
- Most people prefer to handle their own romantic situations

However, this seems like a genuine mistake made by well-meaning teenagers who were worried about their friend's mental health. The intent was to help, not harm, and you're showing remorse and self-reflection about the outcome.

Your friend isn't at fault for having feelings or depression, and the girl isn't at fault for being upset about unsolicited messages from strangers about her personal life.

The author has:
- Clearly communicated he's not gay and nothing would happen between them
- Explicitly told P. his behavior was inappropriate after receiving unwanted romantic texts
- Cut contact when boundaries were crossed
- Given P. a second chance when circumstances brought them back together
- Continued to set boundaries about his discomfort with P.'s behavior

P. has consistently:
- Ignored clearly stated boundaries
- Sent inappropriate romantic messages after being told no
- Accused the author of homophobia when called out
- Used manipulation tactics (claiming to be alone/unaccepted)
- Continued pursuing the author even after learning he's in a relationship
- Made public displays that embarrassed the author in front of his girlfriend and strangers
- Physically violated boundaries (forced unwanted hug with inappropriate language)

The author's consideration of going no-contact is a reasonable response to repeated boundary violations. P.'s behavior constitutes harassment regardless of his sexual orientation - this isn't about homophobia, it's about respecting clearly communicated boundaries and consent.

While the author could have been more direct about ending the friendship permanently after the first major incident, his attempts to give P. a second chance and communicate about the problems show good faith effort. P.'s pattern of manipulation and boundary violations is the core issue here.

The author witnessed a serious single-vehicle accident where the driver was clearly intoxicated (slurring words, couldn't stand straight, had alcohol in hand). While the author refused to lie about who was driving - which was the right choice - they then helped the intoxicated driver flee the scene of an accident.

This creates several serious problems:
1. The driver was likely legally required to remain at the scene of the accident
2. By helping him leave, the author potentially aided in obstruction of justice and helped someone evade a DUI charge
3. The intoxicated person could have caused further harm to themselves or others after being dropped off
4. Insurance investigations and police reports would be compromised by the driver's absence
5. There may have been other factors (medical emergency, mechanical failure) that needed investigation

While the author's initial instinct to help and refusal to lie were admirable, the decision to drive the intoxicated person away from the accident scene crossed ethical and likely legal boundaries. The appropriate action would have been to keep the person safe at the scene until emergency responders arrived.

The intoxicated driver bears primary responsibility for driving under the influence and causing the accident, but the author bears responsibility for the poor decision to help them flee.

The girlfriend repeatedly pressed for honest feedback about her appearance, even after the author tried to redirect the conversation to positive topics. When she specifically asked ""what do I like about her,"" he focused on good things. When she pushed further asking ""how could she look better,"" he gave honest feedback. Most critically, when she asked if he thought she could improve her looks, he said no - which actually seems supportive, suggesting he doesn't think she needs to change.

While the author's delivery may have been clumsy, he was put in an extremely difficult position. His girlfriend persistently demanded honesty about a sensitive topic after he tried to avoid it. The ""5/10"" rating is harsh, but that appears to be his internal assessment rather than something he directly told her. His actions (continuing to date her, calling her cute, emphasizing her amazing personality) suggest he genuinely cares about her.

The girlfriend created this situation by repeatedly pressing for feedback she wasn't prepared to hear, despite his attempts to redirect the conversation positively.

You took pre-approved vacation time during what turned out to be an unexpectedly busy period due to weather that couldn't have been predicted. You didn't choose to be away during the crisis - it was just unfortunate timing.

The author's actions show some problematic elements:
- They admit to being deliberately non-committal and avoiding OLG after discovering she didn't match her photos
- They used derogatory language (""Obsessed Landwhale Girl"") which shows disrespectful attitudes
- They could have been more direct about their lack of interest instead of avoiding her

However, OLG's behavior was also inappropriate:
- She apparently spread negative stories about the author to mutual friends before even meeting in person
- She seemed to have unrealistic expectations based on limited conversation
- The ""obsessed"" behavior described suggests she may have been overly invested too quickly

The mutual friends also played a role by pressuring the author to ""give her a chance"" and getting involved in what should have been a personal matter between two people.

The core issue seems to be poor communication and unrealistic expectations on multiple sides, with some inappropriate behavior from OLG (spreading stories) and disrespectful attitudes from the author (the derogatory language and avoidance rather than honest communication).

The author acknowledges they missed rent payments and had an agreement with their roommate about paying it back. The roommate was understanding and flexible about this arrangement. However, the girlfriend moving in around mid-2016 created a new dynamic where she's essentially living there rent-free while the author continues to pay half the total rent.

The key issue is that the author never addressed the rent redistribution when the girlfriend moved in. They allowed this situation to continue for about two years without bringing it up, while simultaneously falling behind on their own rent obligations. Now they want to use the girlfriend's unpaid rent as justification for not paying their own debt.

While the author has a valid point that the living arrangement became unfair when a third person moved in rent-free, they handled this poorly by:
1. Never communicating about the issue when it started
2. Continuing to fall behind on rent payments
3. Only bringing this up now as a way to avoid paying what they owe

The roommate, while benefiting from having his girlfriend live rent-free, was also flexible and understanding about the author's payment issues and trusted them about the amount owed.

The other parent and ...,Author,Author,0.8,0.6181818181818182,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the key factors:

1. Both the child and the other parent want the name change
2. The law now permits this change
3. The author admits having ""no rational argument"" against it
4. The author acknowledges they don't believe it would hurt the child
5. The author has been refusing to sign for 1-2 years based on a ""vague feeling""
6. A 9-year-old is expressing a clear desire to include both parents' names

The author is blocking something that:
- The child actively wants
- The other parent supports
- Is now legally permissible
- The author admits wouldn't be harmful
- Would be inclusive of both parents

While parents certainly have the right to make decisions for their children, refusing to allow a child to honor both parents through their name - especially when admitting there's no rational basis for the refusal - seems unreasonable. The author appears to be letting personal feelings override what could be a positive step for the child's sense of identity and connection to both parents.

The ""she's too young"" concern doesn't hold much weight here since this is about acknowledging family connections, not making a complex life decision, and names can be changed again later if truly necessary.

However, my uncle and aunt despise my new business and have cut me out of their lives. The...",Author,Author,0.85,0.8,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the key issue: selling cannabis to a minor against his parents' explicit wishes.

While I can understand your sympathy for Tom's difficult situation and your intention to help him cope with stress, there are several serious problems with your actions:

1. **Legal issues**: Selling cannabis to a 17-year-old is illegal in most jurisdictions, regardless of your business being legal for adults
2. **Parental authority**: Despite disagreeing with his parents' approach, they still have legal authority over their minor child's medical and substance use decisions
3. **Undermining family relationships**: You knowingly went against his parents' wishes, which predictably caused family conflict
4. **Professional boundaries**: As a cannabis business owner, you should understand the importance of age restrictions and legal compliance

Your uncle and aunt's reaction, while harsh in cutting you out completely, is understandable given that you violated their parental authority and potentially broke the law. Your parents' anger is also justified - even though they support your business, they recognize you crossed an important line.

Tom's difficult family situation is genuinely concerning, but providing him with cannabis wasn't an appropriate solution and created more problems for everyone involved.

The sister consistently insults the author daily for about a year, which is clearly hurtful and inappropriate. The parents enable this behavior by dismissing the author's concerns and seemingly always siding with the younger sibling. However, the author is also escalating the situation by retaliating with petty acts of revenge rather than finding more constructive ways to address the problem.

While the author's frustration is completely understandable given the constant insults and lack of parental support, unplugging the PlayStation (especially during an important update) and then telling family members to ""go fuck off"" represents an escalation that makes the situation worse for everyone.

The parents are failing in their duty to address the sister's insulting behavior and create a respectful household environment. The sister is being cruel with daily insults. The author is responding with retaliation rather than seeking better solutions.

This is a dysfunctional family dynamic where everyone is handling conflict poorly - the sister through insults, the parents through dismissiveness and favoritism, and the author through revenge tactics and explosive responses.

You have a clear recycling option available - it's just less convenient than the trash chute. While the process of taking recyclables down to the parking lot is more effort, it's not an unreasonable burden for someone living in an apartment building. Many people deal with similar inconveniences to recycle properly.

Your guests were right that choosing convenience over environmental responsibility isn't ideal, though their delivery was harsh. However, this is ultimately about personal choices regarding environmental stewardship. You're not violating any building rules or harming others directly - you're making a choice that prioritizes convenience over recycling.

The building setup isn't ideal, but that doesn't eliminate your ability to recycle - it just makes it less convenient. While I understand the frustration with the setup, the option to recycle still exists.

This seems like a situation where you could make a better environmental choice, even if it requires more effort.

The author has legitimate reasons for declining: they just woke up unexpectedly late, already worked 5 consecutive days recently covering for others, need time off, have their own plans, and reasonably expect more advance notice for shift coverage requests. Their boundary of wanting 1-2 days notice is reasonable for work-life balance.

The coworker made a last-minute request (same day, asking at 10am for a 5pm shift) without providing details about urgency, which suggests it may not be an emergency. While offering transportation was considerate, it doesn't obligate the author to accept.

The author was polite in declining and explained their reasoning. They've been helpful in the past by covering shifts, showing they're generally a team player. Setting boundaries about advance notice is healthy and reasonable.

Neither party appears to have done anything wrong here. The coworker can ask for coverage, and the author can reasonably decline, especially given the short notice and their recent work history. This seems like a normal workplace interaction where someone made a request and received a polite decline.

The partner's mental health struggles don't make them inherently ""at fault"" either - mental illness isn't a choice. However, consistently refusing help while negatively impacting a relationship for years does create some responsibility.

Your friend is clearly trying to help and care for you, which comes from a good place. However, her approach - using a childlike voice and being overly protective - is understandably frustrating and potentially counterproductive to your wellbeing.

You did try to communicate that you were fine, but it seems like you may not have been direct enough initially about how her specific behaviors were affecting you. When you finally did speak up directly, the delivery was quite harsh (""treating me like a disabled child"") which likely hurt her feelings, even though your underlying point was valid.

Your friend means well but isn't respecting your boundaries or treating you with the dignity you deserve. You have legitimate concerns but could have expressed them more constructively.

This seems like a case where both people made mistakes - she by not listening to your boundaries and treating you in a patronizing way, and you by letting frustration build up and then expressing your needs in a hurtful manner rather than having a calm, direct conversation earlier.

I was venting abo...,Author,Other,0.75,0.8571428571428571,True,"Looking at this conversation, I can see both sides made some missteps in communication.

The friend was trying to be helpful by offering what they saw as constructive advice after the author was venting about their romantic situation. Their intention appears genuine - they were responding to someone who seemed to be in pain and no one else had replied.

However, the author made it very clear they wanted emotional support, not advice or lessons. Their response, while firm, was actually quite thoughtful - they explained their boundaries, acknowledged their own process, and clarified what kind of support they needed.

The friend then responded defensively, saying it ""rubs me the wrong way to have it taken in such a negative way."" This suggests they took the boundary-setting personally rather than understanding that the author was simply communicating their needs during a vulnerable time.

The author's initial boundary-setting was appropriate and well-communicated. The friend's defensive reaction and apparent inability to accept that their well-intentioned advice wasn't what was needed shows a lack of emotional awareness in this situation.

While both parties could have handled aspects of this better, the friend's defensive response to reasonable boundary-setting is the primary issue here.

While you mention Rebecca isn't secretive about her conservative views and the university setting naturally involves political discussion, there's an important distinction between someone choosing to share their own political beliefs and having someone else announce them to a class. Even if Rebecca displays her political views in private settings (like your shared living space), that doesn't give you the right to ""out"" her political affiliation in an academic setting without her permission.

The fact that you felt the anecdote was ""relevant and funny"" suggests you didn't consider how Rebecca might feel about having her political identity announced to the class. In a heavily liberal environment, as you acknowledge, there can be social consequences for conservative students. Rebecca's reaction - feeling ""humiliated and isolated"" - indicates this disclosure genuinely affected her negatively.

Your recognition that you ""should not volunteer information about other people that they may not be comfortable with becoming public"" shows you understand the core issue. While your intent wasn't malicious, the impact on Rebecca was real and harmful.

The appropriate action would have been to either volunteer for the roles without personal anecdotes, or to ask Rebecca privately beforehand if she was comfortable with you sharing that information.

I had been seeing this ...",Other,Everybody,0.8,0.7226277372262774,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the actions and expectations of both parties.

The author made some reasonable assumptions based on the relationship's progression - spending 3-4 nights a week together for 1.5 months, intimate behaviors at the party initially, and being invited to help set up suggest a level of commitment. However, the girlfriend is technically correct that they never explicitly discussed exclusivity.

The key issues are:
1. The girlfriend's behavior was inconsiderate - completely ignoring someone you've been intimately involved with to make out with another person at a party is hurtful, regardless of relationship status
2. The author's reaction, while understandable given the emotional shock and alcohol, was inappropriate - yelling and causing a scene at her birthday party in front of her friends was an overreaction
3. Both parties failed to communicate properly about their relationship expectations

The girlfriend showed poor judgment and lack of empathy, but the author's public outburst was disproportionate and embarrassing for everyone involved. A mature response would have been to leave quietly and address it privately later.

Both parties contributed to this situation through poor communication and inappropriate behavior.

The author is not at fault here. She's a minor who has endured relentless bullying about her appearance and antisemitic treatment. Her desire for a nose job comes from a place of pain and wanting to feel normal and accepted - completely understandable feelings for a teenager. She's not rejecting her Jewish identity; she explicitly states she considers herself Jewish both culturally and religiously. She simply wants relief from the harassment she faces.

The parents, while their concerns about heritage and not giving in to bullies come from a place of love and principle, are being unsupportive when their daughter needs them most. Giving her the cold shoulder over this request is particularly hurtful. They seem to be prioritizing their ideological stance over their daughter's emotional wellbeing.

The real fault lies with the bullies, antisemites, and the broader community that has made this young woman feel so unwelcome and unsafe that she wants to change her appearance. However, since the question asks about the people directly involved in this conflict (author vs. parents), the parents bear responsibility for their unsupportive response.

This is a complex situation involving identity, bullying, and family dynamics, but the teenager seeking relief from harassment is not the one at fault.

The author seems to feel that their wife copying songs from their carefully curated playlist somehow diminishes their ownership or uniqueness of those songs. However, music is inherently meant to be shared, and in a marriage, sharing favorite discoveries is typically seen as a positive thing. The wife following her husband on Spotify and adding songs she likes to her own playlist is normal behavior on the platform.

The author's request for the wife to delete songs or reorder them suggests they want to maintain some kind of exclusive control over music they've discovered, which seems unreasonable in a marriage context. The wife's anger appears justified - she's being asked to remove songs she enjoys from her own playlist simply because her husband found them first.

The author's framing of wanting the wife to ""find her own music"" treats music discovery as territorial rather than collaborative, which seems contrary to the spirit of sharing music together that they describe enjoying.

While I can understand feeling some pride in curation, demanding that a spouse modify their personal playlist to preserve one's sense of musical uniqueness crosses into controlling behavior.

The boyfriend's behavior is deeply concerning and dangerous:
- Getting heavily intoxicated while caring for a 1-year-old child
- Drinking in the bathtub to the point of nearly drowning/passing out
- Having a previous serious injury from the same dangerous behavior
- Dismissing the author's legitimate safety concerns
- Creating an unsafe environment for both his partner and child

The author's response, while understandable given the extreme stress and fear of watching her partner nearly drown, involved pouring beer on him - which was not an appropriate way to handle the situation, even in crisis.

However, the core issue here is the boyfriend's dangerous drinking behavior that puts everyone at risk. The author is dealing with sleep deprivation from caring for their sick child, legitimate safety fears, and a partner who continues extremely risky behavior despite previous serious consequences (breaking his face). Her reaction, while not ideal, came from a place of desperation trying to prevent him from drowning.

The boyfriend bears primary responsibility for creating this dangerous situation through his drinking choices, especially given the presence of a young child and his history of alcohol-related injuries.

The author initiated the breakup due to personal struggles with depression and adjustment to college life. While understandable, breaking up via message after a 3-year relationship was hurtful. More significantly, despite the ex-girlfriend clearly stating she wanted no contact, the author continued to reach out multiple times over two years, ignoring her explicit boundary.

The ex-girlfriend's response may have seemed cold, but she has the right to process the breakup in her own way and to establish boundaries about contact. Her request to stop contacting her was clear and reasonable.

The author is still considering reaching out again despite acknowledging she likely blocked him and hasn't responded in over a year. This shows a continued disregard for her clearly expressed wishes for no contact.

While the initial breakup was understandable given the author's mental health struggles, the repeated attempts to contact someone who has explicitly asked to be left alone crosses into problematic territory. The ex-girlfriend has done nothing wrong by maintaining her boundaries.

This is a pattern of behavior where he repeatedly takes the author's belongings without permission, despite being told no.

The key issues:
1. **Established boundary violation**: The author previously told him they weren't comfortable lending the electric eraser, yet he took it anyway
2. **Physical grabbing**: He yanked the study notes out of the author's hands without asking
3. **Poor timing**: This happened minutes before an exam when both students needed to study
4. **Dismissive attitude**: When confronted, he told the author to ""chill"" rather than acknowledging the inappropriate behavior

The author handled this reasonably by:
- Setting clear boundaries initially
- Explaining their position calmly
- Standing up for themselves when those boundaries were crossed
- Being willing to share under better circumstances (mentioning they would have let him borrow it if there was more time)

The author's study notes represent hours of personal work, and no one is entitled to take someone else's property, especially during a high-stress moment right before an exam. The classmate's behavior shows a pattern of disrespecting boundaries and taking things without permission.

While the author's request is indeed quick (5 seconds) and doesn't interfere with the clerk helping the current customer, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Line etiquette and fairness**: Everyone in line is waiting for postal services, regardless of how long their transaction takes. Some people in line might also have quick requests.

2. **Setting precedent**: If everyone with ""quick"" requests bypassed the line, it would create chaos and unfairness for those waiting properly.

3. **Assumptions about others**: The author assumes others have longer transactions, but some people in line might also just need quick services like passport pickups, package retrievals, or other brief interactions.

2. **Requesting nudes**: Asking for nude photos from someone who had already expressed discomfort is inappropriate and potentially illegal given their age.

3. **Cruel response to rejection**: When she declined to send photos, calling the entire interaction ""disgusting"" was unnecessarily hurtful and manipulative.

While the situation involved two people and both were drinking, the author's actions after the initial consensual contact - ignoring her verbal boundary, requesting inappropriate photos, and then being cruel when rejected - represent clear violations of consent and respect.

The author broke up with their girlfriend for legitimate relationship reasons (feeling the relationship was one-sided) before the ex came out as nonbinary. However, the timing created an unfortunate appearance that the breakup was related to the coming out, leading to misunderstandings among their social circle.

The ex then actively spread rumors claiming the breakup was due to transphobia, which was false and damaged the author's reputation and friendships. This was a deliberate misrepresentation that caused real harm.

The author's response, while understandable given the frustration of being falsely accused and losing friendships, crossed a clear line. Making transphobic comments like ""You're not special you are just a tomboy"" was hurtful and wrong, regardless of the provocation.

Both parties made significant mistakes: the ex spread false rumors that damaged relationships, and the author responded with genuinely hurtful, transphobic language. The ex's actions don't justify the author's response, and the author's hurt feelings don't excuse making transphobic comments.

The server owner has legitimate authority over their Discord server - this is both a technical reality and generally accepted practice. They also have a valid personal reason (the word triggers memories of a ""dark time"") for wanting to avoid this content in their space.

However, the owner's approach seems problematic in several ways:
- Initially implementing censorship without explanation to friends
- Being ""reluctant"" to provide reasoning when questioned
- Refusing to remove the automated filter even after friends acknowledged the issue and promised to self-monitor
- Not trusting friends to honor their commitment to be more considerate

The friends' frustration is understandable - they feel their communication is being unnecessarily restricted by an automated system when they've already agreed to be mindful of the owner's feelings.

While the owner has the technical right to moderate their server however they choose, continuing to use an automated filter after friends have shown understanding and made commitments suggests either a lack of trust in the friendship or an overly controlling approach to a shared social space.

The most reasonable solution would be removing the filter while trusting friends to keep their word, with the understanding that if the word becomes problematic again, other solutions could be explored.

The author clearly acknowledges being emotionally abusive in the past relationship - demanding money, threatening abandonment, making false accusations, and manipulating their ex-boyfriend when they were 12. This caused significant emotional damage.

This was actually the right thing to say given their history and the author's apparent lack of romantic feelings.

The ex-boyfriend's extreme emotional reaction - kneeling, crying, begging - while understandable given the trauma from their past relationship, was his own response to rejection. The author didn't encourage this behavior or manipulate the situation. They simply declined to rekindle the relationship, which was their right to do.

Cruella's behavior is clearly problematic - being disrespectful, disobeying direct orders, refusing to provide timely reports that cost the company money, and being rude to ownership/partners. These are legitimate grounds for termination in most workplace contexts.

However, the author's plan to fire her ""without pay"" - withholding both severance and her final month's wages - crosses an ethical line. While the author may have legal grounds to fire Cruella (especially with weak labor laws), withholding earned wages for work already performed is fundamentally wrong, regardless of her behavior. Severance might be discretionary, but wages for work completed are earned compensation.

The author's motivation also seems partially driven by personal vindictiveness (""I truly want to punish her"") rather than purely business considerations. While firing her may be justified, the manner of doing so appears retaliatory.

The uncle enabled this situation by playing favorites and not addressing legitimate management concerns, but that doesn't justify the author's proposed unethical response.

You had legitimate concerns about political content in what should be an apolitical municipal space. However, your response escalated beyond reasonable criticism in several problematic ways:

1. You publicly mocked and ""trashed talked"" an educational exhibit, which could be seen as disrespectful regardless of political disagreement
2. When someone took issue with your public posts, you escalated by creating another post attacking communists as people rather than just the ideology
3. Most significantly, you named a specific individual and called them a ""commie asshole"" - this crossed into personal attack territory, especially since you included unrelated serious allegations about sexual misconduct

While you deleted the naming post, the damage was done. Your friend's upset reaction seems reasonable given that you publicly attacked someone in her social circle and made broad character judgments about people with certain political views.

Your right to disagree with political content doesn't extend to personal attacks on individuals or making sweeping negative generalizations about groups of people. The situation escalated primarily due to your increasingly aggressive responses rather than sticking to substantive criticism of the exhibit itself.

Later in t...,Other,Everybody,0.8,0.6666666666666666,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the social dynamics and expectations involved.

Your friend publicly declared his intention to pursue this woman, which created a reasonable expectation among the friend group that he was ""calling dibs"" so to speak. While this doesn't give him ownership over her or guarantee anything would happen, it does establish a social understanding that he was interested and planning to make a move.

However, several factors complicate this:
- The woman is an autonomous person who can choose who she wants to be with
- Your friend got himself kicked out of the bar, removing himself from the situation
- There was no prior relationship or established connection between them
- She chose to hook up with you

The core issue is that you knew your friend's intentions and proceeded anyway without any discussion or consideration of how this might affect your friendship. While you didn't technically do anything ""wrong"" in terms of the woman's autonomy, you did violate an understood social expectation within your friend group.

This appears to be a situation where both parties bear some responsibility - your friend for his reaction and you for not considering the social dynamics at play.

The key issues here are:
- The mother takes money without asking (sometimes all of it)
- She doesn't return it unless repeatedly reminded
- She took money specifically saved for a known goal (the Kindle)
- She has money for personal purchases and habits but claims she can't return borrowed money
- This creates a double standard compared to how the father handles borrowing

The money was given to the author by relatives specifically to ""treat herself,"" making it legitimately hers regardless of whether she ""earned"" it through work. The author has been patient, understanding of family financial pressures, and has tried subtle approaches to resolve this.

The mother's behavior shows a lack of respect for her daughter's property and savings goals. Taking money without asking, not returning it promptly, and prioritizing her own wants (shoes, dress, cigarettes, beer) over repaying her daughter demonstrates poor financial boundaries and parenting in this regard.

The author's anger is completely justified, and confronting her mother about this would be appropriate and necessary.

She was destroying a meaningful gift from a child's mother - including photos of just the daughter and her biological mother - while the 5-year-old was pleading with her to stop because ""she worked so hard on that.""

The author handled this correctly by:
- Immediately stopping the destruction
- Recognizing the importance of preserving his daughter's connection to her biological mother
- Storing the photos appropriately for his daughter's future
- Trying to help his girlfriend understand through empathy (asking how she'd feel if her stepmother had done this)

The girlfriend's behavior shows concerning issues:
- Destroying a child's precious memories while the child begged her to stop
- Wanting to erase all evidence of the biological mother's existence
- Prioritizing her own jealousy/insecurity over the child's emotional wellbeing
- Failing to understand that a 5-year-old needs to maintain connection to her biological mother, regardless of custody arrangements

Even if the girlfriend has been doing a great job as a stepmother, this particular action crosses a clear line. Children need to maintain their identity and connection to their biological parents when possible, and destroying these memories could cause lasting psychological harm.

The author is presenting philosophical views about:
- Disease and cancer serving as population control mechanisms
- Supporting China's one-child policy
- Believing humanity doesn't ""deserve"" cures until population is controlled
- Suggesting that human suffering from illness serves a beneficial purpose

While the author acknowledges their views might be hurtful to those who have lost loved ones to disease, they're still choosing to express these views in what appears to be a public forum. The author is essentially arguing that human suffering and death from disease is beneficial or necessary, which is likely to cause significant emotional harm to many people, particularly those who have experienced loss.

The author shows some awareness that their views could be hurtful but proceeds anyway. This represents a choice to prioritize expressing controversial philosophical positions over considering the emotional impact on others who might read these views.

However, this appears to be presented as a philosophical discussion rather than targeted harassment of specific individuals.

The author is a high school student who feels left out because their parents are spending significant money ($1200/month) on private school for their grade 3 sister who has apparent dyslexia and is struggling academically. The author admits they don't struggle with grades but still wants to attend private school for the prestige and potential benefits.

The parents' decision appears to be based on genuine educational need - their younger daughter is struggling significantly and requires specialized support that she wasn't receiving in public schools. The author, by their own admission, is doing well academically and has never needed help with schoolwork.

While the author's feelings of being overlooked are understandable human emotions, their reasoning reveals some problematic thinking:
1. They want private school primarily for resume prestige rather than educational necessity
2. They're comparing their situation to a sibling with learning difficulties
3. They acknowledge this might be selfish but still feel entitled to the same treatment

The parents are making reasonable decisions based on each child's individual needs. Equal treatment doesn't always mean identical treatment - it means giving each child what they need to succeed. The author is essentially asking for expensive resources they don't need while their sister requires specialized support.

The author is asking basic questions about her boyfriend's whereabouts and who he's with - this is generally considered normal communication between partners living together. Knowing where your partner is and having some idea of their social activities is typically part of healthy relationship transparency, especially when living together.

The boyfriend's response seems unnecessarily secretive and defensive. While everyone deserves some privacy, completely refusing to share who you're spending time with when directly asked by a live-in partner is unusual and would understandably create concern. His statement that she has ""no right to know"" where he is or who he's with is quite extreme for a committed relationship where they're cohabiting.

The author's request appears reasonable - she's not demanding to join or control his activities, just asking for basic information that most partners would freely share. Her concern about the secrecy is a natural response.

However, the boyfriend's extreme defensiveness and refusal to share even basic information about his social activities suggests he may be hiding something or has unhealthy boundaries around transparency in the relationship.

The packa...,Author,Author,0.8,0.875,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider both the cheese consumption and the reaction to her anger.

Regarding eating the cheese: The package was sent to both of you as a couple, and there was no prior communication about sharing limits or her attachment to this specific cheese. You reasonably assumed it was for both of you to enjoy. The fact that she had been talking about eating healthy could understandably lead someone to think she wasn't particularly interested in the cheese.

However, the main issue here is your reaction when she expressed her upset feelings. Even if her anger seemed disproportionate to you, laughing at your partner when they're genuinely upset is dismissive and hurtful. It doesn't matter if you found the situation amusing - when someone you care about is distressed, the appropriate response is to listen and try to understand, not to laugh at them.

Your fiancé may have overreacted to the cheese situation, but her feelings were real. Your laughter likely made her feel mocked and unheard, which could escalate any underlying issues about consideration or communication in your relationship.

The cheese consumption itself seems like an honest misunderstanding, but laughing at her distress shows a lack of empathy and emotional awareness.

You were upfront about your limitations from the start - you knew staying out past a certain time would be risky for your ability to drive safely home. When the movie time turned out to be later than expected, you offered a reasonable compromise (hanging out until the movie starts), but she declined. Her alternative suggestion (renting a movie at home) would still keep you out just as late, defeating the purpose of addressing your fatigue concerns.

Most importantly, you're prioritizing safety - both yours and others on the road. Driving while severely fatigued, especially with a condition like mono, is genuinely dangerous.

Your girlfriend's reaction seems to show a lack of understanding about the severity of your condition. While disappointment is understandable, giving you attitude and accusing you of not wanting to spend time with her when you're clearly trying to balance your health with the relationship is unfair.

3. You haven't discussed this with Bill
4. You're considering pursuing someone your friend is interested in without his knowledge

While there's no formal ""dibs"" system in dating, and the server is free to choose whoever she wants, friendship dynamics matter. Bill shared his attraction with you, presumably trusting that information. Going behind his back to ask her out, especially knowing he's interested but struggles with approaching people, would likely damage your friendship.

The respectful approach would be to talk to Bill first - either encourage him to ask her out himself, or have an honest conversation about your own interest. This gives him a chance to either act on his feelings or give his perspective on the situation.

The author was dealing with severe anxiety that was causing physical illness and causing them to miss school. They recognized they weren't ready for a relationship and needed to address their mental health first.

The author acknowledges several key points that work in their favor:
- They recognize they ""shouldn't intrude into people's lives""
- They admit they're ""not a parent"" and don't ""normally have to deal with kids""

The author expressed a legitimate preference about communication, and the person they're dating acknowledged it and said they'd try to improve. However, falling asleep while texting is often genuinely unintentional - people don't typically plan to fall asleep mid-conversation. The fact that this happens 80% of the time suggests it's likely not deliberate disregard but rather a natural sleep pattern or habit that's difficult to change.

While the author's feelings are valid, expecting someone to consistently remember to say goodnight when they're literally falling asleep may be somewhat unrealistic. Sleep often comes unexpectedly, and when someone is genuinely tired, their last conscious thought isn't always about sending a text.

The other person did acknowledge the concern and said they'd try, which shows good faith effort. The continued pattern likely reflects the difficulty of changing an unconscious behavior rather than intentional disrespect.

The passenger with the window seat has a legitimate right to control their window shade - this is generally accepted airline etiquette and policy. They also have a reasonable need to have light for reading during what is daytime in their departure timezone. The flight attendant correctly stated they cannot force a passenger to close their window shade, as this aligns with standard airline policies.

While the author's request was made politely initially, continuing to press the issue after being told no crosses into problematic territory. The author is essentially asking someone to give up their legitimate right to natural light for reading so others can sleep during daytime hours.

The old passenger's reaction of going ""0-100 with a rant"" was unnecessarily aggressive, but their underlying position - that they have the right to keep their window open during daytime for reading - is correct.

The core issue here is a conflict between daytime activities (reading) and nighttime activities (sleeping) occurring simultaneously due to timezone differences. In such situations, passengers generally need to adapt with personal solutions (eye masks, etc.) rather than expecting others to accommodate their sleep schedules during daytime hours.

This silent treatment in response to her vulnerability likely felt like abandonment and confirmed her fears about not being a priority.

The girlfriend's frustration and ultimate decision to end the relationship appears to be a reasonable response to weeks of unmet needs and feeling deprioritized. While her ""blowing up"" wasn't ideal, her core message about wanting to feel valued in the relationship was valid.

The author seems to want to maintain a relationship without putting in the necessary effort, which isn't realistic for any relationship, especially a long-distance one.

While your group's concern for your friend's health comes from a caring place, the approach of repeatedly taking and throwing away his personal property crosses important boundaries. Even though you're all teenagers and he's engaging in an unhealthy habit, he has the right to make his own choices about his body and possessions.

The key issues here are:
- Taking someone's belongings without permission, even with good intentions
- Ignoring his clear requests to stop (""give it back"" and expressing that ""it really pisses him off"")
- The ineffectiveness of this approach (he just buys new ones and continues smoking)
- The pattern of disrespecting his autonomy despite your friendship

Your friend is engaging in an unhealthy behavior, but that doesn't justify repeatedly taking his property. There are more respectful ways to express concern, like honest conversations about your worries for his health.

The fact that you're questioning whether this was wrong shows good self-reflection, and that you remain good friends suggests he values the relationship despite these incidents.

The author has legitimate trauma from an abusive relationship and has repeatedly communicated their discomfort with their friend maintaining contact with the abuser. They've been clear about their boundaries and ultimately decided to end the friendship when those boundaries weren't respected. The author isn't trying to control who M can be friends with - they're making a personal choice about what relationships they can maintain for their own wellbeing.

M, on the other hand, has the right to choose her own friends, but her handling of this situation is problematic. She initially seemed to understand the severity of the abuse, yet continued the friendship anyway. More concerning is her justification that the friendship is valid because T ""reached out to her in college"" while the author didn't - this essentially blames the author for not maintaining contact during a normal period of life transition. Her response when confronted was defensive and dismissive of her friend's trauma.

While M technically has the right to be friends with anyone, her approach lacks empathy and understanding of abuse dynamics. The author's decision to end the friendship is a reasonable boundary, not controlling behavior.

The author handled this maturely by communicating their feelings multiple times and ultimately making a decision that protects their mental health rather than trying to force M to change.

The author received tickets as a Christmas gift intended for her and her boyfriend to enjoy together. She's in a long-distance relationship where quality time is limited and precious. She has legitimate concerns about not being able to enjoy the experience or have meaningful couple time if they're supervising a 10-year-old, especially given her discomfort around children (which her boyfriend knows about).

The boyfriend wanting to include his sister isn't inherently wrong - he likely wants to share something fun with family. However, he's essentially changing the nature of what was meant to be a romantic gift without discussing it with his girlfriend first.

The key issue is that this was a gift specifically for the couple, and unilaterally deciding to bring a third party (especially a child requiring supervision) fundamentally changes the experience. The author would be reasonable to express her preference that they go as originally intended.

While the boyfriend's desire to include his sister comes from a good place, he should have discussed this change with his girlfriend first, given that it significantly alters their plans and the nature of their limited time together.

The author asking to keep it as originally planned - a couple's outing - is not unreasonable given the circumstances.

We will call them S and K...,Other,Author,0.8,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I can see valid points on multiple sides, but there are some key issues with how you're handling this.

You have a legitimate grievance - you were misled about the garage arrangement for 3 years, believing S&K paid extra when they didn't. That's unfair, and you deserve equal access to shared amenities you're paying for.

However, your approach is problematic:

1. **Withholding the garage opener as ""collateral""** - This is manipulative and escalates the conflict unnecessarily. They paid for it, so it's theirs regardless of the parking discussion.

2. **Moving into the garage while they were away without prior agreement** - While understandable given your frustration, this was presumptuous and created the current standoff.

3. **Demanding exclusive use** - After 3 years of them having established use, immediately jumping to ""I want the spot just for me"" rather than starting with a reasonable sharing arrangement seems unrealistic.

Your roommates aren't blameless - they should have been upfront about costs from the beginning and been more considerate about sharing. But your current tactics (holding the opener hostage, parking without permission) are counterproductive.

The mature approach would be: return their property, have an honest conversation about fair sharing arrangements, and work toward a compromise that acknowledges both your legitimate claim to equal access and their established use patterns.

Your aunt's behavior was clearly inappropriate - making passive-aggressive comments loud enough for you to hear, calling you names like ""IT nerd,"" and trying to manipulate you into providing free tech support after you'd explicitly set boundaries. She was being disrespectful and trying to publicly shame you.

However, your response crossed several lines. While your anger was completely understandable given the history, calling her a ""massive entitled cunt"" and saying you hope to ""never see her disgusting face again"" in front of family members (including your grandmother) was excessive. You also disrupted your uncle's birthday celebration, which affected innocent family members.

The core issue - setting boundaries around unpaid tech support - was completely valid. Your frustration with years of being taken advantage of was justified. But the way you expressed that frustration caused collateral damage to relationships with family members who weren't part of the problem.

You had other options: you could have left immediately, addressed her comments more calmly, or even confronted her privately later. The nuclear option you chose, while emotionally satisfying in the moment, created new problems and hurt people you care about.

The author admits to:

- Leading the girl on by saying they'd talk when issues were resolved, knowing they never intended to
- Being emotionally intimate with someone who had strong feelings while being ""on the fence""
- Choosing deception over honest communication to avoid a difficult conversation

While it's completely valid to lose interest in someone and want to end contact, the author chose manipulation over honesty. A simple, direct conversation saying ""I've realized we're not compatible and I'd like to end our romantic connection"" would have been much more respectful than fabricating personal issues and false hope for future reconciliation.

The girl doesn't appear to have done anything wrong - having strong feelings and being emotionally available isn't a fault. The author even acknowledges that saying ""piss off, leave me alone"" would be rude, yet their chosen approach was arguably more cruel because it was dishonest and gave false hope.

The author made a significant error in judgment by proposing with a ring from a previous engagement without disclosing this to his fiancée beforehand. This is a major breach of trust and transparency in what should be one of the most meaningful moments in their relationship. Even with financial constraints, he had options - he could have sold the ring and used those funds toward a new one, or at minimum, been completely honest about the ring's history before proposing. His attempt to romanticize the decision (""this is the girl that should have had it all along"") doesn't excuse the deception.

The ex-girlfriend's decision to contact the fiancée directly on social media was inappropriate and seems motivated by a desire to cause drama rather than genuine concern. She could have addressed this privately with the author first if she felt it was truly important.

However, the core issue here is the author's lack of honesty with his fiancée about something that would obviously matter deeply to her. Most people would want to know if their engagement ring had been previously given to another partner, and they deserve the right to make an informed decision about accepting it.

The hitchhiker was sharing what appears to be a traumatic experience - being raped. While this may have made for an uncomfortable conversation, sharing trauma doesn't inherently threaten the driver's safety. There's no indication she was behaving aggressively, making threats, or acting in a way that would reasonably suggest she intended to make false accusations.

The author's response - abandoning someone in what appears to be a remote location during a long-distance journey - was disproportionate to the perceived threat. This action potentially put the hitchhiker in genuine danger, stranding someone who may have been vulnerable and dealing with recent trauma.

While I can understand feeling uncomfortable with unexpected personal revelations from a stranger, the author's fear of false accusation appears to have been based on assumptions rather than any actual threatening behavior. The decision to abandon someone roadside represents a significant escalation that could have had serious consequences for the hitchhiker's safety.

The author is dealing with rejection in a way that immediately cuts off all contact, including blocking someone after what appears to be a friendship. While protecting one's emotional well-being is understandable, the approach shows some concerning patterns - viewing romantic rejection as being ""shit on,"" seeing friendships with women primarily through a romantic lens, and using language that suggests he doesn't value women as individuals beyond romantic potential.

However, the friend who confronted him also handled things poorly by getting ""in his face"" rather than having a respectful conversation about how her friend was hurt.

The woman who was blocked may have done nothing wrong - romantic rejection is normal and healthy when someone isn't interested, and she may have genuinely valued the friendship.

The core issue seems to be a fundamental mismatch in how relationships and rejection are viewed. The author appears to struggle with seeing women as complete individuals worthy of friendship regardless of romantic potential, while also dealing with what sounds like painful repeated rejection.

The author admits to being ""an asshole"" when sharing their personal experience, and this self-awareness is telling. While the author may have had good intentions in trying to help their friend understand a potential pattern, the way they handled it was problematic. They projected their own past behavior and motivations onto their friend's girlfriend without any evidence that she shares those same intentions. This created unnecessary doubt and anxiety in their friend's mind about a relationship that may have been perfectly healthy.

The friend's insecurity is understandable but not necessarily justified - people often look happier and more attractive in photos when they're in good relationships. The girlfriend appears to have done nothing wrong - posting attractive photos on social media is normal behavior and doesn't indicate infidelity or wanting to leave the relationship.

The author's approach of sharing their own story of essentially using improved photos to attract other people while in a relationship, then suggesting this might be exactly what's happening with the girlfriend, was unnecessarily damaging.

The brother-in-law's response to the iPad reset was completely disproportionate. Resetting a used device before giving it to a child is standard practice for security and privacy reasons. His aggressive demands for immediate fixes, rude voicemails claiming the husband ""ruined his son's life,"" and threats to return the gift at their expense show extremely poor judgment and entitlement.

The broader pattern is even more telling: constant complaints about gifts not being ""right,"" demands for cash instead of thoughtful presents, criticism for not attending every event while never reciprocating visits, and blame for circumstances beyond their control (like mail theft). The fact that the other godmother also cut contact suggests this is a recurring pattern of unreasonable behavior from the brother-in-law and his wife.

While the husband's decision to end the godparent relationship was abrupt and affects an innocent child, it appears to be a reasonable response to sustained mistreatment and impossible expectations.

- They have separate emergency funds that remain untouched
- They're using a dedicated savings fund specifically for the wedding
- Both partners genuinely want a traditional wedding celebration
- The parents are pressuring them to elope and spend the money on their daughter instead

The parents' criticism seems to stem from the belief that any ""extra"" money should automatically go to the child rather than the parents' own desires. However, this perspective has some flaws:

",Author,Nobody,0.8,0.8571428571428571,True,"This situation describes someone expressing frustration about a lack of constructive criticism in what appears to be an online community, with the concern that people avoid giving feedback due to fear of being downvoted.

This seems to be describing a systemic issue with online community dynamics rather than pointing to any specific wrongdoing by individuals. The author is making an observation about community behavior patterns, and there's no indication that anyone has acted inappropriately. The reluctance to give constructive criticism due to fear of negative reactions is a common phenomenon in online spaces, and it's not necessarily anyone's ""fault"" - it's more of a natural consequence of how voting/rating systems can sometimes discourage honest feedback.

Without more specific details about particular incidents or behaviors, this appears to be commentary on general community dynamics rather than a situation where fault needs to be assigned.

However, there are issues with how this was handled by multiple parties.

You were dealing with a traumatic situation that understandably affected your ability to focus on homework. That's a legitimate concern. However, the email you sent to your teacher was disrespectful in tone and approach. Phrases like ""I really don't know man"" and the overall confrontational style were inappropriate for communicating with a teacher, even when you're upset. There were better ways to explain your situation - perhaps speaking to a counselor, having your parents contact the school, or writing a more respectful email explaining the circumstances.

Your teacher also handled this poorly. A good educator should recognize when a student is struggling and work with them rather than immediately giving zeros and involving parents without first trying to understand the situation. The teacher could have been more empathetic and offered alternative solutions.

Your parents seem to have missed opportunities to advocate for you and understand the impact of traumatic content on a young person.

However, the core issue stems from your inappropriate communication style with your teacher, even though your underlying concerns were valid.

The author's friend clearly engaged in harmful behavior by:
- Spreading false information and lies about the author
- Blocking the author from defending themselves
- Continuing to spread information they knew was false
- Using the author's intro without permission after being explicitly told not to
- Creating a compilation video using stolen content without permission or credit

The author's response appears proportionate and legally justified:
- They created the intro and have documented ownership
- They clearly communicated that the friend could no longer use it due to the betrayal
- They're considering using legitimate legal channels (DMCA) to protect their intellectual property
- Their motivation stems from the friend's harmful behavior, not petty revenge

The friends calling the author a ""dick"" seem to misunderstand the situation - this isn't about being vindictive, but about protecting one's work from someone who has proven untrustworthy and harmful.

The author expressed interest in sex, had a nice day with their partner, but the partner was tired and wanted to cuddle instead. The author then took care of their own needs privately through masturbation, which is a normal and healthy response. When asked directly the next morning, they were honest about what they did. The partner is now upset and giving them the silent treatment, calling masturbation ""disgusting.""

The core issues here are:
1. The partner's reaction to normal sexual self-care
2. The partner's apparent expectation that the author should suppress their sexual needs when the partner isn't available
3. The silent treatment as a response to honesty

While the author could have potentially been more tactful in how they shared this information, they were responding honestly to a direct question. More importantly, masturbation is a normal part of human sexuality and personal autonomy. The partner's reaction - calling it disgusting and ignoring the author - is disproportionate and controlling.

The partner is creating an unreasonable standard where the author should deny their own sexual needs and is punishing them for normal behavior.

- Made threats against the author's underage girlfriend
- Repeatedly engaged in destructive, drunken behavior
- Has a pattern of physical attacks when angry

The father has:
- Enabled this dangerous behavior by refusing to remove the brother when warned
- Continued to invite the brother back despite the violence and threats
- Prioritized his relationship with the older son over the safety of his minor child

- Is asking whether he's wrong for not forgiving his brother
- Has not engaged in any wrongdoing described in the situation

- Appropriately called police and removed himself from danger

The author is dealing with legitimate trauma from physical assault and ongoing threats, while being pressured to ""forgive and forget"" by family members who continue to enable the dangerous behavior. The author has every right to maintain boundaries with someone who has physically attacked him and threatened his girlfriend.

The fault lies clearly with the brother (for violence and threats) and the father (for enabling), not with the teenage victim who is struggling with how to handle ongoing exposure to his attacker.

While his hygiene and social behaviors may be genuinely problematic, your response involves public humiliation and deliberate exclusion. The fact that you have a code name for him and acknowledge ""we actually has a code for him"" suggests this is systematic rather than isolated reactions.

Your defense of your friend was understandable, but the overall pattern shows multiple people engaging in harmful behaviors - the arrogant classmate being cruel, and you engaging in what does appear to be bullying behavior toward another student, regardless of his issues.

The neighbor's behavior was clearly inappropriate - accusing someone of deliberately giving ""ugly"" bagels when they were receiving free food as a generous gesture is ungrateful and rude. However, the author's response of immediately kicking out the entire family, including innocent children who were visibly uncomfortable, was quite harsh.

The author then decided to stop texting about the bagels entirely, which effectively cuts off the children's access to something they enjoyed, using them as collateral in the dispute with their mother. While understandable given the frustration, this punishes the kids for their mother's behavior.

The neighbor escalated unnecessarily over free food, but the author's reaction was disproportionate and now negatively impacts children who did nothing wrong. The author even acknowledges feeling sad that the kids didn't come by, showing awareness that their approach may have been too extreme.

Both parties handled this poorly - the neighbor was ungrateful and accusatory, while the author was overly harsh and is now punishing innocent children. Neither person took the high road or tried to resolve this in a way that preserved the positive relationship with the kids.

The sister (mother) is significantly more at fault - she initiated the idea, participated in restraining her own daughter, refuses to allow an apology, dismisses her daughter's feelings as being a ""drama queen,"" and fails to recognize the serious boundary violation that occurred.

The 13-year-old niece clearly said no and has every right to be upset about being physically restrained and having something done to her body against her will.

The friend described exhibits clearly problematic behavior - making cruel comments about someone being ""poor,"" calling them an ""albino monkey,"" and generally bullying someone the group already picks on. This crosses well beyond normal teasing into genuine cruelty. Additionally, his inability to handle any criticism while dishing out harsh treatment to others shows a significant character flaw.

However, the author and their friend group are also participating in targeting someone they describe as ""this kid that no one really likes"" who they ""all kind of pick a little fun at."" This is group bullying behavior, regardless of whether one person takes it further than others.

The author seems to recognize that their friend's behavior is wrong and ultimately chose to end the friendship when the friend couldn't take responsibility. This shows some moral awareness. However, they were complicit in the bullying dynamic for months before reaching this breaking point.

The friend's refusal to apologize to the author while apologizing to others who ""didn't stand up for themselves"" suggests he only respects those who challenge him, which is manipulative behavior.

The author is sharing content that contains insensitive and inappropriate views about pregnant women and disability accommodations. While they note it's from someone else (Joe Festa), they chose to amplify these views by posting them, which suggests some level of agreement or at least willingness to spread this content.

The arguments themselves show a lack of understanding about pregnancy-related physical challenges and the purpose of such accommodations. Expecting mother parking exists for legitimate health and safety reasons, similar to disability parking.

The author describes 5 years of constant accusations and jealousy from his girlfriend - being questioned for simply looking around, having normal social media notifications misinterpreted as talking to other women, and never gaining her trust despite meeting family and maintaining what he describes as faithful behavior. This pattern of persistent, unfounded jealousy and accusations is emotionally exhausting and damaging to a relationship.

The breaking point came when the author simply asked to see a photo after glimpsing what appeared to be her with another man - a reasonable request given the context of her constant suspicions about him. Her extreme reaction to this request, combined with her later blaming him to friends, suggests she was projecting her own issues onto him.

While the author could potentially have communicated better about the trust issues earlier in the relationship, the core problem appears to be the girlfriend's inability to trust despite no evidence of wrongdoing, combined with possible hypocrisy given her defensive reaction about the photo.

The author's decision to end the relationship after 5 years of this pattern seems reasonable and necessary for his wellbeing.

The author is dealing with legitimate frustration - it's genuinely disappointing when game categories don't align with your knowledge areas. However, their response was problematic in several ways:

1. **Demanding special treatment**: Asking someone to ""let you have"" answers in a trivia game undermines the entire point of the game
2. **Poor sportsmanship**: Huffing, sighing, playing on phone, and eventually throwing the controller shows immature behavior
3. **Emotional manipulation**: Making the mom feel so guilty that she intentionally lost all her points

The mother was simply playing the game as intended - answering questions she knew. She had no obligation to give away answers, especially since that would make the game meaningless. Her decision to throw away her points at the end shows she was trying to be considerate, but she shouldn't have felt pressured to do so.

While it's understandable to feel frustrated when losing, the author's expectation that others should play poorly to make them feel better, combined with their tantrum-like behavior, makes them primarily at fault here.

The friend's behavior shows some concerning elements - asking for a large sum ($3000) with no explanation, setting a tight deadline (""by end of the day""), and being evasive about the purpose while claiming it's a ""time of need."" However, asking friends for help during genuine emergencies, even distant ones, isn't inherently wrong. People sometimes can't or don't want to share private details about their financial difficulties.

The author appears to have handled this reasonably. They seem to have declined the request (though this isn't explicitly stated) and sought perspective from their spouse. There's no indication they were rude or inappropriate in their response.

The wife's reaction seems proportionate - she found the approach questionable given the distant relationship and lack of transparency, which is a reasonable perspective.

While the friend's approach was less than ideal (being secretive and demanding), financial emergencies can make people act in ways that seem pushy or inappropriate. Without knowing if there was a genuine crisis or what the money was actually for, it's difficult to definitively say the friend was ""at fault"" rather than just handling a difficult situation poorly.

Priority seats exist specifically for people with mobility issues, disabilities, elderly passengers, pregnant women, etc. When you sit in one of these seats, there's an implicit social contract that you'll be aware of your surroundings and ready to offer the seat when needed. By having your music so loud that you couldn't hear anything and being completely ""spaced out,"" you weren't fulfilling that responsibility.

The lady with the walking stick had to stand longer than necessary because of your inattentiveness. While you immediately apologized and gave up the seat once you realized the situation, the harm was already done. The fact that it was unintentional doesn't eliminate your responsibility - it just means you made a mistake rather than acted maliciously.

The subway performer, while perhaps not talented, was likely trying to earn money through busking - a legal activity in most places. Even if her singing was genuinely poor, she wasn't doing anything wrong by performing in a public space.

The author's approach was unnecessarily cruel and humiliating. While everyone has experienced annoyance with street performers, there were much better ways to handle this:
- Simply moving to a different part of the platform
- Wearing headphones
- Taking a different train
- If absolutely necessary, politely asking if she could take a break

Instead, the author chose to publicly embarrass someone by essentially paying them to acknowledge they're bad at what they're doing. The phrasing ""If I give you a dollar, will you stop singing?"" was designed to be hurtful rather than constructive. Even when she mentioned having classical training, the author doubled down with another cutting remark.

The wife's mortification and the friend's comment about being ""the world's biggest asshole"" suggest that others recognized this behavior as inappropriate. The author's admission of not caring as long as the singing stopped shows a lack of empathy for how their actions affected another person.

The author made a practical decision with his girlfriend to celebrate Valentine's Day on February 18th due to legitimate scheduling conflicts - her demanding work schedule at a flower shop during Valentine's season and his major exams plus graveyard shift. This was a mutual decision that made sense for both of them.

However, the author then made the mistake of sharing with a mutual friend that he was looking forward to saving money due to post-Valentine's Day price drops. While this might be a natural thought (and even a practical benefit), sharing this sentiment with others was tactless and gave the impression that saving money was a primary motivation rather than just a side benefit of their necessary scheduling compromise.

The mutual friend acted inappropriately by repeating this information to the girlfriend, especially in a way that distorted the author's intent. The friend presented it as the author ""purposely prolonging valentine's day so I won't have to spend money on her,"" which mischaracterizes the situation and creates unnecessary relationship drama.

The girlfriend's reaction seems understandable given how the information was presented to her, though we don't have details about her specific response.

They've expressed concern about K's involvement with drugs (including serious substances like crack), risky sexual behavior, and academic failure. Despite these ongoing efforts, K's situation has only worsened.

The author is facing a genuine dilemma: they want to help but recognize that their current approach isn't working. The idea of stepping back isn't coming from a place of abandonment, but from hoping that natural consequences might motivate K to change when other interventions haven't.

At 14-15 years old, the author has already gone above and beyond what could reasonably be expected. They cannot force K to make better choices, and continuing to enable the situation by always being there regardless of K's behavior may actually be counterproductive.

While stepping back from a friend in crisis feels harsh, sometimes it's the most loving thing to do when all other approaches have failed.

- A pattern that repeated across relationships
- Attempting to contact exes who have blocked him

- Continuing to attempt contact with victims who have clearly established boundaries
- Self-focus on his own healing rather than the harm caused

Your friend is posting frequently about a major part of her life (law school) on her own social media accounts, which is pretty normal behavior. Many people share extensively about significant life events, careers, or achievements. While the frequency might be annoying to you, she's not doing anything inherently wrong by posting about her experiences.

However, her repeated discouraging comments about your law school plans (""are you sure you want to do it? It's so hard. Please don't do it"") are problematic. A supportive friend should encourage your goals, not repeatedly try to dissuade you, especially when you've been supportive of hers.

On your side, you're experiencing what seems like jealousy and resentment. You mention being ""triggered"" by her posts and feeling like you're ""faking excitement"" - these are internal emotional responses that you're responsible for managing. You also make some concerning comments about university rankings that suggest you may be looking down on her achievements.

The core issue appears to be that you're taking her social media posts personally and allowing them to affect your friendship, while she's being unsupportive of your goals in direct conversations.

This seems like a case where both parties are contributing to the problem - she's being discouraging about your plans, and you're harboring resentment over normal social media behavior.

The parents are at fault for several key reasons:
- They actively refused to learn basic skills, explicitly stating ""Why? We have you to do it"" when encouraged to become independent
- They used guilt manipulation (""we provide everything for you"") to coerce continued help rather than addressing the underlying issue
- They created learned helplessness by consistently avoiding taking responsibility for basic technology tasks
- They dismissed the author's reasonable requests for them to develop independence

While the author could have been more assertive in maintaining boundaries after initially trying to stop, this is understandable given the family pressure and guilt-tripping involved. The author did attempt to set appropriate boundaries and encourage independence, which was the right approach.

The parents' argument about family helping each other would be valid if this were occasional assistance with genuinely difficult tasks. However, repeatedly needing help with the same basic functions (like pressing a router reset button) after years of use indicates willful dependence rather than legitimate need for support.

The author's frustration is completely justified, and their instinct to encourage independence was correct both for their own well-being and their parents' development of necessary life skills.

While ADHD can certainly cause challenges with time management, forgetfulness, and organization, it doesn't excuse:
- Repeatedly breaking your belongings and refusing to take responsibility
- Consistently being hours late without communication despite your clear requests
- Throwing tantrums and damaging property
- Dismissing your financial constraints when making housing decisions
- Using her diagnosis as a blanket excuse while showing she can remember and respect boundaries when it matters to her (like getting upset with other friends for being late)

The key issue here is that she showed selective application of consideration - she could remember to get angry at others for lateness, but couldn't remember your repeated requests for basic courtesy. She also showed she could prioritize her own needs (choosing the expensive housing option) while completely disregarding yours.

Your attempts to communicate your needs were reasonable and patient. You gave her numerous chances over a decade, and she consistently chose not to change her behavior or take responsibility.

Let me analyze the dynamics:

The parents are creating a contradictory situation - they complain about the teenager not helping enough while simultaneously preventing opportunities for the teenager to learn and contribute. By redoing tasks and telling the teenager to ""try another day,"" they're reinforcing their child's inexperience rather than allowing the natural learning process to occur.

However, the teenager could be more proactive in addressing this pattern through direct communication about wanting to learn, even if initial attempts aren't perfect.

The core issue stems from the parents' approach - they seem to prioritize having tasks done ""correctly"" over allowing their child to develop independence and life skills. This is counterproductive to their stated goal of wanting more help around the house.

The author witnessed clear academic dishonesty - a student using their phone during a test, which is typically prohibited and constitutes cheating. The author had studied hard for the test, making the cheating particularly unfair to honest students. Academic integrity policies exist to ensure fair assessment for all students.

While some might argue that ""snitching"" is socially undesirable, in an academic context, reporting cheating serves important purposes:
- It protects the integrity of the testing process
- It ensures fair treatment for students who follow the rules
- It upholds academic standards that benefit everyone

The author didn't act out of malice or personal vendetta, but rather out of a sense of fairness after witnessing repeated cheating behavior. The cheating student made the choice to violate academic policies, and the natural consequence of that choice is potential punishment when caught.

The professor's decision to fail the cheating student was based on the student's own actions, not solely on the author's report.

The neighbors, while well-intentioned, are being pushy and guilt-tripping the author for not socializing. Complaining that the author is ""neglecting them"" and scolding them for not saying hello immediately upon arrival shows a lack of understanding and respect for boundaries. The mother is also being controlling by monitoring through cameras and pressuring the author into social situations they clearly don't want.

The author has every right to decline social invitations, especially when dealing with personal struggles. Wanting solitude during a difficult time is completely normal and healthy. The lie about going to a restaurant party was told to avoid further confrontation, which is understandable given the pressure they're facing.

The neighbors and mother are failing to respect the author's autonomy and emotional needs. Being ""nice"" doesn't give someone the right to ignore another person's boundaries or make them feel guilty for self-care choices.

The author acknowledges overstepping by asking the same person out three times despite repeated rejections. The third rejection involved the girl getting ""really really mad,"" which indicates she felt harassed or uncomfortable with the persistent unwanted attention. The author recognized this was wrong behavior and appropriately cut contact.

However, now the author wants to re-initiate contact after 6 months, claiming it's just to ""see how she's doing."" Given the context - that this person was upset enough to get ""really really mad"" at the persistent romantic advances - any contact from the author would likely be unwelcome and could reasonably be seen as continued harassment, regardless of stated intentions.

The girl has made her boundaries very clear through her reactions. Respecting those boundaries means staying away completely, not finding new reasons to make contact.

- Accurately described the item and allowed full testing
- Was upfront about lacking knowledge regarding the buyer's specific use case

- Correctly stated UK consumer law regarding private sales

Under UK law, private sellers are only required to accept returns if items are not as described or defective.

Your comment ""jumping back on that dick again, eh"" was problematic for several reasons:

1. It reduced Sam's new partner to their genitalia, which is particularly harmful when discussing relationships involving trans/non-binary individuals
2. It implied that Sam's attraction was primarily about anatomy rather than the person
3. Even if unintended, it reinforced harmful stereotypes about how people relate to trans partners
4. The casual, crude tone was inappropriate when discussing someone's new relationship

However, I also note that:
- You acknowledged it was tone deaf and apologized
- Your intent wasn't malicious
- You were trying to continue a casual conversation pattern you'd established
- Sam's reaction, while understandable, was quite strong given your history and immediate apology

The core issue is that regardless of your intent, your comment was genuinely hurtful and reflected insensitive thinking about gender and relationships. Sam had every right to be offended. While your apology showed some accountability, the damage to trust around a sensitive topic was significant.

The author made some questionable choices - blocking someone during a conversation rather than communicating clearly, and perhaps not being direct enough about boundaries earlier in the relationship. However, these seem to stem from hurt feelings and anxiety rather than malicious intent.

The friend's behavior is more concerning: being emotionally unavailable while leading the author on, taking weeks to respond to serious matters (like the author's sick mother), being consistently flaky, and most significantly - showing up at the author's university after being explicitly told ""no"" and asked to respect their decision. This last action is particularly problematic as it disregards clear boundaries and consent.

The friend appears to have used the author as an emotional placeholder while dealing with his ex-relationship issues, then violated their clearly stated boundaries when the author tried to protect themselves.

The author's core concern is legitimate - wanting their parents' attention during a university open day that's crucial for their future is completely reasonable. The pattern they describe (sister screaming when not the center of attention, parents being too tired to engage) suggests this is an ongoing issue that has built up over time.

However, the author did escalate to yelling when their mother mentioned activities for kids at university open days. While the frustration is understandable given the context, yelling wasn't the most constructive way to handle the situation. The mother was likely trying to find a compromise that would work for the whole family.

That said, the mother's response of getting ""a bit mad"" at a reasonable request and then focusing on entertainment for the 5-year-old rather than acknowledging her older child's needs shows some insensitivity to the situation.

The author is a 21-year-old who has been away for military service for 3 years and has intentionally distanced himself from what he describes as a toxic family environment. He's now facing pressure about whether he should intervene with his younger siblings' school attendance issues.

Key factors:
- The author is not the parent and has no legal responsibility for these minors
- The parents (particularly the father) are actively undermining discipline and creating dysfunction
- The author has been absent for legitimate reasons (military service) during crucial developmental years
- The siblings are old enough (14-15) to understand consequences but are in a dysfunctional environment

- The author recognizes he cannot force change when parents won't support it

While it's natural to want family members to step up, the author is not obligated to parent his siblings, especially when the actual parents are actively sabotaging any efforts.

- They haven't actually done anything yet - they're just considering it

The SO's reluctance to share the price might have various reasons (embarrassment about spending little/much, wanting to keep focus on sentiment rather than cost, etc.), but repeatedly deflecting the question when directly asked creates the curiosity gap.

While some might argue it's better to let sleeping dogs lie, the author's transparency about their intentions and their direct communication approach suggests they're handling this reasonably.

We intended to re-establish our ...",Other,Author,0.75,0.625,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the relationship dynamics and boundaries involved.

The author is on a break with their partner - they're not currently together, even if they hope to reconcile eventually. During this break, the friend developed feelings for the ex-partner and pursued them (though apparently unsuccessfully). The author feels betrayed, especially given the friend's previous representation of being gay and his close involvement in their relationship situation.

While I understand the author's hurt feelings, the key issue is that they are currently on a break. The ex-partner is technically free to make her own choices, and she appears to have rejected the friend's advances anyway. The friend's behavior, while perhaps tactless given the circumstances and his close relationship to both parties, isn't necessarily a betrayal of someone who is currently single.

The author's hostility and assumption that others are ""just as much if not more"" at fault suggests they may be struggling to accept the reality of their current relationship status and the autonomy of the other parties involved.

The situation involves hurt feelings and poor timing rather than clear wrongdoing, but the author's reaction seems disproportionate to the actual circumstances.

He of...",Author,Author,0.75,0.9103448275862069,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the key facts: the 4-year-old daughter has expressed interest in learning an instrument after being introduced to various options, the husband wants to start her early (which is pedagogically sound for music), and the mother is concerned about forcing music on the child.

The critical point here is that the daughter has already shown interest and made a choice after being given options. The husband isn't forcing a specific instrument on her - he introduced her to many and let her pick. Starting music education early (ages 3-6) is actually considered optimal by music educators, as children's brains are most receptive to musical learning during this period.

The mother's concerns about forcing music are understandable, but they seem to be based on hypothetical scenarios rather than the current reality where the child is expressing genuine interest. The husband appears to be following good practices: early exposure, letting the child choose, and recognizing the developmental benefits.

However, both parents need to be on the same page about their child's activities, and the mother's concerns about potential pressure deserve consideration. The ideal approach would be to start lessons with clear agreements about keeping it fun and stopping if the child loses interest.

The mother seems to be the primary obstacle to something the child wants to try, based on fears of what might happen rather than what is happening.

The author received a notification about an account name change that wasn't theirs, discovered someone else was using their name, and initially tried to resolve it diplomatically by messaging the other person. However, when the other person responded rudely, the author escalated by:
1. Changing the other person's password
2. Deleting their recovery phone number  
3. Modifying their bio

While the other person was rude in their response, the author's actions constitute unauthorized access to someone else's account, which is essentially hacking. Even if done with the stated intention of being a ""learning opportunity,"" these actions are:
- Illegal in most jurisdictions
- Unethical regardless of the other person's behavior
- Disproportionate to the offense (rudeness)
- Potentially harmful (locking someone out of their account)

The fact that the other person may be a minor and was rude doesn't justify taking control of their account. There were other appropriate ways to handle this, such as reporting the issue to the platform administrators.

The author's actions cross a clear legal and ethical line, making them primarily at fault despite the provocation.

The author made a genuine effort to contact their husband - 4 phone calls over a 20-minute commute is quite reasonable. They were trying to include him in the dinner decision but couldn't reach him. At that point, they had to make a practical decision about getting food.

While it might have been considerate to get something for the husband anyway, the author isn't obligated to guess what he might want, especially when he was unreachable. The husband's lack of response (assuming he was available to answer) contributed to this situation. However, this seems like a minor miscommunication rather than anyone being seriously at fault.

This appears to be a normal relationship dynamic where better communication could have prevented the issue, but no one acted unreasonably given the circumstances.

Your grand aunt has been persistently trying to force you back to church despite your clear disinterest, which is disrespectful of your autonomy and religious choices. Her timing was also poor - approaching you when you were clearly exhausted from camp shows a lack of consideration.

However, your response escalated the situation dramatically. While frustration is understandable, shouting at her to ""get lost"" and calling her ""crazy and delusional"" crosses into hurtful personal attacks. These words likely caused significant emotional harm, especially to an elderly family member who, despite her pushy approach, probably believes she's acting out of love and concern for your spiritual well-being.

Both parties contributed to this conflict - she through persistent boundary-crossing, and you through an explosive, hurtful response. However, the verbal attack with cruel language represents a more severe transgression than her annoying but well-intentioned persistence.

The author demonstrates several problematic attitudes and actions:

1. **Medical misinformation**: The author incorrectly believes that having had the flu once this year makes them immune to spreading it. Flu immunity is strain-specific, and there are multiple flu strains circulating. You can catch and spread different strains.

2. **Disregard for vulnerable populations**: Even if the author were immune (which they likely aren't), they're in a hospital setting with immunocompromised patients, elderly individuals, and sick people who are at high risk for severe complications.

3. **Inappropriate behavior toward healthcare staff**: The author admits to being rude to a nurse who was simply doing their job to protect patients and follow hospital safety protocols.

4. **Selfish attitude**: The statement ""I shouldn't have to worry about other people catching it, it's not my concern or my responsibility"" shows a concerning lack of empathy, especially in a healthcare setting.

5. **Misunderstanding of hospital policies**: While hospitals may not have legal authority to force mask-wearing, they absolutely have the right to set safety protocols for visitors, and visitors can be asked to leave if they don't comply.

The nurse was appropriately trying to protect vulnerable patients and following standard hospital infection control procedures. The author's response was both medically uninformed and socially irresponsible.

The girlfriend made some concerning choices - pushing the author to change his style to match someone else, wanting to do cocaine with a sketchy person who was already distributing drugs without clear consent, and calling him a ""square"" during their argument. Her recent pattern of reckless drinking and drug use, especially while on medication, is legitimately concerning.

However, the author also escalated the conflict by telling her to ""fuck off"" and storming out, rather than trying to have a calmer conversation about his very valid concerns regarding her safety and their relationship.

The German anarchist's behavior of giving people drugs without clear informed consent was problematic and dangerous.

This appears to be a situation where a couple with normally good communication skills hit a perfect storm of alcohol, peer pressure, medication interactions, and stress that brought out poor behavior from multiple parties. The girlfriend's recent concerning patterns and the author's legitimate safety concerns suggest deeper issues that need addressing, but the immediate conflict involved poor choices and communication from both partners.

Initially, the author offered to split the referral bonus 50/50, but the acquaintance explicitly refused, saying he didn't want any bonus and just wanted to get accepted. The author then offered to help with interview preparation instead, and they agreed to ""get wasted one night"" as settlement for this help.

However, at the Christmas party, the acquaintance brought up splitting the referral bonus again, asking ""we can split it right?"" This created confusion about what was actually agreed upon. The author gave a non-committal response (""let's see as soon as the money comes"") rather than clearly restating their original agreement.

The core issue is that there were conflicting understandings of the final agreement. The acquaintance initially refused the bonus split but later seemed to expect it. The author's ambiguous response at the Christmas party could reasonably be interpreted as reopening the possibility of sharing.

While the author has a valid point about the original refusal, their unclear communication at the party contributed to the misunderstanding. The acquaintance also bears responsibility for changing his position after initially refusing the bonus and not being clear about this change.

Both parties failed to communicate clearly and confirm their mutual understanding, leading to this conflict.

The ex-girlfriend is clearly engaging in deceptive behavior - lying to both parties about her relationships with each of them, maintaining emotional connections with her ex while in a rebound relationship, and creating a web of dishonesty. This is manipulative and unfair to both men.

However, the author's proposed action of telling Jack ""the truth"" is problematic. While framed as helping Jack make an informed decision, this intervention:
- Could be motivated by residual feelings or a desire to disrupt the relationship
- Involves inserting himself into a situation he's already decided to remove himself from
- May cause more drama and pain for everyone involved
- Could be seen as vindictive despite good intentions

The author has already made the healthy decision to cut contact. Getting involved further by revealing information to Jack contradicts this boundary and could perpetuate the toxic dynamic.

Jack, while being deceived, isn't actively doing anything wrong in this scenario.

The most ethical path would be for the author to maintain his decision to cut contact and allow the relationship between his ex and Jack to unfold naturally, rather than intervening based on speculation about future harm.

He absolutely loves to assert himself...",Other,Nobody,0.85,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I can see the author is dealing with genuinely frustrating and distracting behavior from their brother during driving. The brother's backseat driving comments like ""You didn't have to let that car go ahead of us"" and ""You don't have to change lanes yet, but whatever"" serve no constructive purpose and continue despite being asked to stop.

The author has already tried the reasonable approach of asking their brother to stop, but the brother dismisses their concerns and continues the behavior. The proposed solution - threatening to pull over and following through if necessary - is actually quite measured. It gives the brother a clear choice and consequence, and prioritizes safety by removing distractions while driving.

While the author acknowledges this approach might seem like ""chastising a child,"" sometimes clear boundaries with immediate consequences are necessary when someone won't respect reasonable requests. The brother is creating a safety hazard by distracting the driver, and the author has limited options given family dynamics.

The author is trying to find a solution that allows them to maintain family relationships while protecting their own well-being and driving safety. This seems like a reasonable boundary-setting approach rather than being at fault.

The author is dealing with a relationship that has lost both physical and emotional intimacy, and then immediately after expressing these concerns, their partner asks about entering what's described as a deep emotional commitment with someone else. Their discomfort with the ""relationship"" terminology and timing seems understandable, especially given their current insecurities about their own relationship.

The girlfriend appears to be navigating her own challenges with hormonal changes affecting her sexuality, is actively seeking counseling, and was receptive to working on their relationship issues. Her interest in a queer platonic partnership doesn't seem to come from a place of malice, and she did respect his boundaries when he expressed discomfort.

The friend simply made an offer - there's no indication they were trying to interfere with the relationship.

This seems like a case where people are dealing with legitimate relationship challenges and trying to communicate about boundaries, even if the timing and circumstances created some tension.

You have a diagnosed medical condition (OCD) that creates genuine, involuntary responses to contamination concerns. Your inability to eat food that was burped on isn't a choice or preference - it's a symptom of your condition that you're already treating with medication. You handled the situation maturely by not making a scene, still eating the uncontaminated food, and politely asking your husband to cover his mouth in the future.

Your husband's response, however, was problematic. Getting angry at you for a medical symptom, demanding you eat food you physically cannot consume due to your condition, and threatening that others would tell him to leave you over this shows a concerning lack of understanding and empathy for your mental health condition. While his burping may be unintentional due to his eating habits and acid reflux, his reaction to your OCD response was inappropriate.

His persistent behavior was making you uncomfortable at work and putting you in awkward situations with coworkers staring.

The sister has explicitly told the author what she wants - specific skincare products. While the author believes these products won't work due to the sister's birth control-related acne, gift-giving is fundamentally about showing care and respect for what the recipient values, not about the giver's judgment of what's ""useful.""

The author's intention to get hair products instead, while potentially well-meaning, disregards her sister's clear request. Even if the skincare products don't solve the underlying issue, they might still provide some benefit, comfort, or simply make the sister feel heard and cared for. The sister is an adult who can make her own choices about what she wants to try for her skin.

The author deliberately:
1. Excluded his wife from the lunch using false pretenses because he knew she would disapprove
2. Invited the ex-wife without informing his son, knowing the son would be ""very upset""
3. Made unilateral decisions about maintaining relationships that directly affect his son's family dynamics
4. Put his grandson in a potentially awkward position without the parents' knowledge or consent

While the author may have good intentions about maintaining relationships for the grandson's sake, the deceptive approach and disregard for clearly established boundaries makes this problematic. The son has legitimate reasons to be upset about being deceived and having his wishes disregarded regarding his ex-wife, especially given the circumstances of their divorce (infidelity).

The author's response letter shows some defensiveness and attempts to justify the deception rather than acknowledging the breach of trust. Going behind family members' backs when you know they would object, then trying to rationalize it afterward, demonstrates poor judgment.

The author has clearly and repeatedly communicated their preferences about gifts - they don't want physical items, prefer consumables if anything, and have explained their minimalist aesthetic. They've been especially direct with their girlfriend about not wanting gifts and about their specific vision for their office space.

However, the girlfriend and family members continue to give gifts that directly contradict these stated preferences. The girlfriend, in particular, seems to either not understand or not respect the author's clearly communicated boundaries about their personal space and gift preferences. When the author expressed excitement about finding and choosing their own bonsai, she interpreted this as an invitation to surprise them with any plant, despite years of being told they prefer to choose their own items.

The author's frustration is understandable - they've communicated their boundaries clearly and consistently, yet these boundaries continue to be ignored. While they could potentially be more direct about their displeasure when receiving unwanted gifts, they're trying to be kind and not hurt feelings, which shows consideration for others.

The friend is being extremely cautious about her newborn's health, which is understandable given that newborns have underdeveloped immune systems. However, requiring specific vaccinations from visitors (particularly whooping cough and flu shots) goes beyond typical precautions and enters into what most would consider excessive territory, especially when combined with her plan to ""hide in her house away from people.""

The author is hesitant about getting vaccinations they don't normally get, which is a reasonable personal medical decision. They're not refusing to take any precautions - they're willing to follow standard practices like hand washing and not visiting when sick. They're also being considerate by asking how to handle this sensitively rather than just refusing outright.

While the friend's concerns about her baby's health are valid, her demands are excessive and unreasonable. The author's reluctance to get specific shots for visiting privileges is completely understandable and not unreasonable.

The friend is at fault for making excessive demands that go well beyond normal, reasonable precautions for newborn safety.

However, the standard gym etiquette rule is typically to completely strip all weight from equipment when finished, returning it to how you found it. This ensures:
- Equipment is ready for anyone regardless of strength level
- No assumptions are made about what others can or want to lift
- Consistent, clear expectations for all gym users

The other person was technically correct about proper gym etiquette, though their aggressive approach wasn't ideal. The fact that he was ""pissed"" and there were other available benches suggests he could have handled it more diplomatically.

That said, the author genuinely didn't know they were violating standard etiquette and had good intentions. The other person was enforcing a legitimate rule, even if rudely.

This appears to be a case where both parties had some validity to their positions, but the author was unknowingly breaking standard gym protocol.

The author is 18 and facing a crucial university entrance exam that will determine her educational future and financial situation (needing a scholarship). She's attending expensive preparatory courses that her parents are paying for, and these courses are directly relevant to achieving her academic goals.

The boyfriend is asking her to skip these important courses to spend private time with him, offering his old notes as a substitute. While his desire for more time together is understandable, he's essentially asking her to compromise her educational preparation and waste her parents' money for relationship time.

When she reasonably declines, he responds by questioning her love for him and claiming his sacrifices were pointless because she won't make the same sacrifices for him. This is manipulative behavior - using emotional guilt to pressure someone into making decisions that could harm their future.

The author is being responsible by prioritizing her education and respecting her parents' financial investment. Her refusal to skip courses is entirely reasonable and shows maturity. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he doesn't fully understand or respect the importance of her academic goals.

The author is not at fault for maintaining appropriate boundaries and prioritizing her education over relationship demands that could jeopardize her future.

- Explosive reactions to minor mistakes that created a climate of fear
- Systematically sharing private relationship details with friends, family, AND business partners without your consent

Your actions include:
- Past instances of ""snapping"" at him (though you acknowledge this and show remorse)

While accessing someone's emails without permission is a serious breach of privacy and trust, the context matters significantly here. You had reasonable suspicions based on his established pattern of oversharing with others, you asked him directly about it, and he lied to you. Your suspicions were proven correct - he was indeed sharing intimate details of your relationship and personal struggles with business partners, which has had devastating consequences for your professional relationships and standing in the company.

His pattern of behavior - the emotional manipulation, creating a fear-based environment, systematic oversharing of private information, lying when confronted, and then using your privacy breach to justify removing you from the business - represents a more sustained and damaging course of conduct.

The author made some mistakes (missing check-in, complaining loudly), but these seem relatively minor compared to the airline's poor handling of the situation. The flight attendants making jokes about unreliability in front of stranded passengers who spent the night on airport floors shows poor judgment and insensitivity. While the author could have handled their frustration better, their complaints were largely justified given the circumstances.

The girlfriend is clearly struggling with severe body dysmorphia and eating disorder recovery - these are serious mental health conditions that don't resolve quickly, even with therapy and medication. Recovery from eating disorders and body image issues is typically a long, non-linear process that can take years.

The author expresses legitimate desires for physical intimacy, which is understandable in a relationship. However, his approach is problematic. He's essentially telling someone in recovery from eating disorders that her therapeutic progress isn't fast enough for his sexual satisfaction. His statement that ""it really doesn't seem like she is [trying]"" dismisses her mental health struggles and the reality that she IS getting treatment.

When she explained that pressuring her makes things worse (which is psychologically accurate - pressure often exacerbates body image issues), he dismissed this feedback. The fact that she ""literally never cries in front of me"" but broke down during this conversation suggests this was deeply distressing for her.

The author has legitimate personal preferences - not liking jewelry and finding promise rings conceptually unnecessary. These are valid viewpoints that he's entitled to hold. However, the major issue is how he handled the situation.

When his girlfriend gave him an expensive, meaningful gift, he accepted it and wore it temporarily to ""make her happy,"" which created a false impression of his feelings about it. When directly asked why he wasn't wearing it, he avoided the truth with a dismissive ""Because I don't want to"" response, which understandably upset her. When pressed further, he called her gift ""stupid"" and ""childish"" - language that was unnecessarily harsh and hurtful.

The girlfriend's reaction, while emotional, is understandable given that she spent significant money on what she thought was a meaningful gesture, only to have it dismissed so bluntly. Her accusations about commitment and embarrassment seem to stem from hurt feelings rather than malicious intent.

The core problem is the author's poor communication. He should have either been honest from the beginning about his feelings regarding promise rings, or found a much more tactful way to express his preferences without insulting something that clearly meant a lot to his girlfriend.

While both parties could have handled this better, the author bears primary responsibility for the hurtful way he communicated his feelings.

The author is facing a dilemma about whether to ask for the stepfather's blessing before proposing, given legitimate concerns that the hostile mother might sabotage the surprise proposal. The author has already gotten the biological father's blessing and seems to genuinely care about doing right by his girlfriend, who previously expressed wanting both father figures to be asked.

However, the core issue isn't really about fault - it's about navigating a complex family dynamic. The author isn't doing anything wrong by having concerns about the stepfather potentially telling the mother, who ""despises"" him and might ruin the surprise. The mother and stepfather's hostility toward the author (seemingly based on the long-distance relationship circumstances) creates this difficult situation, but even their disapproval isn't necessarily ""wrong"" - parents can have concerns about their children's relationships.

The girlfriend isn't at fault for wanting family blessings, and the author isn't at fault for having reasonable concerns about maintaining the surprise element of a proposal.

This appears to be a situation where different people have legitimate but conflicting interests and concerns, without anyone actually doing something wrong or harmful.

The author is dedicating 4-6 hours daily (Monday-Thursday) exclusively to gaming, treating their girlfriend as if she's not there despite living together. While they've allocated weekends for her, this creates an imbalance where gaming gets the majority of free time during the week. The comparison to their previous dating situation misses a crucial point: moving in together typically signals a desire for more shared time and connection, not maintaining the same level of separation.

However, the girlfriend's expectations aren't entirely unreasonable either. When couples move in together, it's natural to expect some increase in quality time and attention. The author's complete unavailability during weekdays could feel isolating and dismissive.

That said, the author does show some consideration by dedicating entire weekends to the relationship and communicating their needs clearly. The girlfriend also needs to respect that people need personal time and hobbies for stress relief.

The core issue is that both parties seem to have different expectations about what living together means, and neither is fully considering the other's perspective. The author is being somewhat selfish with their time allocation, while the girlfriend may need to adjust her expectations about constant attention.

This appears to be a case where both people need to compromise and communicate better about their needs and boundaries.

The author appears to have good intentions - they're concerned about their friend's wellbeing and noticed what they perceive as problematic patterns in the friend's relationship. The examples they cite (Evan's comments about cleaning, cooking, and family planning) do sound concerning from an outside perspective.

However, the author crossed a boundary by making an unsolicited judgment (""Yikes"") about their friend's relationship choices. The friend clearly indicated she was happy with her relationship and didn't ask for advice or intervention. When someone shares relationship details, it doesn't automatically invite commentary or attempts to ""help"" them see problems that may not exist from their perspective.

The friend's angry reaction suggests she felt judged and possibly patronized. She explicitly stated she's happy and defended her relationship, which indicates this isn't a case where she's asking for help or showing signs of distress about her situation.

While the author's concerns might be valid, imposing their values and relationship standards on their friend without being asked crosses the line from caring into overstepping. Different people have different relationship dynamics that work for them, and what looks problematic to one person might be perfectly acceptable to the people actually in the relationship.

The author should have either kept their concerns to themselves or found a more gentle, non-judgmental way to check in on their friend's happiness if they were truly worried.

The author has been providing significant help for 3 years caring for their grandfather with Alzheimer's and dementia - this is substantial and commendable. However, on this particular day, they fell asleep when their grandmother needed help, which understandably frustrated her given the demanding nature of caregiving.

The grandmother's reaction was harsh and inappropriate - calling someone names like ""son of a bitch"" and ""lazy piece of shit"" is hurtful, especially toward someone who has been helping consistently. However, she's likely under enormous stress as a primary caregiver for someone with severe dementia, which can lead to emotional outbursts and poor judgment.

The author's frustration is valid - feeling unappreciated after years of help would be painful. But falling asleep during a time when help was needed, while understandable due to sleep deprivation, did leave the grandmother in a difficult position.

Both parties seem to be dealing with stress, fatigue, and challenging circumstances. The grandmother is overwhelmed with caregiving responsibilities, and the author is juggling school, early mornings, and caregiving duties. Neither handled this specific situation perfectly, but both have understandable reasons for their reactions.

This appears to be a case where stress and difficult circumstances led both people to react poorly in the moment.

The author is experiencing genuine distress from a sensory trigger related to their autism - this is not something they can simply ""get over"" or control. High-functioning autism often comes with sensory processing differences that can make certain sounds, textures, or patterns genuinely overwhelming or physically uncomfortable. The author's physical reaction (feeling fidgety and sick) indicates this is a legitimate sensory issue, not just a preference.

However, the friend appears to have developed this speech pattern recently, which could indicate:
- A medical condition
- A speech impediment that developed
- A nervous habit
- Some other underlying cause

The friend is not intentionally causing harm and likely has no idea about the impact on the author.

The author is trying to handle this sensitively by not wanting to be mean or rude, but avoiding the friend entirely isn't a sustainable or fair solution to either party. The author hasn't communicated about this issue yet.

While the sensory sensitivity is real and valid, completely avoiding a friend without explanation isn't the most constructive approach. A gentle, honest conversation about the sensory challenges might be possible while being respectful of the friend's situation.

The author's response included:
- Initially handling the situation appropriately by questioning the fare
- Eventually escalating to profanity and personal insults
- Acknowledging they ""sank to his level"" and expressing regret

While the author did escalate the verbal conflict, this was in response to the driver's attempted fraud, aggressive behavior, and implied threat. The author's initial response was reasonable - questioning an obviously inflated fare. The driver's behavior was the primary catalyst for the entire confrontation, involving both attempted theft and intimidation tactics.

The author's escalation, while not ideal, was a human response to being cheated and threatened. Their acknowledgment of regret shows self-awareness about their part in the verbal exchange.

The core issue stems from the driver's dishonest business practices and aggressive response when confronted.

The author's comment about firing someone for not knowing how to pronounce ""pain au chocolat"" was quite harsh. Many bakery employees, especially younger workers or those new to the job, might not know French pronunciations of menu items. The employee still helped the customer by describing the item as ""bread with chocolate,"" which effectively communicated what the product was. Suggesting someone should lose their job over this seems disproportionate to the situation.

However, the author appears to have a pattern of feeling isolated in family discussions and genuinely seems confused about why their comments are received poorly. They mention this happens ""constantly"" and that they feel like ""the stupid one,"" suggesting some self-awareness that something isn't working in these interactions.

The family's response also matters - while they disagreed with the harsh sentiment, the author feels consistently unsupported and like they can never express opinions without backlash.

The wife also escalated the situation by continuing to do the dishes after being asked to stop, which created additional conflict. However, her initial request and expression of feelings were reasonable, even if the timing wasn't ideal.

Your friend came to you already having feelings for someone else and already considering leaving her current boyfriend. She was seeking validation for a decision she was already leaning toward making. While you said ""yes"" and encouraged her messaging the other person, this appears to have been during a casual conversation where you were tired and likely not fully processing the gravity of the situation.

However, relationship decisions - especially major ones like breaking up - ultimately rest with the people in those relationships. Your friend is an adult who made her own choice about her romantic life. She would have likely pursued this path regardless of your input that night, as she had already developed feelings and was actively considering the change before talking to you.

Your role was more of a sounding board than a decision-maker. Friends often seek support when they're already leaning toward a particular choice, and while advice can influence someone, it rarely creates entirely new desires or feelings.

The author had legitimate reasons for needing rest - working a brutal 3am-11am schedule for months without a day off, being sleep deprived to the point of feeling unwell, and finally taking a much-needed sick day. The desire to sleep in and recover is completely reasonable.

However, the girlfriend was dealing with significant pain from wisdom teeth (which can be excruciating) and was clearly struggling with her morning routine as a result. When someone is in pain and asks their partner for help, especially with basic tasks, that's a reasonable request in a relationship.

The key issue here is communication and empathy on both sides. The author seems to have dismissed his girlfriend's pain and needs (""her 'help' was just her having a bad time and wanting me to solve her problems""), while the girlfriend appears to have been insensitive to his exhaustion and need for rest, arguing that his sick day ""wasn't real.""

Both parties failed to show understanding for their partner's legitimate struggles. The author could have offered some basic help despite being tired, and the girlfriend could have been more considerate of his exhaustion and found alternative solutions or asked more gently.

The author is making a deeply personal decision about placing their child for adoption and has expressed preferences about the adoptive family based on their personal beliefs and concerns about potential bullying. While these preferences may be based on misconceptions about LGBTQ+ families and their children's outcomes, the author has the legal right as the birth parent to specify their preferences in the adoption process.

The family members and friends are expressing their disagreement with what they see as discriminatory preferences, which is also their right to voice their opinions.

However, this is fundamentally about the author's legal right to make decisions about their child's placement. Adoption agencies and lawyers routinely work with birth parents' preferences, even when those preferences may be based on personal beliefs that others disagree with. The author is not preventing anyone from adopting in general - they are making a choice about their specific situation.

While one could argue about whether the author's concerns about bullying are well-founded (research generally shows children of same-sex parents fare just as well), and while others may view the preference as discriminatory, the author is exercising a legal right in a very difficult personal situation.

The girl engaged in emotional cheating, led you on with mixed signals, made promises she couldn't keep, and was dishonest with both you and her boyfriend. Her behavior was manipulative and hurtful.

However, your decision to call her boyfriend crosses a significant line. While I understand you felt used and hurt, this action was primarily motivated by revenge (""I was hurt and felt the need to hurt her"") rather than genuine concern for the boyfriend. You also violated her privacy by offering to share private screenshots of your conversations.

The boyfriend appears to be an innocent party who was being deceived, and while he may have deserved to know the truth, the way you delivered it - out of spite rather than genuine concern - makes your action problematic.

You both made serious mistakes: she through emotional manipulation and cheating, and you through revenge-motivated betrayal of privacy. Neither of you handled this situation appropriately, though her initial deception set the problematic dynamic in motion.

The author is facing a genuine dilemma about family heirlooms that have clear sentimental value to the grandmother and family. The sister-in-law has already demonstrated she doesn't value these particular items (refusing to use them, changing the daughter out of them immediately). The author has legitimate concerns about preserving these items for future generations based on the SIL's past behavior with gifts.

However, the author acknowledges these clothes originally belonged to their brother, and there's a reasonable expectation that they should be offered to the brother's family for their new baby. The author is considering offering them with conditions about returning them if not wanted long-term, which seems like a fair compromise.

The sister-in-law isn't necessarily wrong for having preferences about her children's clothing, but her pattern of rejecting gifts and selling them for ""better"" alternatives does create legitimate concerns about the fate of irreplaceable family heirlooms.

This appears to be a situation where the author is trying to balance family obligations with preserving meaningful items, and their proposed solution (offering with return conditions) seems reasonable and considerate of everyone involved.

The friend (F) was being hypocritical and insulting throughout the game, which created a toxic environment. However, bringing up someone's personal relationship and breakup (""No wonder why [ex's name] left you"") crosses from game-related conflict into deeply personal territory meant to cause emotional harm.

While F's behavior was problematic and hypocritical, using someone's failed relationship as ammunition in an argument is a deliberate attempt to inflict personal pain that goes well beyond the gaming context. This escalated what could have been resolved as a gaming dispute into something much more hurtful and personal.

The fact that the other two players immediately called the author ""a major asshole"" suggests this personal attack was recognized as crossing a significant boundary, even by neutral observers who witnessed F's problematic behavior.

Both parties contributed to the toxic environment, but the author took it to a level that was unnecessarily cruel and personal.

However, the core issue here is about trust, support, and communication in their marriage.

The author has repeatedly promised to be supportive of their wife's career changes and told her they would back her decisions. Now, when she's found something that actually excites her for the first time, the author wants to go back on that promise and discourage her based on assumptions about how she'll react to future challenges.

While the author's concerns about the pattern of job dissatisfaction are understandable, they're making several problematic assumptions: that loving skincare means she'll automatically hate working in that field, that she'll definitely have the same customer service issues, and that this career change will inevitably fail. The author is essentially deciding for their wife that she's incapable of finding job satisfaction, rather than having an honest conversation about their concerns.

The wife has tried different pharmacy environments and is now pursuing something completely different that aligns with her interests. The author's approach of wanting to ""bring up doubts"" to discourage her, while knowing this would likely make her ""give up on it,"" is manipulative rather than supportive.

A better approach would be having an open, honest conversation about both the excitement and the practical concerns, while still honoring the commitment to support her choices.

Your concerns about safety are completely valid.

However, the core issue here isn't really about choosing between you and the dog - it's about your boyfriend's failure to properly address a dangerous animal's behavioral problems. A dog that resource guards aggressively, attacks other dogs, and shows aggression toward humans needs immediate professional intervention, not just ""making it work."" Your boyfriend appears to be in denial about the severity of the situation and his responsibility as the owner.

While your frustration is understandable and your safety concerns are legitimate, framing this as an ultimatum isn't the most constructive approach. The real conversation should be about requiring immediate professional behavioral intervention and acknowledging that this dog may not be suitable for your living situation regardless of training outcomes.

Carl's behavior shows a clear pattern of disengagement from the planning process despite being part of the group and expressing initial enthusiasm. The trip was planned for months with a Facebook group for coordination, yet Carl only minimally participated until the very last minute. Most concerning is that he didn't respond to the ride coordination post last week - a critical logistical element for someone who doesn't drive and lives furthest away.

However, the author's frustration, while understandable, seems somewhat disproportionate. Carl did eventually reach out (albeit late), offered to contribute gas money, and provided legitimate reasons for his limited involvement (moving and injury). The author's partner, who would be equally affected by accommodating Carl, doesn't mind the situation.

The core issue is poor communication and planning on Carl's part, but this appears to stem from legitimate life circumstances rather than deliberate inconsideration. The author's reaction suggests some inflexibility in accommodating a friend's less-than-ideal timing.

The other players were clearly behaving inappropriately by using offensive language (""retarded"") and being generally toxic toward you. This kind of harassment is unacceptable in gaming communities, regardless of how someone is performing in a match. Your initial response of ""these are randoms chill out"" was reasonable - you were trying to de-escalate the situation.

However, leaving the match affects the entire team and can ruin the game experience for everyone, including potentially innocent teammates who weren't participating in the harassment. In most online games, there are better alternatives like muting toxic players, reporting them, or trying to focus on the game despite the negativity.

That said, the primary fault lies with the players who created a hostile environment through their harassment. While leaving wasn't ideal, it's an understandable response to sustained toxicity, especially when your attempt to calm things down was ignored.

The author made several questionable decisions:
1. Agreed to help plan a surprise party with someone who took his number without permission
2. Failed to suggest the girlfriend ask John directly for his friends' contacts
3. Most critically, sent a photo of John to prove his location to the girlfriend

However, the girlfriend's actions were also problematic:
- Taking the author's number without John's knowledge or consent
- Not believing the author when told John was present
- Immediately jumping to breaking up without seeking clarification
- Creating a situation where John felt compelled to lie about his whereabouts

John also contributed by:
- Lying to his girlfriend about his location
- Immediately assuming the worst and accusing the author of cheating
- Not listening to explanations before making accusations

While the author's decision to send the photo was the immediate trigger that exposed John's lie and led to the breakup, this was done in the context of trying to maintain the surprise party plan. The author didn't intend to cause harm and tried to explain when things went wrong.

The real issue is that multiple people made poor communication choices and assumptions. The girlfriend created an unnecessarily secretive situation, John chose to lie, and the author got caught in the middle while trying to help with what seemed like a nice gesture.

This appears to be a case where everyone's poor decisions and communication failures contributed to the outcome.

The author acknowledges that calls are permitted and that the girl isn't being loud, yet still wants to ask her to stop based purely on personal annoyance. This crosses the line from reasonable request into controlling behavior toward a stranger who is following all the rules.

When politely asked to move initially, the intruder refused and argued that since no one was physically sitting there, he should be allowed to stay. This shows a disregard for the ticketing system and the author's property rights. The author escalated appropriately by mentioning security only after the polite request was refused.

The fact that the intruder ""cusses out"" the author before leaving further demonstrates unreasonable behavior on his part. Stadium seating works on a ticket-based system - you sit where your ticket designates, not wherever you find an empty seat.

When relationships end badly, especially with abuse allegations, it's genuinely challenging to navigate without appearing to take sides. Her discomfort discussing the situation, while hurtful to you, may have stemmed from feeling trapped rather than malicious intent.

The fact that she's still trying to maintain a friendly relationship with you at work suggests she may not fully understand how deeply her actions hurt you, rather than being deliberately harmful.

You're experiencing natural emotions about something that feels personal to you - your name and identity. You haven't acted on these feelings in any harmful way, haven't confronted your cousin, and you're even questioning whether your feelings are justified. Having emotions about something that affects you personally doesn't make you an asshole or put you at fault.

Your cousin technically has the right to choose any name for her child, and middle names aren't typically ""owned"" by family members. However, the fact that she's using the exact same spelling of an uncommon name while having a distant relationship with you does make the situation feel somewhat inconsiderate, even if not intentionally malicious.

3. Confronted the person aggressively rather than simply declining the friend request or blocking them

The more appropriate responses would have been to:

- Report to Facebook if there were clear policy violations
- Warn friends privately without directly confronting the person

- Making assumptions about post-wedding behavior without giving people a chance

The author is going through a difficult time and opened up to his girlfriend about his struggles after she expressed feeling neglected. Her response was dismissive and essentially gave him an ultimatum - manage everything perfectly or lose the relationship. This shows a lack of empathy and support when he was vulnerable.

However, the author also admits to being ""very internal"" and that his ""real feelings don't always show,"" which suggests he may not have been communicating his struggles effectively until confronted. The girlfriend did express her needs (feeling neglected) before he explained what was happening.

The core issue seems to be a fundamental mismatch in how they handle relationship challenges and support each other. The author feels he makes sacrifices for her happiness but doesn't receive the same consideration. The girlfriend appears to prioritize her own needs without showing flexibility or understanding during his difficult period.

While both parties have some communication issues, the girlfriend's dismissive response to his vulnerability and her ultimatum-style approach to the relationship problems are more problematic. Breaking up due to incompatibility and feeling unsupported is not being an ""asshole"" - it's recognizing when a relationship isn't working.

3. **Deception**: Lying to parents about going on a ""work trip"" when actually permanently relocating, while understandable given the abusive relationship, still represents deceptive behavior.

4. **Complete communication cutoff**: Blocking everyone and changing numbers is an extreme response that goes beyond what was necessary, even to escape abuse.

Your anger and hurt about being excluded are completely valid emotions - as her closest friend, it's natural to want to support her and feel frustrated about being kept in the dark. Your protective instincts and rage toward the abuser are also understandable human responses.

However, the others likely had legitimate reasons for their approach. When someone experiences severe abuse, the survivor and their support network often make careful decisions about information sharing based on safety concerns and the survivor's needs. Your friends may have been:
- Following your friend's wishes about who to tell and when
- Concerned about your intense reaction potentially escalating the situation dangerously
- Trying to protect both you and her from additional trauma or risk

Your friend, as the survivor, had every right to control how and when her trauma was shared, even if that meant excluding you initially. The others were likely trying to respect her autonomy while managing a delicate situation.

While your feelings are valid, getting angry at people who were trying to handle an extremely difficult situation - and then going home instead of focusing on supporting your friend - wasn't ideal.

The author is describing legitimate workplace issues - unprofessionalism, not working when unsupervised, interrupting conversations, and being on phones instead of working. These are valid concerns that would reasonably frustrate anyone trying to maintain professional standards.

However, some of the complaints seem more subjective - finding their jokes ""bad,"" their music ""bad,"" and their views ""small minded."" The author also seems bothered by normal workplace social interaction (coworkers assuming friendship, being conversational).

The key question is whether the author is at fault for simply *feeling* annoyed by these behaviors. Having internal reactions to genuinely unprofessional conduct isn't wrong - it's natural. The author hasn't described taking any inappropriate actions, just experiencing frustration.

The younger coworkers do bear some responsibility for the genuinely unprofessional behaviors (not working, excessive phone use, interrupting). But for normal social behaviors and subjective preferences, that's just workplace dynamics.

This is a significant relationship milestone that typically benefits from privacy and the opportunity to establish their own routines and dynamics together. Their hesitation is understandable and reasonable.

However, the key issue here is that the fiancé made these plans with her family without consulting the author first. This is a major decision that affects both of their living situations, finances, and relationship dynamics. Making such commitments unilaterally, especially when it involves a three-month arrangement, shows a lack of consideration for the author's input and feelings about their shared living space.

The family's expectation that the author should be ""obligated"" to accept this arrangement further compounds the problem, as it dismisses the author's legitimate right to have a say in who lives in their home.

The friend's expectation that the author should remain on standby after declining the offer, and her extreme reaction to being told ""no,"" shows unreasonable behavior and poor communication skills.

I didn’t mind...",Other,Other,0.8,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I can see frustration on multiple sides, but the core issue seems to be a communication and boundary problem.

The author has legitimate concerns - they've been doing increasing amounts of physical labor without clear boundaries, they don't recall agreeing to this specific job, and they have the right to decline work on their day off. However, the way they're handling it could be more constructive.

The girlfriend appears to be the main source of the problem here. She seems to have either misunderstood a conversation or deliberately misrepresented what was agreed to. More problematically, she told her mother that the author would do the work before getting clear confirmation, which created an awkward situation for everyone. This suggests poor communication skills and possibly some manipulation.

The mother's anger is understandable given that she was told someone would help and then they backed out, but she's directing her frustration at the wrong person.

The girlfriend created this mess by making commitments on someone else's behalf without proper confirmation, and then trying to use social pressure and guilt to make the author follow through. This is the primary fault in the situation.

You were expressing genuine appreciation for an inclusive educational environment and the positive lessons it provides your daughter about diversity and equality. Your intent was clearly positive - celebrating inclusion and the school's balanced approach to supporting students with disabilities while treating them as full participants.

Your friend's response reflects a particular philosophical view about disability awareness - that true equality means not noticing or commenting on differences at all. While this perspective has merit in some contexts, her reaction seems disproportionate to your actual words and intent.

The reality is that noticing and appreciating inclusive practices isn't inherently problematic. Many disability advocates actually encourage recognition of good inclusive practices, as it helps normalize and promote such environments. Your observation that children learn valuable lessons about human diversity in inclusive settings is educationally sound.

Your friend appears to have misinterpreted your positive commentary as somehow othering or tokenizing students with disabilities, when you were actually celebrating their full inclusion and equal treatment.

Neither of you intended harm, but your friend's immediate offense and harsh judgment of your well-meaning comments seems disproportionate and unfair.

The MIL is demonstrating a clear pattern of irresponsible behavior:
- Consistently sleeping in while expecting others to watch her 8-year-old child without asking
- Leaving the house without notice, again assuming childcare would be provided
- Being deliberately rude (not offering food to others at the table)
- Refusing to take responsibility when confronted
- Dismissing legitimate concerns as the author being ""too sensitive""
- Allowing her child to be unsupervised, resulting in property damage

The author appears to have handled this reasonably well - he accommodated the unexpected childcare initially, tried to address issues directly and respectfully, and set appropriate boundaries about expectations in his own home.

While the wife could potentially have been more proactive in addressing her mother's behavior earlier, she did support the author when the boys were being disruptive and seems to recognize the problem (as evidenced by her text about expecting change).

Your girlfriend is dealing with genuine anxiety issues that are significantly impacting her ability to use the gym, while you're feeling frustrated about the lack of progress and constantly interrupted workouts.

Your girlfriend isn't at fault for having anxiety - mental health struggles are real and valid. However, after over half a year of this pattern significantly affecting both of your goals and experiences, there's a reasonable expectation that she would seek some form of help or alternative solutions rather than continuing the same cycle.

You're not at fault for feeling frustrated - it's a natural human response to repeated disappointment and stalled progress. Your feelings are valid, and you've shown considerable patience and accommodation.

However, the core issue here is that this is a mental health problem that requires proper support and potentially professional help, not just continued accommodation of avoidance behaviors. Neither of you seems to be addressing the root cause, which is keeping you both stuck in this cycle.

The author made several significant mistakes:
1. He assumed that friendly service from a waitress (who depends on tips for income) indicated romantic interest
2. When politely rejected, he became hostile and demanding
3. He tried to retroactively take back tips that were already given for service rendered
4. He made a cruel personal attack (""How come you're not dumb anymore?"") when things didn't go his way
5. He framed the waitress's professional friendliness as some kind of deceptive ""act""

The waitress (""Fred"") did nothing wrong. She:
- Provided good service and was friendly to a regular customer
- Politely declined a date request
- Had no obligation to proactively announce her relationship status to customers
- Reasonably expected that tips given for service wouldn't be demanded back

The author's belief that the waitress ""took advantage"" fundamentally misunderstands the service industry dynamic. Waitresses are paid to be friendly and provide good service - this is not romantic interest or deception.

The author's reaction to rejection - becoming hostile, demanding money back, and making personal attacks - shows a concerning sense of entitlement and poor emotional regulation.

The author has legitimate personal reasons for not wanting to attend: they're atheist and uncomfortable with Catholic ceremonies, they're child-free by choice and dislike being around children, they've had conflicts with the hosts over animal treatment, they have nothing in common with Sarah, and they find Mark's behavior off-putting. These are all valid personal boundaries.

However, the author seems to be taking a somewhat rigid stance that could damage their husband's social relationships. While they don't have to attend themselves, dismissing their husband's concern about ""looking bad"" and telling him to stop fulfilling social obligations entirely goes beyond setting personal boundaries into potentially controlling territory.

The husband appears caught between his wife's strong preferences and maintaining friendships, even if those friendships aren't particularly close. His concern about appearances, while perhaps not well-articulated, reflects real social dynamics in maintaining relationships.

The friends (Mark and Sarah) seem to have some problematic behaviors (the dog treatment is concerning, and Mark's bragging is annoying), but inviting friends to their child's baptism is normal social behavior, not inherently wrong.

This seems like a situation where compromise and understanding would serve everyone better than rigid positions.

The author had a legitimate concern about their pre-ordered food not being ready at the specified time, and it's reasonable to want clarification on the restaurant's policies. However, engaging in a 10-minute argument with an employee who was simply following established restaurant policy crosses the line into unreasonable behavior.

The employee was doing their job according to their training and restaurant policy. While the policy itself might be questionable, the employee isn't responsible for setting it and shouldn't bear the brunt of a lengthy complaint session. The fact that another customer felt compelled to intervene with ""Are you serious?"" suggests the discussion had become excessive and uncomfortable for others present.

The author's comparison to restaurant reservations isn't quite apt - takeout orders and dine-in reservations operate under different service models. Many restaurants do prioritize walk-in customers over phone orders to ensure immediate service for people already present.

The author has made significant efforts to help his mother - providing financial support, paying for legal representation, buying her a car, and offering housing. He's asking for a relatively small contribution ($100/month, which he describes as 10% of bills) from someone who is working and living in his home.

However, there are some concerning elements in how this arrangement was set up. The author mentions it was ""under the assumption"" that she would help pay, but it's unclear if this was explicitly agreed upon beforehand. The mother's response ""You said you could afford this place on your own"" suggests there may have been miscommunication about expectations from the start.

The mother appears to be avoiding financial responsibility despite having some income from part-time work, and her responses seem evasive rather than constructive. At the same time, the author may have created this situation by not establishing clear agreements upfront and perhaps enabling dependency.

The core issue seems to be a lack of clear communication and established boundaries from the beginning, combined with the mother's apparent reluctance to take on adult financial responsibilities despite receiving substantial support.

While both parties contributed to this problematic dynamic, the mother's refusal to contribute even a small amount while living rent-free and receiving ongoing support appears to be the primary issue.

The author has a reasonable expectation that they should be informed about charges before incurring them, especially when asking for a refill (which are commonly free at many establishments). Being surprised by an unexpected charge on the bill is a legitimate concern.

However, the waiter also has reasonable grounds - many restaurants don't offer free refills, and it's common practice for customers to ask about pricing if they're unsure. The waiter may have assumed the customer understood the pricing structure.

This appears to be a case of miscommunication and differing assumptions rather than intentional wrongdoing by either party. The author made an assumption about free refills, while the waiter assumed the customer understood the pricing. Neither party acted with malicious intent, but both could have handled the situation better - the author could have asked about pricing, and the waiter could have clarified charges when taking the order.

Since both parties contributed to the misunderstanding through reasonable but ultimately problematic assumptions, this is a shared responsibility situation.

The bride is asking her bridesmaids to lose weight and exercise specifically for photos, which crosses into controlling territory regarding others' bodies and personal choices. While wanting everyone to look their best is understandable, mandating weight loss as a condition of participation in a wedding is problematic. People have different relationships with their bodies, health conditions, time constraints, and personal autonomy that should be respected.

The bridesmaid's refusal to comply with this request is entirely reasonable - she has every right to decline to change her lifestyle or body for someone else's wedding photos. Characterizing her lifestyle as ""very unhealthy"" seems judgmental without knowing her full circumstances.

Removing someone from a wedding party because they won't lose weight on demand is shallow and prioritizes appearance over a 10-year friendship. This could cause lasting damage to their relationship and sends a harmful message about conditional friendship based on physical appearance.

The author acknowledges he knows Southwest's rules - it's open seating, first-come-first-served. By Southwest's official policy, passengers cannot save seats for others who haven't boarded yet. The young woman was technically within her rights to take any available seat.

However, the author also makes valid points about context and courtesy:
- The plane was less than half full with many other available seats
- His family was boarding shortly after him (common practice he mentions doing ""countless times"")
- Seat saving for immediate family members is a widely accepted social norm in many contexts
- He was polite in his initial response

The young woman's behavior, while technically correct according to airline policy, seems unnecessarily confrontational. Her curt ""So?"" response and insistence on those specific seats when many others were available suggests she was being deliberately difficult rather than simply needing a seat.

The author ultimately chose to move rather than escalate, which was probably the mature choice given the circumstances.

The friend is clearly engaging in harmful behaviors - constantly commenting on and comparing food portions, publicly questioning the author's eating habits, and creating an environment where the author feels pressured to overeat. These actions are inappropriate regardless of the friend's mental health struggles.

However, the friend's behavior appears to be driven by her ongoing eating disorder. Her fixation on food comparisons, the need to justify her own eating choices, and the projection of food anxieties onto others are classic manifestations of disordered eating patterns. This doesn't excuse the behavior, but it provides important context that she may not be fully aware of how her actions are affecting others.

The author has legitimate concerns and feelings, and wanting to protect their own relationship with food is completely reasonable. However, they haven't yet attempted to address this directly with their friend in a compassionate way that acknowledges the ED context.

The facts are clear: multiple items in the order were prepared incorrectly or carelessly (burnt fries, unwrapped sandwich just thrown in the bag, incomplete burger). This represents a significant failure in food preparation and quality control that the customer paid for.

The author's response - using the official feedback mechanism (the survey link provided by McDonald's) to give honest feedback about their experience - is exactly what that system is designed for. Companies provide these surveys specifically to gather customer feedback about service quality.

This was a live, intimate acoustic singer/songwriter show in a small venue - a setting where audience attention and respect for the performer is particularly important. The intimate nature of such venues means phone use is more noticeable and disruptive to both the performer and other audience members. Unlike a large concert where individual behavior might go unnoticed, small acoustic shows rely on audience engagement and respectful attention.

The author's comparison to ""reading a book in a bar"" misses the key difference - this was a live performance where someone was actively trying to entertain and connect with the audience. Using a phone during such a performance shows disrespect to the artist and can be distracting to other patrons who paid to enjoy the show.

The fact that multiple people (partner and the couple they were with) found it rude suggests this violated clear social expectations for this type of event. The author did respond appropriately when asked to put the phone away, which shows some awareness, but the initial behavior was inconsiderate.

The author's response, however, was disproportionate and problematic. ""Flipping out"" on someone for having a friendship, then ""yelling repeatedly"" at them the next day shows a pattern of aggressive, controlling behavior. The girlfriend's question about urinals, while oddly timed, doesn't justify the explosive angry response that followed.

The author admits to having insecurities but is handling them by trying to control his girlfriend's social interactions and responding with anger and yelling when those expectations aren't met. This behavior is concerning and inappropriate in a healthy relationship.

While the girlfriend could have been more communicative about her friendships, the author's reaction was far more problematic and represents the primary issue in this situation.

Moving to use the bathroom is a completely reasonable and necessary action. While it's sweet that the author is considerate of their sleeping dog, their own bodily needs take priority in this situation.

The dog won't be harmed by being gently moved or woken up - dogs are quite adaptable and will simply find another comfortable spot to continue sleeping. There's no moral fault in prioritizing basic human needs over a pet's uninterrupted nap.

The other person's response was completely disproportionate and inappropriate. Even if the foot was somewhat in the way, stomping on an injured person's foot and verbally abusing a minor is never acceptable. A reasonable person would have tried to get the author's attention more clearly, asked other passengers for help, or simply stepped around if there was indeed 3 feet of clearance as described.

By offering initial support (""call me if you need to"") but then refusing help when the person was in crisis, hanging up, and subsequently ghosting them, the author failed to follow through on their commitment during a potentially life-threatening situation. While no one is obligated to be someone's sole support system, once you've positioned yourself as someone who can be called in crisis, abruptly withdrawing that support when it's most needed can be harmful and potentially dangerous.

The appropriate response would have been to either provide support, help connect the person with professional resources (crisis hotlines, emergency services), or at minimum explain the inability to help while ensuring they had other resources - not to hang up and ghost them entirely.

However, you also made a significant mistake by cheating rather than properly ending the relationship first. While the relationship was clearly toxic and likely doomed after the assault, cheating was still a betrayal of trust and the wrong way to handle the situation.

The author is developing feelings for someone she's been dating and feels uncomfortable with his close relationship with his ex. She's considering ending things rather than trying to control his friendships or create ultimatums. This is actually a mature approach - recognizing incompatibility and considering walking away rather than demanding he change.

The guy she's dating appears to be honest about his situation and maintaining friendships with exes, which isn't inherently wrong. Some people can successfully maintain platonic friendships with former partners.

The ex/exfwb being upset about the new relationship is understandable human emotion, though we don't know if she's acting inappropriately.

The core issue here seems to be a compatibility mismatch rather than anyone doing something morally wrong. The author has every right to decide she's not comfortable with this dynamic and choose to end things. That's not being an asshole - that's knowing your boundaries and acting on them rather than trying to force someone to change.

The author's desire to know about their ex's sexuality during their relationship is understandable from a human curiosity standpoint - discovering that a long-term partner had kept something significant hidden can naturally raise questions. However, several factors make the author's approach problematic:

1. **Boundary violation**: After months of no contact, reaching out to demand personal information about someone's sexual identity crosses appropriate boundaries, especially when the ex explicitly stated it wasn't the author's business.

2. **Persistence despite hostility**: The author admits to ""pushing hard"" even when the ex was clearly uncomfortable and hostile about the questioning.

3. **Self-acknowledged past behavior**: The author admits they both ""made each other feel bad about who we were"" in the early relationship, which provides context for why the ex might have felt unsafe sharing this information.

4. **Timing and motivation**: This inquiry came after they had already broken up and stopped talking - the information serves no constructive purpose and appears driven more by personal validation needs than genuine concern.

The ex-girlfriend's hostility, while understandable given the circumstances, could have been handled more diplomatically, but her core position that this information wasn't the author's business was correct.

The author is primarily at fault for overstepping boundaries and prioritizing their own emotional needs over their ex's privacy and comfort.

The author did inform Sam beforehand that he might be called (though with only 1% likelihood), and when a genuine emergency arose, they needed legal expertise. However, the author's approach was problematic in several ways:

1. Threatening to fire someone on their wedding day (""I'd let him go if he didn't get on the fucking phone"") shows poor judgment and unnecessary aggression
2. While Sam was technically on-call, interrupting someone's wedding should be an absolute last resort
3. The author seems to lack empathy for the significance of the timing

Sam's initial refusal and anger were completely understandable given the circumstances - it was his wedding day. However, he was technically on-call and did ultimately fulfill his professional obligation when pressed.

The author created this situation by not having better contingency planning for such an important merger during a key team member's wedding. While the emergency was genuine, the handling was unprofessional.

Both parties bear some responsibility - the author for poor management and threatening behavior, and Sam for initially refusing when he had agreed to be on-call. However, the author's conduct was more problematic given their position of power and the aggressive approach.

Your sister also handled this poorly by walking away instead of communicating more constructively, but her frustration seems understandable given the skill gap and feeling unheard.

The author is being honest about their limitations and actively trying to avoid situations where they might harm their brother. They recognize they're not equipped to handle children, especially one with special needs, and they're trying to set boundaries. However, locking a 7-year-old in his room when overwhelmed is concerning, even if done to prevent worse outcomes.

The parents are struggling with a special needs child in their 50s, which is genuinely difficult. However, they appear to be pressuring someone who has clearly stated they're not capable of providing appropriate care. Asking someone who admits to having violent impulses toward children to babysit is poor judgment that puts the child at risk.

The author's self-awareness about their limitations is actually responsible - they're trying to protect the child by maintaining distance. While their feelings toward their brother are unfortunate, they didn't choose this situation and are attempting to manage it without causing harm.

The acquaintance is sending unwanted messages multiple times daily despite receiving no responses or acknowledgment. This suggests either a lack of social awareness or disregard for social cues. However, the author has never directly communicated their discomfort - they've only used passive responses like muting and deleting messages.

The author mentions suspecting the person may have ASD, which could explain difficulty reading social cues. This makes direct, clear communication even more important and appropriate.

Key factors:
- The acquaintance's behavior is intrusive and unwanted
- The author has never directly asked them to stop
- There may be a neurodevelopmental factor affecting social understanding
- Both parties bear some responsibility for the miscommunication

The acquaintance should recognize that no responses means disinterest, but the author should also communicate directly rather than expecting someone (especially someone who may have ASD) to interpret passive signals.

The author deliberately told their fiancée a lower amount than the actual bonus, but then shared the real amount with their best friend while the fiancée was present. This created a situation where the fiancée discovered they had been given false information about something that likely affects their shared financial future.

In a committed relationship heading toward marriage, financial transparency is typically expected. The author's choice to minimize the bonus amount to their partner while being honest with their friend suggests a concerning pattern of communication. The fiancée has a legitimate reason to feel hurt and excluded from accurate information about their partner's finances.

While the author may have had reasons for initially downplaying the amount (perhaps not wanting to seem boastful or wanting to manage expectations), the inconsistency in what they told different people, especially when the fiancée could overhear, created unnecessary hurt and mistrust.

She's being practical about timing, recognizing that law school is demanding and wanting to focus on it without the added challenge of pregnancy and a newborn.

The husband has legitimate concerns about fertility (though 29 is not considered high-risk), social dynamics with friends' children, and financial risks. However, his reasoning reveals some problematic attitudes:

1. He dismisses his wife's career ambitions by saying they don't ""need"" her to become an attorney and her current job is ""good enough""

The author is not at fault here. They're a teenager who formed a genuine bond with someone who treated them well during what they describe as the happiest period of their life. Having positive memories and missing someone who was kind to you is a natural human response, especially for a child who may have lacked positive adult figures. The author was honest with their mother about their feelings, which took courage and shows emotional maturity.

The mother's reaction, while understandable given her experience of abuse, was disproportionate and harmful. Calling her child ""just as bad"" for having feelings, taking away their phone, and withholding Christmas presents as punishment for expressing emotions is inappropriate parenting. A more constructive response would have been to acknowledge the child's feelings while explaining the complexity of the situation.

However, this appears to be a situation where the mother is likely still processing trauma from an abusive relationship. Her extreme reaction suggests she may be struggling with her own healing and seeing her child's positive memories as a threat or betrayal of her experience.

The ex-boyfriend's behavior toward the mother was clearly problematic based on the described patterns of emotional abuse, manipulation, and kicking her out after fights.

While the roommate's behavior (leaving food out, creating unsanitary conditions) is clearly problematic and inconsiderate, the author's approach of expecting the roommate to clean the entire apartment alone seems unreasonable.

The author's concerns are well-founded, backed by statistics, and expressed out of genuine care for safety. There is nothing wrong with a passenger - especially a family member - expressing fear about genuinely dangerous driving practices. The father's dismissive ""It's fine"" response to serious safety concerns is problematic and irresponsible.

They initially wrote in $5 and added $5 to the total but then changed ...,Author,Author,0.9,0.8,True,"Looking at this situation, the customer made an honest mistake by not realizing they were double-tipping ($4 cash + $4 on card = $8 total). They clearly intended to tip $4 total, not $8.

The author acknowledges they are ""100% sure"" the customer didn't intend an $8 tip and admits to ""taking advantage of this person's ignorance."" They also reveal a pattern of intentionally taking extra money when customers make similar mistakes, which they justify by claiming customers are ""taking advantage"" of them with small tips.

However, the author's reasoning is flawed:
- A $4 tip on a $22 order (18%) is actually quite reasonable, not exploitative
- The customer made an innocent error, not a deliberate attempt to shortchange the driver
- Taking money the customer clearly didn't intend to give is essentially theft, regardless of the author's tax situation or feelings about tip amounts

The customer bears no fault here - they made an honest mistake while trying to tip appropriately. The author is deliberately taking advantage of this mistake for personal gain.

The author has a legitimate concern about unpleasant odors affecting their comfort in their own bedroom and bathroom space. However, the way this was handled and the underlying expectations seem problematic.

The author is asking their husband to permanently relocate his bathroom usage based on a medical condition (IBS) that he cannot fully control. While the request might seem reasonable on the surface, it essentially treats the husband's medical issue as something shameful that needs to be hidden away from the main living spaces. The husband's reaction, while perhaps not diplomatically expressed, reflects feeling marginalized in his own home.

There were many alternative solutions that could have been explored first - better ventilation, air purifiers, different timing, or addressing the root cause through dietary management. Instead, the author jumped to asking their partner to essentially be exiled to a guest bathroom permanently.

The author's focus on their cosmetics and ""paranoia about poop particles"" suggests this may be more about personal squeamishness than a truly reasonable accommodation request. The characterization of the husband as ""immature and childish"" for wanting to use his own master bathroom also seems unfair.

The author is facing a genuine dilemma about a core value conflict with their best friend. They discovered their friend believes vaccines cause autism, which makes them deeply uncomfortable given their strong opposing views on this topic. The author is questioning whether to end the friendship over this disagreement.

Key considerations:
- People have the right to choose their friendships based on compatibility, including shared values
- The author didn't attack or mistreat their friend - they're privately questioning the relationship
- Core beliefs about health and science can be legitimate dealbreakers for some people
- The friend expressed views that are scientifically unfounded, but she has the right to her opinions
- Neither person appears to have been deliberately hurtful or malicious

This appears to be a case of two people discovering they have fundamentally incompatible worldviews on an important topic. The author is contemplating a difficult personal decision about whether they can maintain a friendship despite this significant disagreement. While it might be sad to lose a friendship over differing beliefs, people aren't obligated to maintain relationships that cause them significant discomfort or conflict with their core values.

Neither person has acted wrongfully here - this is simply an unfortunate discovery of incompatibility.

The author describes dating women in their 20s and 30s (all adults) based on mutual attraction. He acknowledges this sometimes leads to relationship problems but doesn't describe any manipulative, deceptive, or harmful behavior on his part. Adult relationships with significant age gaps aren't inherently unethical when both parties are consenting adults making informed decisions.

The author seems self-aware about the challenges these relationships face and isn't claiming to be entitled to relationships with younger women or pursuing them through inappropriate means. He's simply describing his dating preferences and acknowledging that others disapprove.

While some may find large age gaps concerning or question the power dynamics, without evidence of exploitation, manipulation, or other harmful behavior, this appears to be a matter of personal preference rather than ethical wrongdoing. The relationship issues he mentions (infidelity, incompatibility, etc.) are problems that can occur in any relationship regardless of age differences.

The sister provided significant, life-saving support during a vulnerable time - offering housing when the author had nowhere else to go, helping with medical appointments, and making real sacrifices (cramming her 4 children into one room). This wasn't just casual help; it was substantial support that may have prevented the loss of the pregnancy.

However, the author's response shows a concerning lack of appreciation and reciprocity. While she has the right to keep the baby's name private due to her superstitions, her overall attitude is problematic. She dismisses her sister's sacrifices with ""I didn't ask her to help me,"" shows no initiative in maintaining the relationship post-crisis, and makes excuses about why she can't visit while expecting her sister (who has 4 children) to come to her instead.

The sister's hurt feelings are understandable - she made major sacrifices and now feels taken for granted. While asking for the baby's name specifically might seem like a small thing to get upset about, it appears to represent a larger pattern where the author takes without giving back emotionally or relationally.

The author seems to have a transactional view of the help received rather than recognizing it as an act of love that deserves ongoing gratitude and relationship investment.

You made an understandable mistake - when cleaning thoroughly (which you were doing as a favor), you moved or discarded some of his papers without asking first. This was inconsiderate, and you appropriately acknowledged the error and apologized.

However, your boyfriend's response is concerning. While initial frustration about lost items is understandable, his behavior escalated far beyond what's reasonable:
- Yelling at you instead of working together to solve the problem
- Refusing your offers to help fix the situation
- Making repeated demanding phone calls
- Claiming your apology was ""weak"" and demanding you ""make it up to him""
- Calling you manipulative when you tried to address the issue maturely
- Insisting ""anyone"" would react the same way (which isn't true)

His reaction suggests he's more interested in punishing you than resolving the problem. Healthy relationships involve working together through mistakes, not one partner berating the other and refusing reasonable solutions.

The author seems to be holding themselves to an unrealistic standard of pure altruism. Most people who donate have mixed motivations, and that doesn't negate the good they're doing.

The parents made a significant planning error by booking (or planning to book) a family vacation without consulting their child about important dates in their life. A one-year anniversary is a meaningful milestone in a relationship, and the girlfriend has already made sacrifices by having her family delay their vacation to accommodate this date. The parents' response of ""you can spend time with her when we get back"" shows a dismissive attitude toward their child's relationship and commitments.

Additionally, the parents are now using guilt tactics to pressure compliance rather than engaging in constructive dialogue about finding a solution. While parents certainly have the right to plan family activities, completely disregarding their child's important personal commitments and then emotionally manipulating them when they object crosses into unreasonable territory.

The author appears to be communicating their concerns respectfully and has legitimate reasons for not wanting to go. While some might argue they should be more flexible about celebrating an anniversary on a different date, they've already made commitments based on this date, and their girlfriend has made sacrifices to honor it.

The parents could have easily avoided this conflict by having a simple conversation about dates before making plans, or by being more understanding and collaborative when the conflict was brought to their attention.

The author has legitimate reasons for not wanting to participate in graduation - they're introverted, dislike attention, face practical challenges with distance and work scheduling, and have limited time off. These are reasonable personal boundaries and preferences.

The family members (mom, boyfriend, grandmother) are coming from a place of love and pride. The mother is excited because this is a significant family milestone - the first person to earn a degree. The grandmother wants to celebrate this achievement publicly. The boyfriend is trying to encourage compromise to maintain family harmony. Their enthusiasm, while overwhelming to the author, stems from genuine care and pride.

This appears to be a classic case of different personality types and values clashing. The family values public celebration and shared joy, while the author values privacy and personal comfort. Neither approach is inherently wrong.

The family could be more understanding of the author's introversion and practical constraints. The author could potentially consider small compromises. But fundamentally, this is about different people having different comfort levels and priorities around celebration, which is normal and doesn't make anyone a bad person.

The author expressed legitimate concerns about:
- Cat privacy and welfare (noting the cat appeared ""visibly distressed"")
- Personal boundaries about not wanting to watch such videos
- The appropriateness of filming pets during private moments

The author communicated these concerns politely initially and set reasonable boundaries.

The girlfriend:
- Engaged in behavior that made the cat visibly distressed
- Dismissed the author's concerns about animal welfare
- Tried to pressure the author into watching content they found uncomfortable
- Was somewhat dismissive with responses like ""it's so cute though"" and ""jeez""

However, the girlfriend did ultimately agree to stop the behavior when firmly asked.

The core issue here involves animal welfare and personal boundaries. The author was advocating for the cat's wellbeing and their own comfort level, while the girlfriend was initially dismissive of these valid concerns. The author's request was reasonable and their approach, while firm at the end, was appropriate given the circumstances.

Your uncle's alcoholism isn't just a personal preference - it's a medical condition where exposure to alcohol can trigger relapse, potentially leading to serious health consequences, damaged relationships, or even death. Recovery from addiction is an ongoing daily struggle, and family gatherings can already be stressful situations that increase vulnerability.

Your mother, as the host, is trying to create a safe environment for all her guests, including her brother who is in recovery. This shows care and understanding of how addiction works. While I understand your perspective about wanting wine with dinner, framing this as ""unfair"" to you minimizes the very real health risks your uncle faces.

The fact that you're ""taking issue"" with your mother's reasonable boundary to protect a family member's sobriety suggests a lack of understanding about addiction and recovery. There are many ways to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner, and wine isn't essential to the celebration.

The author's concern for their friend's wellbeing comes from a place of love, especially given the friend's recent struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts.

The author is planning a very small, intimate wedding (25 people total) after a previous wedding planning experience that contributed to relationship difficulties. They've established clear, consistent criteria for their guest list - only immediate family (10 people) and closest friends (15 people).

This level of reaction to a first-time visit from a 6-month partner to a casual retail environment seems disproportionate, especially when:
- They've been together 6 months (not a brand new relationship)
- The author genuinely needed art supplies 
- The work environment is described as very relaxed
- This was a first-time occurrence, not a pattern

While some people prefer to keep work and personal life separate, the boyfriend's reaction goes beyond simply expressing that preference. His language was harsh and accusatory rather than communicative. A more reasonable response would have been to explain his boundaries calmly.

The author made an innocent mistake in judgment about what would be welcome, but their intentions were good and the action itself wasn't inherently problematic given the context.

The boyfriend was acting suspiciously when asked for a simple time check, which naturally raised questions. When directly asked if he was hiding something and told that checking his phone shouldn't be a problem if there was nothing to hide, he ""reluctantly agrees"" and stands with the author while she checks the messages. This constitutes clear permission, even if reluctant.

Most importantly, the phone check revealed that he was violating a clearly established boundary - the author had explicitly stated she was uncomfortable with underage drinking and didn't want to support it, which he had agreed to respect. Instead, he was secretly facilitating underage drinking by ferrying alcohol.

The boyfriend's reaction is telling: he first apologizes when caught, but then shifts to anger about privacy invasion when his apologies don't achieve the desired effect. This appears to be deflection from his own wrongdoing - lying about respecting an important boundary and then trying to make the author feel guilty for discovering his deception.

The author's protective instincts toward their partner are understandable - wanting to avoid a situation where they might encounter someone who assaulted their partner is a natural response. However, there are several concerning aspects to their approach:

1. The author made this decision unilaterally while drunk, essentially giving their partner an ultimatum about avoiding her own community gathering
2. They threatened potential violence (""if I was drunk and something escalated I wouldn't be able to control myself""), which puts additional pressure on their partner
3. They seem to have withdrawn from further discussion after being told it would be ""mortifying for the community""

The partner is dealing with complex trauma and community dynamics. She's navigating a situation where she was previously silenced and ostracized, and now faces pressure from her current partner to avoid community events. Her concern about community mortification suggests she's still dealing with the social fallout from her assault.

However, both parties failed to have a proper, sober conversation about this sensitive issue. The author jumped to conclusions and made threats, while the partner didn't engage in working through this complex situation together.

Your boyfriend's behavior during serious conversations - particularly continuing to play during an important relationship discussion after you explicitly asked him to stop - shows a concerning lack of respect for you and the relationship. When someone asks for your full attention during a serious conversation, especially about relationship issues, the appropriate response is to give that attention, not to simply lower the game volume while continuing to play.

The pattern of interrupting conversations with gaming outbursts and then asking ""what was that last part?"" also demonstrates that he's not truly present or engaged when you're trying to communicate.

However, you acknowledge that you haven't directly communicated how his gaming habits affect you, which is an important factor. Clear communication about boundaries and needs is essential in any relationship.

While both parties could improve their communication, the boyfriend's behavior during the serious argument - refusing to fully disengage from gaming when explicitly asked during a relationship discussion - crosses a line of basic respect that makes him primarily at fault for this specific conflict.

Your girlfriend just lost her father after being his sole caregiver for years during an incredibly difficult illness. She's 19, handling funeral arrangements alone, and is in a vulnerable state of grief. This is one of the most significant moments in her life where she needs support from her partner.

While I understand that the funeral format conflicts with your religious beliefs, this isn't about your comfort or religious preferences - it's about being there for someone you care about during their darkest hour. The funeral is honoring her father's explicitly stated wishes, which she is trying to fulfill while grieving.

Your offer to ""drop her off and pick her up"" treats this like a casual event rather than recognizing the gravity of what she's going through. Being physically present during the service itself is a fundamental way partners support each other through major life events, especially death of a parent.

Your religious discomfort, while valid as a personal feeling, doesn't outweigh the basic expectation of partnership support during grief.

The author has been harboring romantic feelings for 3 years despite a clear rejection. While having feelings isn't inherently wrong, several concerning patterns emerge:

1. He continues pursuing someone who explicitly said no to romance
2. He constantly expresses his feelings through compliments despite sensing her discomfort
3. While drunk, he made physical contact (kissing her cheek) and declared his love again
4. He's created an uncomfortable dynamic where she feels obligated to help him (walking him home) despite his persistent romantic pursuit

The friend has been clear about her boundaries - she said no to romance and wants to remain friends. She's been patient and kind, even helping him get home safely when drunk.

However, the author does show some self-awareness by recognizing her discomfort with compliments and stopping them, and by questioning whether he overstepped boundaries.

The core issue is that he's not respecting her ""no"" and continues to pursue her romantically while claiming to value the friendship. His drunken behavior crossed physical boundaries, even if the cheek kisses might seem minor.

While his feelings are understandable, his actions show a pattern of not fully respecting her clearly stated boundaries.

You're describing a pattern where your wife's family members become problematic when drinking - the step-dad cursed at your child, the sister criticized your parenting despite having no children, and the mother was rude about your household arrangements. Additionally, you have concerns about the boyfriend who has apparent alcohol and relationship issues. With your wife being pregnant and young children in the home, your concerns about creating a safe, peaceful environment seem legitimate.

As the homeowner and host, you have the right to set reasonable rules for guests staying in your house, especially when their past behavior while drinking has been disruptive and inappropriate toward your family. The fact that the mother-in-law went 5 weeks without drinking when the step-dad wasn't there suggests it's possible for them to abstain.

Your request isn't unreasonable - you're not asking them to quit drinking permanently, just to refrain while staying as guests in your home where their drinking has previously caused problems. You're trying to protect your children, pregnant wife, and maintain peace in your own household.

The girlfriend's behavior is contradictory and concerning - she claims to be insecure about other men not wanting her while simultaneously bragging about multiple guys pursuing her and accepting Valentine's gifts from four different men.

However, the author's response was also problematic. Telling someone to ""stop faking their insecurities"" is dismissive and invalidating, even when their behavior seems contradictory. Insecurities can be complex and don't always manifest logically. The author could have addressed the contradictory behavior without completely dismissing her feelings.

Both parties seem to be handling this conflict poorly - she's sending mixed messages and engaging in attention-seeking behavior that undermines the relationship, while he's responding with dismissiveness rather than constructive communication about the real issues (her accepting gifts from other men and posting about dates).

Your friend is facing a genuine crisis - divorce due to infidelity is emotionally devastating, and needing housing is a legitimate emergency. As a close friend, there's naturally some expectation that you'd help if reasonably able.

However, you're not obligated to sacrifice your own relationship and living situation for an extended period (6 months to a year is quite long). Your concerns about how a friend with a ""big personality"" might impact your developing relationship are valid and reasonable. You have a right to prioritize your own romantic relationship and living situation.

The key factors that make this ""nobody's fault"":
- Your friend isn't wrong for asking - he's in crisis and reaching out for help
- You're not wrong for having reservations about a long-term arrangement that could negatively impact your relationship
- Your girlfriend isn't involved in creating this dilemma
- This is simply a difficult situation with competing valid needs

A reasonable middle ground (offering short-term help while he finds other arrangements) would be considerate without requiring you to make major sacrifices. You're not overthinking this - these are legitimate concerns about a significant commitment.

The sister is 9th grade (around 14-15 years old) with no experience in yard work, and the physical demands may genuinely be beyond her current capabilities. The author didn't dismiss her outright - they actually gave her a chance to prove herself through the trial run.

The core issue is that you're treating your children differently based on their weight in a way that could cause significant psychological harm. A 9-year-old doesn't have the emotional maturity to understand why she's being singled out, and this differential treatment could lead to shame, resentment toward her siblings, and an unhealthy relationship with food that persists into adulthood.

While your intention to address weight concerns is understandable, the execution creates an unfair family dynamic. Your daughter is likely to feel punished for something largely outside her control (genetics, metabolism), while watching her siblings freely enjoy foods she's denied. This could foster feelings of inadequacy and damage her self-esteem during crucial developmental years.

A better approach would involve the whole family adopting healthier eating habits together, consulting with pediatric nutrition experts, and focusing on overall health rather than weight restriction for one child.

Nail clipping for cats is a completely normal, veterinarian-recommended practice for indoor cats. It's much more humane than declawing and helps prevent damage to furniture, people, and the cats themselves. The author is experiencing painful scratches and found an effective, safe solution.

The boyfriend's opposition seems to stem from personal preference rather than any legitimate concern for the cats' wellbeing. His reaction of getting ""pissy"" when the author clips the nails suggests he's being unreasonably stubborn about a standard pet care practice. The fact that he ""gave up"" but continues to show displeasure indicates passive-aggressive behavior rather than genuine compromise.

The author is taking responsible action to care for the cats and protect themselves from injury. They're not doing anything harmful - quite the opposite. The boyfriend's resistance to basic pet care that benefits everyone (cats, humans, and furniture) appears to be the main source of conflict.

The author has clearly communicated their position - they don't want religious ceremonies for their child, which is their right as a parent. They've made a reasonable decision based on their own beliefs and comfort level, even acknowledging that the ceremonies are ""virtually harmless.""

The family is understandably disappointed about missing out on important religious traditions, but their response seems disproportionate. While it's natural for them to feel hurt, refusing to attend the baby shower appears to be an attempt to pressure the author into compliance through emotional manipulation. The baby shower refusal seems particularly petty since it's punishing the author (and potentially the wife) for a decision they have every right to make as parents.

The author has been respectful in their communication, acknowledged their family's feelings, and even understood their perspective to some degree. The family, while having legitimate feelings about tradition, is responding in a way that creates unnecessary conflict and division during what should be a celebratory time.

The core issue isn't about religious differences - it's about respecting parental autonomy and responding maturely to disappointment.

I felt like it was one of those things you just have to...,Other,Author,0.8,0.5625,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the boundaries, communication, and actions of both parties.

The author's girlfriend clearly established a boundary - she didn't want to participate in the peep show but was okay with her partner going alone. The author respected this initially by going in solo. However, when the opportunity arose to go into a booth with a stranger instead of experiencing it alone as originally discussed, the author made a choice that crossed into new territory without checking with her girlfriend first.

While the author's intention seems innocent (making the experience less awkward), going into an intimate/sexual setting with another person - even briefly - represents a significant change from the original agreement. The girlfriend had consented to her partner going alone, not to her partner sharing an intimate experience with someone else.

The author's argument that ""if she had just come in with me none of this would've happened"" shifts blame rather than taking responsibility for the choice made in the moment. The girlfriend had already clearly communicated her boundaries, and it wasn't reasonable to expect her to compromise her comfort level.

The girlfriend's delayed reaction doesn't invalidate her feelings - sometimes it takes time to process situations, especially after discussing with friends who might offer different perspectives.

The author made a decision that went beyond the agreed-upon boundaries without consultation, even if unintentionally.

The girlfriend made a significant mistake by unilaterally changing plans without consulting her partner first. After initially agreeing to go to her family's house alone so he could study, she then invited everyone to their shared space while he was on the phone - essentially ambushing him with a major change that directly impacted his ability to prepare for exams the next day. This shows a lack of respect for both his academic needs and their shared living space.

However, the author also bears some responsibility. His admission that he hasn't been ""responsive or warm"" toward her family and struggles with communication due to language barriers suggests he may have created an unwelcoming atmosphere over time. While his immediate concern about studying was valid, his pattern of behavior toward her family likely contributed to the tension.

The girlfriend's defensive reaction calling him ""selfish"" and claiming he has ""no respect for her family"" seems disproportionate to his reasonable request to maintain the original plan, but it may reflect built-up frustration from his previous coldness toward her family.

The author did attempt to compromise by offering to study elsewhere and return for dinner, which shows some willingness to work together, but by then the damage to communication was done.

Both parties failed to communicate effectively and consider each other's perspectives, leading to this conflict.

The author received what appears to be permission from their boyfriend (""you do you""), but there are several concerning elements:

1. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive rather than enthusiastic consent for opening the relationship
2. The author notes this ""previously never would've been okay,"" suggesting a sudden change that may not reflect genuine comfort
3. There's no indication of proper discussion about boundaries, expectations, or mutual agreement about the arrangement
4. The casual nature of ""you do you"" doesn't suggest the kind of thorough communication typically needed for healthy non-monogamy

However, the author did bring up the topic and received what could be interpreted as permission. The boyfriend had the opportunity to express concerns or set boundaries but chose not to.

The author isn't being disrespectful to the deceased or the family - they're simply grappling with a common ethical dilemma about whether charitable giving should align with one's personal beliefs, even when done in someone else's honor. They're considering multiple respectful alternatives (donating elsewhere in his name or not donating at all) rather than being dismissive.

The family and girlfriend aren't at fault either - they're grieving and have every right to suggest a charity that was meaningful to their loved one. This is a perfectly reasonable request on their part.

Your mother's behavior shows a clear pattern of inconsistency and manipulation. She claims poverty while spending thousands on strangers, uses guilt tactics about her financial limitations, and has created an unhealthy dynamic where love equals money. Her response to legitimate concerns by hanging up shows she's avoiding accountability.

However, your response, while understandable given the frustration, was quite harsh. Calling her out so directly about ""not loving"" her children and demanding she say she ""doesn't want to spend money"" on you was confrontational, even if the underlying points about honesty were valid.

Your siblings also contributed to escalating the situation with sarcastic comments, though their frustration is equally understandable.

The family you mention seems to be taking advantage of your mother's generosity by bringing a prepared list, but they're responding to an opportunity she created and continues to enable.

Your mother bears the primary responsibility for creating this toxic dynamic through years of equating love with money, being inconsistent with her stated financial limitations, and manipulating her children with guilt.

The key facts are:
- The girlfriend gave him a GameCube as a gift, but it came without essential components (cables and power supply)
- Finding compatible parts separately would be challenging and potentially problematic (third-party power supplies could cause issues)
- His friend with gaming expertise recommended getting a complete GameCube instead
- The girlfriend herself said she understands and wouldn't be offended
- The housemates are calling him ungrateful

The author's approach seems reasonable and considerate:
- He accepted the gift graciously initially
- He researched options thoroughly before making a decision
- He consulted with someone knowledgeable about gaming equipment
- Most importantly, he discussed it openly with his girlfriend, who gave her blessing
- He plans to keep her gift as a backup, showing he still values it

The housemates appear to be making judgments without full understanding of the technical challenges involved or the girlfriend's own perspective on the matter. Since the girlfriend - the actual gift-giver - has no issue with his plan, their criticism seems misplaced.

The author is being practical while still showing appreciation for the original gift. Getting a complete, functional GameCube while keeping the girlfriend's gift as backup is a sensible solution that respects both the gift and his gaming needs.

The wife clearly lied about being a virgin and having no romantic experience. This was a significant deception that lasted 5+ years of relationship and marriage. Dishonesty about sexual history, especially when directly asked, is a serious breach of trust in a relationship.

However, the husband's reaction reveals some concerning attitudes. His statement that he feels ""not even that special for her anymore sexually"" and like ""just another guy when it comes to sex"" suggests he places a woman's worth and the value of their relationship on her sexual inexperience. His immediate jump to separation over learning about her past (rather than focusing on the dishonesty aspect) indicates some problematic views about women and sexuality.

The wife's dishonesty was wrong, but it may have stemmed from shame about her past and fear of exactly this kind of reaction. The husband's response suggests her fears may have been justified, though that doesn't excuse the deception.

Both parties contributed to this situation - she through significant dishonesty, and he through what appears to be judgmental attitudes about women's sexual pasts that likely created an environment where she felt she couldn't be truthful.

The author's concerns seem to stem from three main points:
1. Feeling hurt that she didn't discuss it with him first
2. Feeling inadequate that he can't afford to take her on nice trips
3. Being sad that their rare free weekend together would be spent apart

The author approached this sensitively - he explicitly stated he wasn't trying to be controlling or jealous, he supported her going, and he communicated his feelings gently. His girlfriend's response (crying and offering not to go) suggests she understood his perspective and didn't view his concerns as unreasonable.

However, there are some issues with the author's expectations:
- Expecting to be consulted about social plans with friends could be seen as slightly controlling, even if well-intentioned
- His financial insecurities, while understandable, aren't really his girlfriend's responsibility to manage
- In healthy relationships, partners should be able to maintain independent social lives

That said, the author handled this maturely by communicating openly rather than bottling up his feelings, and he ultimately supported her decision to go. The girlfriend also handled it well by being understanding of his feelings.

This seems like a normal relationship moment where someone had mixed feelings about something and communicated about it appropriately. Neither person did anything particularly wrong.

The author made several significant mistakes:
1. Pursued a romantic/sexual relationship with a straight friend while knowing he wasn't interested in that way
2. Framed a serious proposition as ""a joke"" when they actually meant it
3. Most importantly, violated their friend's privacy by telling ""half of my friends"" about their intimate encounter without consent

However, the friend also bears responsibility:

2. Enthusiastically agreed to and participated in the sexual encounter
3. Made extensive preparations (scheduling hotel, buying condoms, etc.)
4. Then completely cut off contact and blocked the author without any communication about what went wrong

The friend's sudden complete withdrawal and refusal to communicate, even after apologies, seems disproportionate if the only issue was the author telling friends.

The author demonstrated significant accommodation and compromise throughout the relationship:
- Accepted her boyfriend's furry interest despite it not being her thing
- Participated in activities she wasn't personally into (including intimate situations)
- Tolerated increasingly disruptive behavior (sleeping on the sofa due to heat from the fursuit)
- Only drew a boundary when it came to public family gatherings

Her boundary about not wearing the fursuit to meet her family and elderly relatives was reasonable - she wasn't asking him to stop being a furry, just to dress appropriately for a specific social context with people who might not understand.

The boyfriend's behavior became increasingly problematic:
- Escalated demands (wanting her to buy a fursuit to be ""mates"")
- Refused to compromise on appropriate social contexts
- Used inflammatory language (calling her ""racist"" and a slur)
- Engaged in public guilt-tripping and social media harassment after the breakup

While relationships require mutual acceptance, they also require mutual respect and reasonable boundaries. The author showed extensive acceptance while maintaining one reasonable boundary. The boyfriend's response was disproportionate and included verbal abuse and ongoing harassment.

- The friend is backing out in December (about a month later) due to financial concerns
- The author paid upfront and is asking for either payment of their share or help finding an alternative
- The friend wants the group to either absorb the cost or find a new place themselves

This appears to be a reasonable disagreement about group booking etiquette. The author's position is understandable - they fronted the money based on everyone's commitment, and when someone backs out, it's fair to expect either payment or assistance in finding alternatives. The friend's financial constraints are also understandable, but backing out after a commitment was made does create a burden for others.

However, the author is offering reasonable solutions (pay the share OR help find alternative accommodation), while the friend is expecting others to absorb both the financial impact and the work of finding alternatives.

Your friend has been consistently boastful about his intelligence for months, spending significant portions of your hangouts talking about how superior he is intellectually. This behavior is clearly annoying and arrogant. However, the key issue is how the conflict escalated during your roasting session.

In friendly roasting between friends, there's typically an unspoken understanding about boundaries and proportional responses. Your friend made a comment about your physical appearance, which while potentially hurtful, was relatively surface-level. Your response with the ""ego to IQ"" line was clever but struck directly at something he's clearly very sensitive about - his perceived intelligence, which seems to be core to his identity.

When he got upset, instead of recognizing you'd hit a nerve and perhaps backing off or apologizing, you doubled down and delivered a much harsher critique about his life circumstances, abilities, and self-perception. This moved well beyond friendly roasting into genuinely hurtful territory.

While your friend's constant bragging is obnoxious and his reaction was oversensitive, you escalated a playful exchange into a serious personal attack.

While the author did give a warning about resorting to violence if snow was thrown at them, there are several concerning factors:

1. **Disproportionate response**: Having snow rubbed on one's face, while unwanted, is typically considered playful behavior among friends. Responding with three punches to the head that knocked someone to the ground represents a severe escalation.

2. **Excessive force**: The response went far beyond what would be reasonable for the ""threat"" posed by having snow rubbed on their face.

3. **Abandonment**: Leaving after knocking someone to the ground shows a lack of concern for the consequences of their actions.

However, the friend who rubbed snow on the author's face also bears some responsibility for:
- Ignoring a clear boundary that was explicitly stated
- Initiating unwanted physical contact despite the warning

The other two friends don't appear to have done anything wrong - they were just having their own snowball fight.

The author witnessed what appeared to be an elderly person on the ground at a supermarket. While they were uncertain whether it was a fall or intentional sitting, there were clear indicators this warranted concern:

1. An elderly person was on the ground in an unusual location (supermarket)
2. The helper/daughter was asking her to stand up
3. When offered help by a third person, the elderly woman accepted it

The author's hesitation is somewhat understandable given the ambiguous nature of what they observed. However, when someone elderly is on the ground in a public place, the default response should be to offer assistance or at least inquire if help is needed, regardless of how it might appear. The potential harm of not helping someone who genuinely needs it outweighs the awkwardness of offering help to someone who doesn't want it.

The author's comparison to ""not getting involved with a toddler throwing a fit"" shows a concerning lack of recognition that elderly people may have complex medical, cognitive, or physical issues that aren't immediately apparent. The fact that the elderly woman ultimately accepted help from the third person suggests she did need assistance.

The author's perspective: He has a long-standing, meaningful friendship that predates his romantic relationship. He values loyalty and doesn't want to abandon someone who supported him through difficult times like his mother's passing.

However, the author made several problematic choices:
- Called his female friend his ""soulmate"" to his fiancée during an argument
- Said his love for his friend ""goes beyond just being a best friend"" 
- Dismissed his fiancée's emotional responses as manipulative crying ""to get her way""
- Showed little empathy for how his words and actions might reasonably upset someone he's planning to marry

The fiancée's perspective: She's uncomfortable with her partner's close relationship with another woman, which became more concerning after engagement. Her discomfort escalated to inappropriate behavior.

Her problematic actions include:
- Making cruel comments that nearly brought the friend to tears
- Being hostile and confrontational rather than communicating constructively
- Asking the author to exclude his friend from their wedding

While the fiancée's jealousy and poor communication are issues, the author's language about loving another woman and calling her his ""soulmate"" crosses reasonable boundaries for most romantic partnerships. His dismissive attitude toward his fiancée's concerns and his apparent lack of awareness about how his words sound also contribute significantly to this conflict.

Both parties handled this poorly, but the author's choice of words and dismissive attitude toward his partner's legitimate concerns about his relationship language make him more at fault.

The author, as the leaseholder, has legitimate concerns about:
- The cat's health and welfare (untreated fleas, no vet check)
- Potential property damage and cleaning costs
- The roommate's pattern of financial irresponsibility
- Finding care for the cat when the roommate travels

The author is trying to balance being considerate (not wanting to be an ""asshole"") with practical concerns about an animal that isn't receiving proper care. The author even acknowledges liking the cat, showing this isn't about disliking animals.

While the roommate's intentions were good in rescuing the cat, good intentions don't excuse taking on responsibilities you cannot fulfill. The cat deserves proper veterinary care, and the living situation needs to be manageable for everyone involved.

The author's suggestion of finding the cat a temporary home until the roommate moves out seems like a reasonable compromise that prioritizes the cat's welfare.

The behaviors described - excessive copying, creating drama when not invited to events, dumping responsibilities on others, paranoid checking and rechecking of plans, and using guilt-tripping tactics - are problematic friendship dynamics that would strain any relationship. The author has attempted to communicate boundaries (explaining the stress of having responsibilities dumped on them) but has been met with anger and dismissal.

The friend's response of calling the author a ""bad friend"" while simultaneously refusing to end the friendship when given the opportunity, along with claiming other friends think the author is ""an asshole"" but that she's ""too nice"" to leave, suggests manipulative behavior patterns.

The author appears to be trying to maintain the friendship while setting reasonable boundaries, and is now considering creating some distance rather than ending the friendship entirely - which seems like a measured response to an unhealthy dynamic.

While transitions can be stressful and may explain some behavioral changes, they don't excuse manipulative or boundary-violating behavior in friendships.

The rest was from quizzes ...,Other,Other,0.8,0.7272727272727273,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the legitimate concerns and constraints of both parties.

The author had valid reasons for concern:
- 60% of their grade was ungraded for most of the semester
- They were approaching the drop deadline without knowing their standing
- Feedback is crucial for improvement on subsequent assignments
- They're paying for educational services

The professor also had legitimate constraints:
- Suffered serious injuries (broken wrists) that directly impacted her ability to grade
- Was dealing with a traumatic situation
- May have had limited institutional support or alternatives

However, the key issue is how this situation was handled institutionally. When a professor cannot fulfill core teaching duties due to injury, the university should have protocols in place - such as providing a teaching assistant, arranging for dictated grading, finding a substitute grader, or potentially postponing/canceling the course.

The author's email was reasonable given the circumstances and timeline. The professor's ""furious"" response, while understandable given her stress, was unprofessional. But the real failure here seems to be at the institutional level - the university should have stepped in to ensure students received the educational services they were paying for.

This appears to be primarily a systemic failure where proper support structures weren't in place or utilized.

The author has been with his girlfriend for more than a year, which is a significant relationship duration. His girlfriend wants him to attend her son's birthday party to meet her family - this is a reasonable request that shows she's trying to integrate him into her life and family circle. Family events, especially a child's birthday, are important milestones in blended family situations.

While the author has the right to decline social events, his reasoning seems problematic. He prioritizes watching football with friends over what his girlfriend clearly considers an important relationship step. He admits he ""would probably go if I didn't already want to do something else,"" suggesting his football plans aren't particularly significant commitments.

The author also shows concerning attitudes - he questions whether he's ""obligated"" to attend and seems dismissive of the importance this holds for his girlfriend. After a year together, showing up for significant family events demonstrates commitment and respect for the relationship.

His girlfriend's frustration is understandable given that she's trying to deepen their relationship by including him in family occasions, and he's choosing recreational activities over this meaningful step.

The author appears to be prioritizing his casual preferences over his relationship's growth and his partner's reasonable expectations.

The author is dealing with their own mental health challenges while trying to navigate their father's severe bipolar disorder and overwhelming communication patterns.

The author is following medical advice from their doctor to reduce engagement with the problematic texting behavior. This isn't about abandoning their father, but about not enabling patterns that discourage treatment-seeking. The father's condition appears to be untreated, and his excessive messaging (7 lengthy texts at a time with demands for specific responses) creates an unsustainable dynamic.

While I understand the author's guilt about not explaining their reduced communication, doing so could potentially escalate the situation or create more pressure. The author is also managing their own mental health needs, which is necessary for them to be able to help anyone else long-term.

The father isn't truly ""at fault"" either - severe untreated bipolar disorder significantly impacts judgment and behavior. This appears to be a tragic situation where mental illness is creating harmful patterns for everyone involved.

The core issues are:

2. Misusing the emergency key privilege by allowing regular social visits
3. Guests using the author's bathroom while the roommate isn't even home to host them
4. Creating noise disturbances when the roommate isn't there to manage her guests

These are legitimate concerns about safety, privacy, and basic roommate etiquette. The author has every right to feel uncomfortable with unaccompanied strangers in their home and to request this behavior stop. The roommate should be present when hosting guests, and emergency keys shouldn't be used for regular social gatherings.

The new member came to the author expressing frustration about not receiving helpful feedback and feeling stuck with her performance. She was clearly looking for guidance and support from someone in a leadership position. However, the author's response was dismissive and harsh - essentially telling her to ""buck up"" rather than offering constructive help or empathy.

As speech captain, the author had a responsibility to provide actual guidance and support to team members, especially new ones. Instead of offering specific feedback, suggesting resources, or even just listening supportively, the author chose to be blunt in a way that was clearly unhelpful and hurtful.

The author acknowledges being ""not the most empathetic person"" and that making the teammate cry ""didn't exactly faze"" them, which suggests a lack of appropriate emotional response to causing distress to someone seeking help.

While the author may have intended to give ""reality,"" there's a significant difference between honest feedback and dismissive harshness, especially when someone is in a vulnerable state asking for help.

The new team member's frustration and emotional response seem entirely reasonable given the circumstances - she was struggling, sought help from a leader, and was essentially told to figure it out herself in a dismissive manner.

The author made multiple attempts to coordinate decorating together, asking repeatedly over several days and being met with various excuses without any alternative timing being offered. When someone consistently says ""not now"" without proposing when they would be available, it's reasonable to interpret that as lack of genuine interest, especially when they had previously expressed enthusiasm about the project.

The husband's reaction when he came home - getting angry and saying ""What the fuck is the point?"" - was disproportionate and hurtful. He had ample opportunity to either participate when asked or to proactively suggest alternative timing. His response suggests he expected the author to wait indefinitely for his convenience without clear communication about his actual intentions.

While the author could have been more direct about setting a deadline (""I'm planning to do this by X date with or without you""), their frustration was understandable given the repeated delays and lack of clear communication from the husband.

The instructor was dealing with a disruptive student who was undermining the class, spreading dangerous misconceptions about self-defense, and depriving other students of their learning experience. The hands-on demonstration appears to be standard practice in this type of training, and the instructor did obtain consent and explain the process beforehand.

However, there are some concerning elements. Using a disruptive student as an example in front of the class could be seen as punitive rather than educational. The instructor acknowledged feeling the need to prove a point to someone with a challenging attitude, which suggests the demonstration may have been motivated partly by frustration rather than purely educational purposes.

That said, the student agreed to participate after having the scenario explained twice, and the instructor stopped immediately when asked. The reality-based nature of self-defense training often requires uncomfortable but necessary demonstrations to dispel dangerous misconceptions that could cost someone their life.

The student's disruptive behavior was problematic and potentially dangerous to other participants' learning, but the instructor's response, while technically following protocol, may have crossed into using the demonstration as a way to ""put her in her place"" rather than purely for educational benefit.

The author found the shirt first and was genuinely considering purchasing it. Letting a friend try it on while still deciding doesn't constitute giving up claim to an item. However, the phrase ""up to him"" was ambiguous and reasonably could be interpreted as relinquishing interest in the purchase.

The friend's interpretation wasn't unreasonable given the context - being asked to try on the shirt and then being told it was ""up to him"" could logically suggest the author was no longer interested. However, the friend became ""really mad"" and insisted the shirt was ""forfeited,"" which seems like an overreaction to what was clearly a misunderstanding.

Both parties failed to communicate clearly about their intentions. The author should have been more explicit about still considering the purchase, and the friend should have asked for clarification rather than assuming ownership. Neither party handled the miscommunication particularly well when it arose.

The author stood up his coworker on Valentine's Day by literally giving away his date to a stranger at the restaurant, leaving her sitting alone without any explanation or communication. This caused her to spend Valentine's Day with a complete stranger instead of her intended date, which could have been confusing, embarrassing, or even potentially unsafe for her.

While I understand the author was struggling with severe mental health issues stemming from past abuse, and his self-doubt and anxiety are understandable given his circumstances, his method of handling the situation was problematic. There were many other ways he could have addressed his anxiety - he could have communicated with her beforehand, asked to reschedule, or even explained his nervousness when he arrived. Instead, he made a unilateral decision that affected her evening without her knowledge or consent.

The fact that she was gracious about it afterward and they continued dating doesn't excuse the initial action. His mental health struggles provide context for why he acted this way, but they don't absolve him of responsibility for the impact of his choices on another person.

- Waited a full month before even considering bringing up the dinner
- Are clearly not angry or upset about the situation

The author's husband has the right to make decisions about his own appearance, including growing a beard.

The author's initial approach about the towel smell was reasonable and tactful - they addressed a legitimate hygiene issue that was affecting their shared living space in a respectful way. Turning off an unattended heater that was producing concerning smells was also a reasonable safety precaution, especially since the roommate had a pattern of leaving it on when absent.

However, the roommate's reactions have been extremely disproportionate. Getting defensive about the towel issue is understandable, but responding with weeks of passive-aggressive behavior (slamming doors, deliberately disrupting sleep), making threats about wanting to ""choke"" someone, and calling campus police over a heater being turned off for safety reasons crosses well into unreasonable territory.

While the author could potentially have handled the heater situation by waiting to discuss it when the roommate returned, their actions were motivated by legitimate safety concerns and were not malicious. The roommate's escalation to threats and involving authorities over minor issues shows a concerning pattern of overreaction.

Different families have different boundaries around physical affection and privacy - what seems inappropriate to one person may be completely normal to another.

The friend is now upset about a solution that gives him exactly what he wanted (maintaining the original group) while allowing the author to include his wife. This suggests the friend's issue may be more about control than about preserving ""guy time.""

The other friends don't appear to have done anything wrong - they simply expressed their preferences when asked.

The author states they only offered to ""look at"" the broken TV and explicitly hinted it wasn't worth fixing, suggesting the mother-in-law's sons should buy a replacement. However, the mother-in-law claims the author promised to ""sort her out either way,"" which implies a commitment to provide a solution regardless of whether the TV was repairable.

This seems like a genuine misunderstanding where both parties may have interpreted the conversation differently. The author may have been trying to be helpful by offering to diagnose the problem, while the mother-in-law may have reasonably interpreted the offer as a commitment to ensure she had a working TV.

The wife is now caught in the middle and applying pressure based on what she believes was promised. Without being present for the original conversation, it's difficult to determine exactly what was said or implied.

This appears to be a case where clearer communication upfront could have prevented the current conflict, but neither party seems to have acted with malicious intent.

While your girlfriend's reaction was excessive and her method of handling it through repeated angry snaps was poor, the core issue stems from a lack of communication on your part. In a 4+ year relationship where you see each other regularly and have established routines, spontaneously going out with another person (especially someone of the opposite gender) without mentioning it beforehand shows a lack of consideration for your partner's feelings and the relationship dynamic.

You acknowledged that ""it hasn't crossed my mind to tell my girlfriend where I'm going or who I'm with"" - but in a committed long-term relationship, this kind of heads-up communication is generally expected and respectful. The fact that she had to discover this through Snapchat and then ask if you were alone suggests she felt blindsided.

Your girlfriend's jealousy issues and her method of expressing frustration through bombardment of messages were definitely problematic. However, her underlying concern about transparency in the relationship isn't unreasonable.

Both parties contributed to this conflict - you through lack of proactive communication, and her through poor emotional regulation and communication methods.

The author was dealing with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis, surgery, and chemotherapy - objectively one of the most serious medical and emotional crises a person can face. It's completely reasonable to expect significant support from a romantic partner during such a time, including visits during treatment and understanding about travel limitations.

The ex-girlfriend's response seems notably lacking in empathy and support. Expecting someone undergoing cancer treatment to make 5-hour drives to visit her, while not visiting them during surgery or chemo, shows a concerning lack of prioritization of the relationship and the severity of the medical situation. While medical school is indeed stressful, it doesn't typically involve life-threatening circumstances that require immediate emotional and practical support.

The author's frustration and ""calling out her character"" appears to be a direct response to feeling abandoned during a vulnerable time. While the delivery may not have been perfect, the core concern - that a partner should provide support during cancer treatment - is entirely valid.

The ex-girlfriend breaking up via text after the author expressed these legitimate needs further suggests she was unwilling to provide appropriate support during a medical crisis.

The boyfriend's response is deeply problematic. He ""attacked"" the tattoo, criticized something with personal significance to the author, and dictated what tattoos ""should be"" for other people to look at. This suggests controlling behavior and a lack of respect for the author's bodily autonomy and personal choices. His reaction was so negative that it made the author ""feel like shit"" about something meaningful to her.

However, the author did choose to lie rather than address the relationship issue directly. She admits this was wrong, and lying in relationships does create additional problems and breach trust.

That said, the power dynamic here is concerning. The boyfriend's extreme negative reaction and controlling attitude about the author's body and choices created an environment where she felt lying was her best option to avoid conflict. While lying isn't ideal, it's understandable as a response to what appears to be emotionally manipulative behavior.

The boyfriend's claim that ""everything would have been fine if I didn't lie"" is particularly telling - it deflects from his inappropriate initial reaction and controlling behavior by making the lie the central issue.

The core problem isn't the lie - it's the boyfriend's controlling attitude toward the author's personal choices about her own body.

The 14-year-old author was concerned about a safety issue (texting while driving on icy roads), which shows good awareness. However, their response was inappropriate and escalatory. Even after their father explicitly told them not to do anything, they deliberately disobeyed and made an offensive gesture toward another driver.

While texting and driving is dangerous and the other driver was engaging in risky behavior, the author's response was:
1. Disobedient to their parent's clear instruction
2. Inappropriate and potentially escalatory road rage behavior
3. Not constructive in addressing the safety concern

The father's grounding appears to be appropriate discipline for the disobedience and inappropriate behavior. The other driver was engaging in dangerous behavior, but that doesn't justify the author's response.

The author chose to act inappropriately despite being told not to, making them primarily at fault for the conflict that ensued.

Your friend has:
- Violated your privacy and trust by outing you without consent
- Engaged in deceptive behavior (cheating, lying to welfare, potentially stealing)
- Failed to reciprocate support in the friendship
- Avoided taking responsibility for their actions

While friendships naturally evolve and sometimes end, the specific behaviors you've described - particularly outing you as trans and the potential theft that damaged your family relationships - cross clear ethical boundaries. These aren't just matters of immaturity or different life paths, but actions that have caused real harm.

You've apparently tried to address these issues and encourage growth, but been met with deflection and excuses. At some point, recognizing when a friendship has become one-sided or harmful is reasonable self-preservation, not a character flaw.

- Making hurtful distinctions between ""biological"" and other grandchildren
- Dismissing her gay son's potential family options
- Being insensitive about her daughter's fertility struggles
- Calling her teenage child ""selfish"" for not wanting to provide grandchildren

While the author could have responded more diplomatically, their reaction is completely understandable given the inappropriate pressure and the offensive nature of the mother's comments. A 16-year-old telling their parent to ""shut up"" about such an inappropriate topic, while not ideal, is a reasonable response to being cornered about reproduction at the dinner table.

It seems worse ...",Other,Everybody,0.8,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I see a complex dynamic where both parties bear some responsibility, but to very different degrees.

The husband's behavior shows a clear pattern of emotional abuse and manipulation - threatening to hide assets and harm himself, giving ultimatums about money, shutting out his wife for days when angry, and refusing to seek treatment for his depression despite it severely impacting the family. While depression is a legitimate illness, it doesn't excuse abusive behavior or the refusal to get help when it's harming loved ones.

The author has made significant efforts to address the problems - moving out to create boundaries, insisting on couples therapy, and trying to support her husband through his struggles. However, she has also enabled some of these patterns by consistently accommodating his behavior and returning despite repeated cycles of improvement followed by regression.

The author's question ""when is it enough?"" suggests she recognizes this isn't sustainable, but she's been caught in a cycle of hoping things will change while accepting treatment that's damaging her physical and mental health.

While the husband bears primary responsibility for his abusive behavior and refusal to seek individual treatment, the author shares some responsibility for repeatedly accepting this dynamic without firmer boundaries.

The key factors here are:
- You're selling to a close friend (""my boy"")
- You have access to below-market prices through your connection
- You're considering a $10 markup while still offering a good deal
- There's an expectation that friends help each other out

While you're providing a service (using your connection, taking time to facilitate the transaction) and still offering below-market pricing, charging a markup to a close friend without being transparent about it violates the typical expectations of friendship. Friends generally expect either cost-sharing or upfront honesty about any fees.

The ethical approach would be to either:
1. Charge at-cost as a favor to your friend, or
2. Be transparent about your markup and reasoning

Since you're considering charging more without disclosure, this creates a trust issue in the friendship.

The friends appear to be acting in good faith - they're asking for help from someone they trust and presumably would be grateful for honest feedback. They haven't done anything wrong by seeking assistance or by having imperfect writing skills.

The author is uncomfortable with maintaining close friendships with people who cheat on their partners and wants to distance herself from them. This is a reasonable personal boundary based on her values - she's not trying to punish anyone or create drama, just choosing not to invest time in relationships that make her uncomfortable.

The two girls have a different perspective - they're able to compartmentalize the cheating behavior and maintain the friendships. They think the author is overreacting, but they're not being malicious or unreasonable in having different boundaries.

The boys are cheating on their girlfriends, which is clearly wrong behavior toward their romantic partners. However, in the context of this friendship situation, they haven't done anything specifically wrong to the author or the friend group - they shared information (perhaps unwisely) but weren't bragging or trying to involve others in their deception.

This appears to be a case where people have different moral boundaries and comfort levels, but no one is acting wrongfully toward each other within the friend group dynamic.

Friend C clearly committed theft - stealing $1000 from the author's parents and then justifying it by saying ""they're rich and it shouldn't matter."" This is objectively wrong both legally and morally.

The author's response seems reasonable - ending the friendship with the thief and being upset that their long-time friends A and B are treating this serious crime as ""not a big deal"" and refusing to take any stance on it.

Friends A and B's position of ""not wanting to pick sides"" when one side involves theft is problematic. While people can choose their own friends, their dismissive attitude toward a serious crime committed against their friend's family shows poor judgment and lack of loyalty to a long-term friendship.

The author gave an ultimatum, which some might see as extreme, but given that this involves theft from their family and their closest friends' indifferent response to it, their strong reaction is understandable.

The core issue here is Friend C's theft and Friends A and B's dismissive attitude toward a serious crime. The author is responding to being wronged and having their long-time friends minimize that wrong.

The mother's guilt-tripping responses (""another gift wasted,"" ""I knew you wouldn't like it"") suggest this is an ongoing dynamic where they set up situations to fail and then blame him for the predictable outcome.

While the author could have been more specific about gift preferences, his reasoning about not wanting to ruin the surprise element of Christmas is understandable. More importantly, his frustration seems rooted in a long-term pattern of feeling dismissed and undervalued rather than just this one incident.

The roommate's behavior was clearly problematic - he called the author names, mocked him for having no friends, and took his charger without permission. Taking someone's property, especially something they need for work, is theft and completely unacceptable.

However, the author's response was also problematic. Instead of addressing the theft directly (by demanding the charger back, involving authorities, or seeking mediation), he chose to retaliate by sabotaging $40 worth of his roommate's alcohol. This was destructive revenge that escalated the conflict rather than resolving it.

The author also made an initial threat to report underage drinking to the university, which while technically within his rights, was used as leverage in an argument rather than out of genuine concern for safety.

Both parties handled this poorly:
- The roommate resorted to personal attacks and theft

Student finance in the UK is specifically intended to support students' living costs and educational expenses during their studies. While there may not be explicit restrictions on every purchase, the funds are meant to help students cover essentials like accommodation, food, books, and basic living expenses while studying.

The author is using these funds - which come from taxpayers and will need to be repaid - to send money abroad to support a relative. This goes beyond the intended purpose of student finance, which is to support the student's own educational journey and living costs in the UK.

The friend's argument has merit: taxpayer money (including from her parents) is being diverted from its intended purpose. While the author will eventually repay the loans, they're currently using funds meant for their education to support someone else's living expenses abroad.

The comparison to spending on nights out isn't entirely equivalent - while that spending might be questioned as non-essential, it's still the student spending on their own activities in the UK. Sending money abroad to support another person's rent is fundamentally different from the intended use of these funds.

The sister appears to be inconsistent with discipline (""gives in to his tantrums""), which can reinforce problematic behaviors and undermine the author's efforts to maintain structure.

However, the author's language and attitude toward the child is deeply concerning. Calling an 8-year-old a ""whiniest little shit,"" saying he ""sucks at life,"" and expressing hatred toward a child who is clearly struggling shows a lack of empathy and understanding of child development.

The author is dealing with unresolved trauma from losing their brother to cancer at age 13, which is a devastating experience that can leave lasting psychological wounds.

Your boyfriend's feelings of hurt are understandable - discovering something like this unexpectedly, especially when he initially misidentified it, likely felt embarrassing and created insecurity about why you hadn't mentioned it. His feelings about feeling ""inferior"" or left out of this aspect of your intimate life are valid emotional responses.

However, you're not obligated to disclose every personal item you purchase, including intimate ones. Many people consider their solo intimate practices private, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. Your surprise at his reaction suggests this wasn't intentionally secretive or meant to hurt him.

The key issue seems to be a mismatch in expectations about sharing intimate details in your relationship. Neither of you is fundamentally wrong - you just had different assumptions about what should be shared.

The fact that you feel bad about hurting him and are reflecting on this shows you care about his feelings. This seems like a communication issue that you both can work through by discussing boundaries and expectations going forward.

You were faced with a recurring awkward situation where accepting compliments on your English led to increasingly uncomfortable follow-up questions and assumptions that put you in the position of either lying or having to explain anyway. When you finally chose to politely clarify the truth upfront (""Oh, English is my first language, I was born and raised in America"" with a laugh), you were simply being honest about your background.

Your response was:
- Truthful and factual
- Delivered with a laugh (suggesting friendly tone)
- Not insulting or dismissive of the person
- A reasonable way to prevent the awkward spiral of follow-up questions you'd experienced before

The people complimenting your English are making understandable assumptions based on appearance, but those assumptions happen to be incorrect. Your friend calling you ""rude"" seems to misunderstand that you were simply clarifying a misconception politely rather than being dismissive or mean-spirited.

James's problematic behavior:
- Displayed wealth ostentatiously on dating profiles, which could attract people with financial motives
- Treated what appears to be a sexual relationship casually while the other person may have had different expectations
- Continued seeing other women without clear communication about exclusivity
- Is now pressuring Emma to have an abortion primarily for his own financial/inheritance concerns

Emma's concerning behavior:
- Appears to have been attracted to and actively showcased James's wealth on social media
- May be considering keeping the pregnancy partly due to his wealthy background (though this is speculation from James's perspective)

However, the core issue is that both consenting adults engaged in sexual activity despite using protection, and an unintended pregnancy occurred. While James has legitimate concerns about his future and the timing, and Emma may have mixed motives, the fundamental right to make reproductive choices belongs to the pregnant person. James's pressure for abortion based primarily on protecting his inheritance, combined with his cavalier approach to the relationship, shows poor judgment and responsibility.

Emma's potential financial motivations are concerning, but ultimately she has the right to make her own reproductive decisions regardless of the circumstances that led to the pregnancy.

Both parties contributed to this situation through poor communication and potentially questionable motives, but James's behavior in handling the aftermath is more problematic.

You even checked in with her before acting on it, giving her a day to reconsider, which shows you were trying to honor the spirit of your agreement.

The author asked their neighbor to turn down music that was extremely loud - described as sounding like ""it might as well have been in my apartment."" This level of noise, regardless of the time, represents excessive volume that would reasonably disturb neighbors. The fact that the neighbor immediately turned off the music both times suggests they were aware it was too loud.

While people have the right to enjoy music in their homes, this right has reasonable limits when living in shared housing. Excessively loud music that can be clearly heard in adjacent units, even outside quiet hours, crosses the line of reasonable enjoyment into disturbing others.

The author's approach was direct but not unreasonable - they went to speak with the neighbor face-to-face rather than immediately involving management or authorities. The phrasing ""I hate it"" was perhaps a bit blunt, but the core request to turn down genuinely disruptive noise was legitimate.

The neighbor's extreme response of leaving for two days suggests they may have overreacted to a reasonable request, though their immediate compliance shows they understood the music was too loud.

The author's behavior is problematic in several ways:
1. Deliberately ignored a reasonable request from the tenant about keeping the cat out of certain rooms

The tenant's only questionable action was not explaining why the cat shouldn't enter the bedrooms, but tenants have reasonable expectations of privacy and aren't obligated to justify every household rule to their landlord.

Background story-

Currently...",Other,Nobody,0.8,0.7777777777777778,True,"Looking at this situation, I can see a young adult who is contributing significantly to the household while still living under his parents' roof, creating a complex dynamic about independence and house rules.

The author is clearly doing a lot - working 25-30 hours while in school full-time, paying for his own car expenses, doing major home improvement projects with his own money, and helping with emergency repairs during midterm week. These are substantial contributions that go well beyond typical expectations for a 20-year-old living at home.

However, the core issue here is that he's living in his parents' home while they pay for his education. This creates a natural tension between his desire for adult independence and their parental authority in their own house. His requests (staying overnight at girlfriend's place, not being questioned about money, making plans without asking) are reasonable desires for a 20-year-old, but his parents - particularly his mother - clearly have different comfort levels with these freedoms.

The mother's behavior of bringing up the unfinished flooring project (which was delayed because she created a bathroom emergency during his midterms) seems unfair and manipulative. However, parents setting house rules, even restrictive ones, isn't inherently wrong when supporting an adult child.

My aunt has done ...",Other,Everybody,0.8,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I can see valid concerns on multiple sides, but there are some key issues with how this was handled.

The author has a reasonable point about not wanting to constantly kennel their dog in their own home. However, they seem to have taken a somewhat inflexible stance without attempting to find middle ground or help address the underlying issue (the 4-year-old's fear of dogs).

The sister's behavior - screaming, cursing, and causing public scenes - is clearly inappropriate and counterproductive. This kind of reaction, especially in front of the child, is problematic.

However, the family as a whole (including the author) appears to have enabled this situation for years without addressing the root cause: helping a 4-year-old overcome her fear of dogs through gradual, positive exposure. Instead, everyone has just accommodated the fear, which has likely made it worse.

The author's approach of hoping to ignore the child's distress and expecting her to ""shut up about it"" shows a lack of understanding of child development and empathy for a genuinely frightened 4-year-old.

While the sister's reaction was extreme and inappropriate, the author also escalated by deliberately taking the dog back out after their fiancé had tried to compromise, knowing this would cause conflict.

This seems like a situation where everyone bears some responsibility for poor communication and handling of a long-standing family issue.

The author was factually correct - engineering is indeed a highly regulated field that typically requires formal education and licensing for safety reasons (as they confirmed by googling the legal requirements in their area). Their concern about their friend's unrealistic career expectations was legitimate.

However, the way the author expressed this concern was problematic. The phrase ""just because you believe the world is one way, doesn't mean it is"" comes across as condescending and dismissive, especially in a group setting. This phrasing was unnecessarily harsh and likely embarrassing for their friend.

The friend (L) also bears some responsibility here. According to the author's edits, L had a ""holier than thou"" attitude, claiming they could be ""way better than any of us without going to university because they're so smart and bright."" This kind of arrogant dismissal of others' educational choices would understandably be frustrating to hear.

Both parties handled this poorly - the friend was being arrogant and unrealistic, while the author was tactless in their response.

- She went through the author's personal belongings without permission
- She threw away half of his belongings without his knowledge or consent

The author's situation is different:
- He had forgotten about a tucked-away shoebox from an ex

- He didn't violate her privacy or destroy her belongings

While both had kept mementos from past relationships, the key differences are: the girlfriend's actions were deliberate and retaliatory (putting up photos after a fight), invasive (going through his things), and destructive (throwing away his belongings). The author's shoebox was forgotten and hidden away, not displayed.

The friend made an initial social misstep by touching someone without permission, even if it was just a shoulder tap to get attention. While his intention was innocent (asking about a drink), touching strangers without consent can make people uncomfortable, and the woman had every right to express that boundary.

However, the woman's reaction was extremely disproportionate - screaming, calling him a ""pig,"" claiming it was ""rape,"" and continuing to escalate the situation. These are serious accusations that don't match the severity of a shoulder tap.

The author, while trying to defend their friend, continued to argue with staff and other patrons even after being asked to leave multiple times. This prolonged the conflict and made everyone more uncomfortable. The bartender's job is to maintain a safe environment, and when they asked the author to leave, continuing to argue was inappropriate.

The bartender also handled this poorly by becoming hostile, using profanity, and threatening to dump drinks rather than professionally de-escalating the situation.

Everyone contributed to turning a minor social interaction into a major confrontation.

The author acknowledges that his wife is a light sleeper who has had to stop using earplugs due to their young children (ages 2 and 4).

Sleep disruption is particularly problematic for parents of young children who are already dealing with interrupted sleep.

While the author has a legitimate desire for personal time and recreational activities, the way he's pursuing this is directly impacting his partner's well-being and sleep quality. The fact that he ""often"" falls asleep on the couch suggests this isn't an occasional accident but a predictable pattern he continues despite knowing the consequences.

- She escalated a playful moment into something more aggressive by involving friends (""Friend Name, cupcake me!"")
- She showed no empathy when the author was clearly upset
- She refused to apologize or acknowledge his feelings
- She dismissed his emotions as ""childish"" and told him to ""grow up""

The author experienced trauma triggers from their past manipulative relationship, which caused an involuntary emotional response. However, telling their current boyfriend ""you remind me of my ex"" after he gave a genuine compliment was hurtful and unfair to him. While the trauma response is understandable, the author is responsible for managing their triggers and communicating them appropriately rather than lashing out.

The boyfriend's reaction, while understandably hurt, was also problematic. Dismissing trauma with ""get over your ex"" and minimizing the impact based on relationship duration shows a lack of empathy and understanding about how emotional abuse affects people long-term.

Both parties handled this poorly - the author by projecting past trauma onto innocent behavior, and the boyfriend by being dismissive of trauma responses. However, this appears to stem from poor communication and emotional management rather than malicious intent from either side.

This situation calls for mutual understanding, better communication about triggers and boundaries, and possibly professional support for processing past trauma.

As a cashier handling Western Union transactions, you have both the right and responsibility to deny suspicious transactions. The details you gathered raise legitimate red flags:
- Large sum ($6000) to someone described only as ""a friend""
- International connection (Hong Kong)
- Vague purpose (""for bags"") that you and your manager reasonably suspected could involve counterfeit goods
- Potential legal and employment consequences if the transaction facilitated illegal activity

Your questioning process appears standard and professional. You consulted with your manager, who agreed with your assessment. The company policy explicitly allows you to deny transactions at your discretion, precisely for situations like this.

While your father's perspective about not judging people has merit in general social situations, this was a professional decision involving potential legal liability. Western Union agents are expected to identify and prevent suspicious transactions - it's part of the job, not personal judgment.

The ex-boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic - using slurs, being primarily interested in sex, stealing, and creating a situation where you feel unsafe. His actions during and after the relationship were inappropriate and hurtful.

However, your plan to report him appears to be motivated primarily by revenge rather than genuine concern for justice or public safety. You explicitly state you want to ""see what it'll do"" and are considering reporting relatively minor offenses that you were previously okay with (you knew about the drug use while dating). The timing - doing this after a bad breakup rather than when the incidents occurred - suggests retaliation.

While his behavior was worse, using the legal system as a tool for personal revenge rather than for legitimate law enforcement purposes is also problematic. If you genuinely believed these were serious crimes that needed reporting, that would be different, but your stated motivation makes this ethically questionable.

Your safety concerns are valid and should be taken seriously, but reporting minor past offenses may actually escalate the situation rather than improve your safety.

The core issue is that you brought a dog into the shared house without giving your roommates advance notice, even though this was supposed to be a short visit that unexpectedly extended overnight. While your roommate A's reaction was harsh and poorly timed, his underlying concern about being informed when pets are brought into his home is reasonable.

However, A also bears responsibility for:
- Not communicating his concerns during the day when he could have addressed it calmly
- Waiting until the guests left to confront you in what you describe as a threatening manner
- The aggressive tone and approach to what should have been a simple house rule discussion

You and your partner could have handled this better by giving all roommates a heads up about the dog visit, even if it was initially planned to be brief. When plans changed and the dog stayed overnight, that definitely warranted communication.

Both sides failed to communicate effectively - you didn't inform roommates about the pet guest, and A didn't express his concerns constructively or in a timely manner.

Will has received three speeding tickets in less than a year, including going 63 in a 35 mph zone and 82 in a 55 mph zone. These are significant speed violations - going 28 mph over and 27 mph over the limit respectively. He also doesn't seem to take full responsibility, suggesting the tickets ""weren't his fault"" due to circumstances like speed traps or passing situations.

However, the author is now criticizing Will for being overly cautious after getting these tickets, telling him to speed up when he's driving at or near the speed limit, and suggesting he should continue speeding 5-10 mph over. She's also pressuring him to drive faster in situations where ""we're going to be late"" - often because he's running late getting ready.

While Will's excessive speeding that led to the tickets was clearly problematic, the author is now pushing him away from legal, safe driving practices. She's essentially encouraging him to continue breaking traffic laws, just ""less"" than before. Her frustration seems partly driven by convenience (not wanting to be late) rather than genuine safety concerns.

The author was dealing with:
- Discovering their true sexual identity as a teenager
- Fear of harassment and persecution at a religious school
- Genuine care for their girlfriend's wellbeing
- A difficult breakup situation with no perfect options

The girlfriend's reaction (blocking, blowing up) is understandable given she was hurt and confused by what seemed like a sudden loss of feelings.

The author chose to lie about the reason for the breakup to protect themselves from potential harassment. While this caused additional pain to the girlfriend, the author was a minor in a potentially hostile environment making a difficult decision about their safety and privacy.

The core issue isn't really about fault - it's about a teenager trying to navigate an incredibly difficult situation involving identity, safety, and relationships. The author showed care by ending the relationship rather than continuing it dishonestly, even though the method wasn't ideal.

- Turned a private business decision into a public shaming campaign

The author's explanation, while perhaps not perfectly worded, was reasonable and honest. They explained legitimate business concerns about making children's clothing (quick growth, single-use items, potential for damage). The wedding gown analogy showed this wasn't specifically about children but about certain types of projects.

The friend's response was completely disproportionate. Taking a private conversation to social media to encourage attacks on someone's business and appearance crosses clear boundaries of acceptable behavior. This goes far beyond being hurt by the explanation - it's deliberate retaliation designed to harm the author.

The author stole his girlfriend's phone and destroyed it by throwing it in a river. While his stated motivation was to help her overcome what he perceives as phone addiction and academic underperformance, this action crosses several serious boundaries:

1. **Theft and destruction of property** - Taking someone's phone without permission and destroying it is both theft and vandalism, regardless of intent.

2. **Violation of autonomy** - The girlfriend is capable of making her own decisions about her life, studies, and phone usage. The author imposed his will on her without her consent.

3. **Controlling behavior** - This represents a concerning pattern of trying to control another person's behavior through extreme measures.

4. **Safety concerns** - Phones are important safety devices, especially for students at boarding school.

The author's past success with similar restrictions doesn't justify imposing them on someone else. What worked for him was a voluntary choice he made for himself with a friend's help. His girlfriend never consented to this intervention.

While the author may have had good intentions and genuinely cares about his girlfriend's potential, the method he chose was completely inappropriate and harmful. Her panicked reaction is entirely understandable - someone she trusted violated that trust and destroyed her property.

The author had a legitimate grievance - paying for a full day of skiing but only receiving 3 hours due to weather conditions. Seeking some form of compensation or refund for significantly reduced service is reasonable consumer behavior.

However, the author's approach became problematic. While initially reasonable in asking for a partial refund, they escalated to ""full attack mode"" and engaged in a 45-minute confrontational argument, followed by another 30 minutes with the manager. This level of aggressive persistence, especially as a tourist in Japan where such behavior goes against cultural norms, was excessive and inappropriate.

The resort staff (cashier and manager) handled the situation reasonably given the circumstances, and the author did show good character by later apologizing to the cashier.

The fact that weather-related closures might be mentioned in terms and conditions doesn't excuse the poor customer service, and the author's core complaint was valid. However, the aggressive approach was disproportionate to the situation.

Your need for clarity and structure in communication is valid, and it's clear you care deeply about your friends.

However, I think you need to recognize that when people are struggling with mental health issues, they often genuinely cannot provide the concrete timelines you're seeking. Your friend's inability to give you a specific timeframe isn't inconsiderate - it's likely an honest reflection of not knowing how long their healing process will take. Mental health recovery is unpredictable.

While your anxiety about uncertainty is understandable, expecting people in crisis to manage your emotional needs alongside their own struggles places an unfair burden on them. Your previous reaction of having a ""mental breakdown"" and cutting off your ex-friend was disproportionate to the situation.

The pattern here suggests you may benefit from developing better coping strategies for uncertainty and finding additional support systems so you're not so dependent on any one person's availability.

What you should do: Consider therapy to work on managing your anxiety around uncertainty and abandonment. Develop multiple friendships so you're not overly dependent on one person.

The author has legitimate concerns about work-life balance, unpaid overtime, and wanting their partner present for guests.

The author clearly has established insecurity about playing drums for others and has only played for her boyfriend ""a handful of times"" despite his requests. This insecurity was well-known to the boyfriend. When she made the video as a personal birthday gift, there's a reasonable expectation that personal gifts remain private unless explicitly stated otherwise.

The boyfriend's initial reaction was understandable - he was excited and proud. However, his key mistake was posting the video publicly without asking permission first, especially knowing about her insecurity. While he may not have had explicit instructions not to post it, posting someone else's content (especially something personal like a performance) without permission violates basic social media etiquette and respect for the creator.

More problematically, after initially agreeing to take it down when he saw how distressed she was, he then sent a defensive text calling her ""ridiculous"" and enlisted a mutual friend to validate his position. This shows a lack of empathy and an unwillingness to acknowledge that he made an error in judgment.

The author's reaction - panic and distress - was proportionate to someone with known performance anxiety having their private gift shared publicly without consent. While she could have been more explicit about not sharing it, it's reasonable to expect that personal gifts remain private unless otherwise specified.

The boyfriend is primarily at fault for posting without permission and then doubling down with defensiveness rather than showing understanding for his girlfriend's feelings.

While your work stress is understandable and legitimate, the core issue is that you failed to communicate when you had the opportunity.

This silence likely led her and her mother to assume you were interested and proceed with purchasing an expensive ticket on your behalf.

Canceling on the day of the event - especially for something that was a generous Christmas gift - is quite problematic. The timing suggests the ticket will likely go unused, wasting the mother's money and gesture of goodwill. Your roommate's frustration is justified, as she's now in an awkward position with her mother who spent money on someone who won't attend.

That said, your roommate's response of trying to shame you and making vague threats about ""talking about it later"" isn't the most mature way to handle the situation, even if her underlying frustration is warranted.

The sister's speech, while perhaps not ideally crafted, appears to have been well-intentioned. She was trying to honor the groom by sharing how his kindness during her difficult time revealed his character - which is actually a common and appropriate theme for wedding speeches. Mental health struggles are part of many people's lives, and acknowledging support received isn't inherently inappropriate.

However, the author's reaction was disproportionately harsh. Asking the maid of honor - her own sister - to leave the wedding reception because guests complimented her speech crosses a significant line. This was an extreme response to what was at most a poorly structured speech. The author's focus on not getting enough attention (""Nobody was paying attention to me"") suggests the reaction was driven more by jealousy than genuine concern about appropriateness.

The fact that the husband (who was being honored in the speech) and close friends all thought the author was ""way too harsh"" provides important perspective from people who witnessed the events firsthand.

While the sister could have crafted her speech better to focus more on the couple, her intentions were good and her content wasn't truly inappropriate.

The author's initial comment about not introducing her boyfriend until he has a job, even if meant jokingly, was hurtful and dismissive of his worth as a person. While she may understand her parents' traditional values, the way she communicated this created the impression that she views him through the same lens - as inadequate due to his temporary unemployment.

The boyfriend's feelings of being deemed ""not good enough"" are understandable given this context. His concerns about her being ashamed of him appear to stem from a pattern of behavior, not just this one incident, as evidenced by his feelings about her Asian friends as well.

However, the author does show genuine care for both her boyfriend and her parents, and cultural considerations are real factors that deserve acknowledgment. Her desire to manage family dynamics isn't inherently wrong, but her approach lacked sensitivity and clear communication about her true intentions.

The boyfriend could have responded more constructively to the initial comment, but his hurt reaction seems proportionate to feeling reduced to his employment status by someone he loves.

She's willing to negotiate and find solutions that work for both of them. Meanwhile, the author admits he's being stubborn and unwilling to compromise ""at all"" - it's either his way or nothing.

The author's reasoning is based on tradition and his childhood assumption that his kids would have his last name.

His position essentially dismisses her family heritage entirely while demanding his be preserved completely.

Kids aged 2-5 cry frequently - it's how they communicate distress, frustration, tiredness, or other needs they can't yet articulate properly. The parents aren't necessarily doing anything wrong by not ""stifling"" the crying, as many parenting approaches actually discourage immediately stopping all crying, and some crying simply can't be prevented regardless of parenting quality.

However, your response of yelling through the walls, even if meant as ""joking,"" is inappropriate and likely making the situation worse. The family can probably hear your comments, which could be distressing to both the children and parents. This behavior could escalate tensions and doesn't actually solve the noise issue.

That said, you do have a reasonable expectation of some peace in your home, and constant loud crying can genuinely be disruptive to sleep and daily life.

The core issue here is a lack of communication. Instead of yelling through walls, a mature approach would be to have a respectful conversation with your neighbors about the situation. They may not even realize how much the sound carries, and there might be solutions that work for everyone.

Your behavior is the primary problem here, as you're choosing an antagonistic response rather than addressing this like adults.

The stepchildren's behavior is clearly problematic - stealing, lying, damaging property, and potentially endangering a toddler are serious issues that cannot be excused regardless of their difficult family situation. However, they are teenagers from a broken home dealing with multiple divorces, living with dysfunctional grandparents, and watching their former stepfather start a new family.

The author appears to have made genuine efforts initially to build relationships with the stepchildren, but has now reached a point of wanting them completely cut off from their lives. While understandable given the described behavior, this ultimatum approach regarding her fiancé's relationship with children he helped raise for 7 years shows some inflexibility.

The fiancé seems caught between his emotional attachment to children he once considered his own and protecting his current family. His continued financial support despite having no legal obligation shows care, but his inability to set appropriate boundaries has enabled problematic behavior.

The biological mother and grandparents appear to be failing these children, but we have limited information about their perspective or efforts.

Everyone involved has contributed to this dysfunctional dynamic in some way - the stepchildren through their behavior, the author through her ultimatum approach, the fiancé through poor boundary-setting, and the extended family through apparent neglect.

However, getting ""mad"" at someone for eating food they're sharing, especially when that person is drunk and likely not thinking clearly about the logistics, seems like an overreaction.

The girlfriend was inconsiderate by continuing to eat after being asked to wait, but this appears to be more about impaired judgment from drinking rather than malicious intent. The author could have handled this more patiently given the circumstances.

The author's reaction is understandable - there's a significant difference between sleeping on sheets with nosebleed stains versus period blood from an ex-partner. The boyfriend initially lied about the source of the stains, which created a trust issue. The author's discomfort with sleeping on intimate bodily fluids from a previous relationship is a reasonable boundary.

However, the author's demand that the boyfriend throw away the sheets entirely seems excessive. The boyfriend offered a reasonable compromise by changing the sheets but keeping them (presumably for other uses or after proper cleaning). Demanding their complete disposal goes beyond addressing the immediate comfort issue.

The boyfriend is also problematic - he lied initially about the stains and then dismissed the author's legitimate concerns by calling them jealous rather than acknowledging the difference between the two situations.

Both parties escalated this into an unnecessary argument when compromise was possible. The author could have accepted the sheet change without demanding disposal, and the boyfriend could have been honest from the start and more understanding of the author's discomfort.

However, your feelings about the apparent double standard are understandable - she admits she would be ""furious"" if you hung out with another woman, yet she went out with a male coworker. The fact that her lateness was directly caused by prioritizing staying with this other person (rather than just poor planning) does add a legitimate layer of hurt.

That said, your girlfriend did communicate proactively about time changes and the delay, which shows more consideration than your past pattern of lateness. The situation also seems to have genuinely gotten away from her rather than being intentional disrespect.

- Poor communication (one-word responses, unwillingness to change communication patterns)

The author made a deliberate choice to conceal something significant from someone they share living space with, knowing it would be controversial. While they took safety precautions (keeping it locked up), the decision to hide this information shows they understood it could affect their roommate but chose secrecy over communication.

The roommate's reaction, while understandably emotional given their apparent strong feelings about guns, crossed into inappropriate territory by calling the author names like ""psycho"" and ""gun nut"" to mutual friends, and issuing an ultimatum.

Both parties handled this poorly - the author through concealment of something they knew would be contentious in a shared living situation, and the roommate through name-calling and public disparagement rather than having a mature conversation about boundaries and living arrangements.

However, the core issue stems from the author's initial decision to hide something significant that affects the shared living environment, even if indirectly.

The author is dealing with ADHD and autism, which genuinely affect executive functioning - making it harder to remember tasks, sequence activities, and manage time without medication. Their request for a simple accommodation (using the computer closing as a cue to start getting ready) seems reasonable and shows they're trying to find a solution that works for both of them.

The boyfriend's reaction - shouting, refusing to consider any change, and placing all responsibility on the author - was disproportionate and unhelpful. While he also has ADHD and may struggle with transitions, his unwillingness to even discuss a minor adjustment to help his partner manage a genuine disability-related challenge is problematic. The author wasn't asking him to fundamentally change who he is, just to provide a simple cue.

However, the author could potentially explore other solutions too, like setting phone alarms when the boyfriend says ""10 minutes"" or starting to get ready at a predetermined time regardless of his gaming status.

The author made an inappropriate comment (""oh shit what a Legend"") about someone who was clearly behaving badly toward multiple women. While the author may have been intoxicated and speaking without thinking, celebrating someone's manipulative and hurtful behavior toward others was insensitive and offensive, especially when said within earshot of someone who was hurt by similar behavior.

However, the woman's response of throwing her cocktail at the author was a physical escalation that crossed a line from verbal offense to assault. Regardless of how offensive the comment was, throwing a drink at someone is not an appropriate response.

The gay friend's verbal reaction (swearing and calling the author names) was more proportionate to the offensive comment, though still escalatory.

The bartender asking the author to leave seems reasonable given the disruption and the fact that the author made the offensive comment that started the conflict.

Both the author and the woman acted inappropriately - the author with an insensitive comment that celebrated harmful behavior, and the woman with physical retaliation. The author's comment was the catalyst, but throwing a drink escalated it to a physical confrontation.

While the author had a legitimate concern about being able to study effectively, the way they handled it was problematic.

The author was dealing with a real issue - strong body odor that was interfering with their ability to concentrate in a shared study space. However, directly confronting someone about their body odor in a public setting is generally considered socially inappropriate and potentially humiliating for the other person. There were better alternatives available, such as:

- Moving to a different seat
- Speaking to library staff privately
- Taking a break and returning later
- Using a private study room

The offer to provide deodorant, while potentially well-intentioned, likely made the situation more embarrassing for the other person. The fact that other people in the study room reacted negatively suggests the approach was indeed inappropriate.

The author admits to deliberately not allowing cars to merge in front of them as a general practice, driven by territorial feelings and a sense that others don't ""deserve"" to merge ahead. While they make exceptions for safety situations like highway on-ramps, their default approach is to block merging attempts.

However, they're also describing genuinely problematic behavior from other drivers - people who intentionally use lanes they know don't go where they need to go, just to cut to the front of queues at intersections. This type of aggressive lane-cutting does create traffic problems and is inconsiderate.

The issue is that the author has adopted a blanket policy of blocking merges rather than distinguishing between legitimate merging needs and actual line-cutting. Not all merge attempts are from people trying to cheat the system - some are from drivers who genuinely need to change lanes due to navigation needs, unexpected obstacles, or other legitimate reasons.

Road safety and traffic flow work best when drivers are generally cooperative while still being appropriately assertive against truly problematic behavior. A blanket ""no merging"" policy can create dangerous situations and road rage incidents.

The key issue here is consent and respect for boundaries. While the boyfriend is under stress and is providing significant support, this does not give him the right to:
1. Repeatedly ask for sex after being told to ask only once
2. Physically attempt to initiate sex after being told ""not really"" when asked if she was feeling up to it

The author has been clear about her medical condition, her limitations, and her boundaries. She even offered compromise (cuddling, watching TV) and has been understanding of his stress. The boyfriend's behavior of trying to pull down her pants after she said she wasn't feeling up to sex crosses a clear line of consent.

The aunt has been consistently:
- Tagging the author in offensive memes that dismiss their mental health conditions
- Making public posts that essentially shame the author for their identity, mental health, and interests
- Posting religious content targeting the author's sexual orientation
- Making a public post offering to ""fix"" the author while implying they need to become ""a good person again""

This represents months or years of targeted harassment, often done publicly on social media where others can see it. The aunt was using her platform to repeatedly attack someone who was trying to ignore the behavior.

When the author finally responded, they did so privately via text message (not publicly like the aunt had been doing) and avoided profanity or personal attacks, instead focusing on pointing out the aunt's hypocritical behavior and the harm it was causing.

While the author's response was lengthy and direct, it appears to be a proportionate reaction to sustained harassment. The fact that the entire family immediately sided with the aunt and blocked the author suggests this family has a pattern of not supporting the author, which validates their concerns about the family dynamics.

The aunt initiated and sustained this conflict through repeated public harassment of someone with diagnosed mental health conditions. The author's response, while firm, was a defensive reaction to prolonged mistreatment.

The friend is living in her own rented space and has a right to dress comfortably in her home. However, the living arrangement creates an unusual dynamic where she must pass through your bedroom to access her room, making this a shared transitional space rather than purely private areas.

Your physical response is natural and involuntary - you can't control that. However, your expectation that she should change her clothing choices because of your reaction is problematic. The appropriate response would be to manage your own reactions and perhaps discuss practical solutions (like knocking before she passes through, or exploring alternative room arrangements).

The comparison to ""getting in trouble if I was barely dressed"" suggests a misunderstanding - the issue isn't gender-based double standards, but rather that you're asking someone to modify their comfort in their own living space to manage your feelings.

Your wife and her friend may be dismissive because they see this as your issue to manage rather than the friend's responsibility to accommodate.

This policy exists for legitimate security reasons - to prevent coupon fraud and misuse. You also correctly explained the inventory accountability issues and register reconciliation concerns that would arise from giving away merchandise without proper payment or documentation.

The customer's frustration is understandable - forgetting a rewards card for a small purchase is annoying. However, her reaction was disproportionate and inappropriate.

Their preference for alternative activities like a beach walk shows they want to spend quality time together, just not at prom.

However, the girlfriend clearly values attending prom despite the previous disappointing experience. This suggests it holds personal significance for her beyond just the event itself - perhaps it represents a milestone, closure to her high school experience, or something she's looked forward to.

The core issue isn't really about who's ""right"" about prom being overpriced or poorly organized. It's about two people having different values and priorities around this event, and needing to find a way to navigate that difference respectfully.

The girlfriend's abrupt shutdown with attitude (""I'm not going to cum, I'm going to bed goodnight"") was dismissive and didn't consider her partner's feelings or the situation they were both in. However, the author's response was more problematic - pressuring someone to continue sexual activity after they've indicated they want to stop crosses an important boundary. His comment about ""teasing"" and getting upset about her stopping was inappropriate, regardless of how frustrated he felt.

The girlfriend then offered ""pity sex,"" which created an uncomfortable dynamic, and the author was right to decline that. However, his overall reaction to her initial boundary-setting was the more serious issue here.

While both contributed to the conflict through poor communication and consideration for each other, the author's response to his partner wanting to stop sexual activity was the primary problem.

The author clearly stated they paid the $200 ""with no expectations that she would pay me back. It was a straight up gift on my part."" This was a deliberate, conscious decision made at the time. The SIL's subsequent inheritance doesn't retroactively change the nature of that original transaction.

While I understand the temptation - $30k is a significant windfall and the author was generous in helping with veterinary care - asking for the money back would essentially be trying to convert a gift into a loan after the fact. This could damage the relationship and comes across as opportunistic, especially since the author admits they ""would never expect her to pay me back normally.""

The SIL's poor pet ownership and the cat's attachment to the author's household are separate issues from this financial question. The author made a compassionate choice to help an animal in need, and that good deed shouldn't be contingent on the recipient's future financial status.

The ethical thing to do is to honor the original intent of the gift and not ask for repayment, regardless of the inheritance.

We don't really ...",Author,Everybody,0.85,0.8085106382978723,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the boundaries and respect involved in committed relationships.

The author made a pact with someone to hook up if either becomes single in the future. While technically this doesn't involve physical cheating, it does cross emotional and commitment boundaries in several ways:

1. It demonstrates a lack of full commitment to the current relationship by actively planning for its potential end
2. It maintains an inappropriate emotional/sexual connection with someone outside the relationship
3. It would likely hurt and feel like a betrayal to the girlfriend if she knew about it
4. The author acknowledges both parties ""meant what we said"" - showing genuine intent behind the pact

The author seems genuinely confused about whether this was wrong, suggesting some naivety rather than malicious intent. However, being in their first relationship doesn't excuse crossing relationship boundaries, especially when their friend clearly pointed out the problematic nature of the behavior.

The other person (C) is equally at fault for participating in this pact while also being in a relationship. Both parties made the same choice to prioritize a future sexual opportunity over respect for their current partners.

This appears to be a case where both people made the same boundary-crossing decision together.

You've offered practical advice (making a pros and cons list), shown patience by listening repeatedly, and even offered to help him create the list together.

Your boyfriend seems stuck in an unproductive cycle of rumination without taking steps to organize his thoughts or move forward. While this behavior is likely driven by anxiety rather than malice, it's creating a pattern where he's using you as a sounding board without implementing the tools that could actually help him.

Your boundary-setting (""stop talking to me about it if you're not going to follow my advice"") is reasonable. You're not refusing to support him entirely - you're asking him to engage constructively with the help you're offering rather than continuing an endless loop that isn't serving either of you.

However, your delivery and timing could potentially be more compassionate, given that he's clearly struggling with what seems to be decision paralysis or anxiety.

She was very nice, very sweet (Italian) and she was always friendly...",Everybody,Everybody,0.8,0.375,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the actions and reactions of both parties involved.

The author clearly made a significant error in judgment by:
- Impersonating a faculty member via email
- Using university systems inappropriately 
- Creating a prank that could reasonably cause distress given the context (Ani's existing stress about her supervisor and dissertation)
- Not immediately confessing when the prank didn't go as planned

However, Ani's response seems disproportionate:
- She escalated a prank between friends directly to formal disciplinary proceedings
- She involved ""the ENTIRE department"" rather than first trying to resolve it personally
- She threatened expulsion and refused any contact, ending a long friendship over what was clearly intended as a harmless joke
- She didn't give the author any opportunity to explain or apologize before involving authorities

The author's prank was poorly thought out and inappropriate, but it was clearly not malicious - they were close friends, it was intended as a lighthearted joke with immediate revelation, and when technical issues prevented that, the author simply forgot about it. The department head's resolution confirms this wasn't harassment or part of a pattern.

Ani's reaction, while understandable given her stress, was excessive for the situation. A conversation between friends should have preceded formal disciplinary action, especially given their close relationship and the author's clear lack of malicious intent.

Both parties bear some responsibility - the author for the inappropriate prank, and Ani for the disproportionate escalation - but Ani's response was more unreasonable given the context and relationship.

The waiter provided subpar service - being rude, not providing basic service like water without being asked, and failing to bring standard condiments. A tip is traditionally meant to reflect service quality, so adjusting the tip based on poor service is reasonable.

However, a $2 tip on a $40 meal (5%) is quite low even for poor service. While the author had valid reasons for reducing the tip, this amount could be seen as insulting rather than constructive feedback.

The waiter's reaction was highly unprofessional. Confronting a customer about their tip amount and calling them names crosses clear professional boundaries, regardless of disappointment with the tip.

The author's decision to explain their reasoning shows they weren't trying to be malicious, but rather communicate why they felt the service didn't warrant a standard tip.

Both parties could have handled this better - the author could have tipped slightly more (perhaps 8-10%) to better match the ""poor but not terrible"" service level, and the waiter should never have confronted the customer or made personal attacks.

Since both the inadequate service and the unprofessional confrontation contributed to this conflict, with valid criticisms of both parties' actions.

You're being generous by cooking breakfast for your roommate every morning, which is genuinely kind. However, once you discovered he doesn't like parsley (evidenced by him hiding it under his cup), your plan to add even MORE parsley tomorrow crosses a line. This shifts from being considerate to being deliberately antagonistic.

Your roommate is also handling this poorly - instead of politely mentioning he doesn't care for parsley, he's hiding it and not communicating. However, his approach, while awkward, seems to come from not wanting to seem ungrateful for the free meals you're providing.

The core issue is that you're both avoiding direct communication about food preferences, but your planned response of adding more of something he clearly dislikes is more problematic than his passive avoidance.

A simple ""Hey, I noticed you're not eating the parsley - would you prefer I leave it off?"" would solve this easily.

Getting visibly upset about a minor change to plans that may not even significantly affect you shows a lack of flexibility and consideration for your parents, who are hosting friends.

His behavior constitutes sexual harassment - he's ignored your rejections, escalated his behavior, and violated your personal boundaries.

You are not at fault here. While lying about being a lesbian wasn't ideal, it was an understandable panic response to an uncomfortable situation created by his inappropriate behavior. You shouldn't have to lie about your sexuality to get someone to respect your boundaries, but given the circumstances, this was a minor misstep compared to his serious misconduct.

You have every right to be firmer in your rejections. In fact, being ""colder"" or more direct is often necessary when someone refuses to respect polite boundaries. You're dealing with someone who has shown he doesn't understand or respect subtle social cues, so clearer communication is warranted.

The attempted kiss without consent was a serious escalation that crossed a clear line. You handled it appropriately by pulling away and saying no firmly.

The girlfriend is clearly dealing with significant anxiety around pregnancy due to her conservative upbringing, which is understandable. Her concerns, while perhaps excessive given the precautions being taken, are valid expressions of her comfort level and boundaries.

However, the author's approach and attitude are problematic. He expresses frustration about their sexual frequency, dismisses her legitimate anxieties, and seems to view her concerns as unreasonable obstacles to his sexual satisfaction. His plan to ""distance himself"" from that aspect of the relationship while hoping she'll ""sexually blossom"" suggests he's not fully accepting her current boundaries and is waiting for her to change rather than addressing the fundamental incompatibility.

The author also shows concerning attitudes - getting frustrated when she experiences pain during sex, dismissing her pregnancy anxieties as irrational, and framing the situation primarily around his sexual needs rather than working together to address her legitimate concerns.

While the girlfriend's parents' conservative influence creates pressure, and there are communication issues on both sides, the author's inability to respectfully navigate his partner's boundaries and his dismissive attitude toward her concerns make him primarily at fault for the relationship tension.

Despite this we realized w...,Author,Author,0.8,0.6666666666666666,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives and reasonableness of both parties.

The author's position has some merit - wanting time with established friend groups is normal and healthy in relationships. The comparison to her boyfriend's game convention (which she didn't ask to attend) shows she understands the concept of separate activities. However, her reasoning becomes problematic when she emphasizes that these are ""her friends"" and she wants to be ""alone with them,"" which does sound exclusionary or ""cliquey"" as her boyfriend pointed out.

The boyfriend's concerns are quite reasonable. He's expressing that he feels excluded and uncomfortable with his girlfriend going on a trip that includes her ex while actively preventing him from joining. His desire to ""share an activity"" and be included isn't unreasonable, especially given that other couples will be present. His feelings about being less welcome than the ex-boyfriend are understandable.

The key issue is that the author seems to be prioritizing her ex's comfort and her desire for exclusivity over her current boyfriend's legitimate concerns about boundaries and inclusion. While maintaining friendships with exes can work, it requires extra sensitivity to current partners' feelings.

The author appears to be handling this insensitively by dismissing her boyfriend's concerns and being inflexible about finding a compromise.

The author has legitimate reasons for declining:

- Would need to use saved PTO and lose work income
- House is not child-safe and cannot be made so in 2 days
- Has scheduled work appointments that cannot be cancelled
- Cannot relocate entire work setup
- Openly acknowledges disliking children and being unsuitable as a caregiver

The brother and sister-in-law's request is unreasonable given:
- The extremely short notice

- Demanding the author dispose of legal possessions and completely restructure their living/work situation
- Their hostile reaction when declined

However, the brother and sister-in-law's response was inappropriate - yelling for an hour, name-calling, and public social media shaming goes beyond reasonable disappointment.

While the author's language about children is harsh (""crotch goblins,"" expressing hatred), they were honest about their limitations and the situation's impossibility. The core issue isn't the author's attitude toward children, but rather that this was an unreasonable last-minute request that would require enormous sacrifices.

The brother and sister-in-law are primarily at fault for making an unrealistic demand with inadequate notice and then responding abusively when declined.

When you're accessing your friend's building or your school and there's genuinely no reasonable alternative route, you have a legitimate right to pass through. The entertainment industry doesn't have the authority to completely block essential access, especially without clear signage or advance notice to residents/students.

However, when production assistants specifically ask you to wait or go around and there IS a viable alternative (even if less convenient), ignoring them entirely could be problematic - though understandable when you're running late.

The author describes being attracted to people with mental health issues for two reasons: relatability (sharing similar experiences) and enjoying helping others. The first reason seems genuine and understandable - people often connect with those who share similar struggles. However, the second reason is more concerning, as it suggests seeking out vulnerable people to fulfill a personal need to feel helpful or heroic.

The most problematic aspect is the author's admission of ""sacrificing my mental health and well being to help them improve their mental states"" - this suggests an unhealthy dynamic where they may be overstepping boundaries or creating codependent relationships.

The friend's strong reaction, while harsh in delivery, appears to come from a place of legitimate concern about potentially exploitative behavior. Her points about taking advantage of vulnerable people and having a hero complex have merit, even if expressed harshly.

However, the author seems to have some level of self-awareness about this pattern and is questioning whether it's problematic, which suggests they're not intentionally malicious.

The friend could have handled the conversation more constructively rather than immediately blocking after a ""scathing speech,"" but her core concerns appear valid.

The author describes a clear pattern of escalating abuse over six years:
- Extreme jealousy and controlling behavior (blocking his social media contacts, threatening neighbors)
- Isolation tactics (preventing him from seeing friends, going to work, even getting haircuts)
- Emotional abuse (constant insults, mocking his appearance and emotions)
- Contributing to his development of an eating disorder
- Eventually escalating to physical and sexual violence

The author left when he feared for his safety and is now in recovery. His ex-girlfriend has been diagnosed with BPD and, through manipulation (using a friend's account to contact him), is demanding forgiveness without offering any genuine apology - just expecting him to ""forgive and forget"" and ""get over it.""

The author is being pressured by the ex, her family, and mutual friends who claim he's being ""awful"" for not forgiving her due to her mental health diagnosis.

The author made a significant mistake by having unprotected sex with someone he barely knew, which he clearly acknowledges and regrets. However, his actions afterward show responsibility - he immediately got the morning-after pill, was honest about not wanting a relationship from the start, used protection in subsequent encounters, and handled the breakup directly rather than ghosting. When she revealed the pregnancy/miscarriage, he responded with empathy and took responsibility for his role.

The other person also bears responsibility here. She chose to have unprotected sex as well - this was a mutual decision in the moment, not something forced on her. She was also clear initially about not wanting a relationship. However, her subsequent behavior became problematic - making suicide threats during the breakup, repeatedly contacting him despite his clear boundaries, and now blaming him entirely for a situation they both contributed to.

Both parties made the initial poor decision to have unprotected sex. Both are adults who understood the risks. The pregnancy, while unfortunate, was a known possible consequence that both accepted when they made that choice together.

The author could have been more careful initially, but his post-incident behavior was generally appropriate and responsible. The other person's ongoing harassment and refusal to accept her own agency in the situation shifts more blame toward her.

Looking at this situation, I see parents who were dealing with an unimaginable tragedy - the loss of an infant child - which clearly devastated them and impacted their ability to parent effectively. Their responses (becoming controlling, depressed, dismissive of mental health needs) were harmful to you, but appear to stem from their own unprocessed grief and trauma rather than malicious intent. The inadequate mental health support you received was also influenced by their religious beliefs and the family doctor's poor handling of the situation.

However, you are now an adult dealing with severe mental health consequences, including a suicide attempt, that you directly attribute to these childhood experiences. Your need to protect your mental health and wellbeing is valid and critical. The fact that contact with them triggers depressive episodes and makes you question your safety is extremely serious.

While your parents' actions were harmful and inadequate, they appear to have been struggling with their own devastating loss and doing what they believed was right within their worldview, even if it was deeply flawed. The situation seems to be one where everyone has been hurt and damaged by circumstances, though the impact on you has been severe and ongoing.

The author is being dishonest about his intentions and feelings. He acknowledges that:
1. He doesn't see her as his ""future soulmate"" 
2. He wants to ""pursue other girls"" while keeping her around
3. He's worried he might cheat if he continues the relationship
4. He's essentially using her for companionship and experience while knowing she has much deeper feelings

While he expresses concern about hurting her, his primary motivation seems to be avoiding the discomfort of ending things rather than genuinely caring about her wellbeing. He's considering stringing her along in a relationship where they have fundamentally different expectations and levels of commitment.

The girl appears to be genuine in her feelings and honest about her attachment. She's not doing anything wrong by having strong feelings or expressing them.

The author is being selfish by wanting to keep the benefits of the relationship (companionship, intimacy, her affection) while planning to pursue others and knowing he can't reciprocate her feelings. This is unfair to her and prevents her from finding someone who can match her level of commitment.

The most ethical thing would be to end the relationship now, despite the short-term pain, rather than prolonging a situation built on dishonesty and mismatched expectations.

The author's girlfriend is maintaining close contact with ex-hookups, flirting with them, and has moved one in as a roommate. While she claims these are just ""friends"" and reassures him of her commitment, her actions (flirting, maintaining active contact with former sexual partners) would reasonably cause concern in most romantic relationships. Having an ex-hookup move in as a roommate crosses typical relationship boundaries for many people.

However, the author is simply expressing concern about behaviors that would be problematic for most people in committed relationships. Being worried about a partner flirting with ex-hookups and living with one is a normal, reasonable response - not asshole behavior.

The girlfriend's actions suggest either poor boundary awareness in relationships or dismissiveness of her partner's legitimate concerns. While people can maintain friendships with exes, actively flirting and the living arrangement she's created would test most relationships.

You've engaged in snooping behavior twice now - first early in the relationship (which caused a breakup), and now again despite knowing how destructive it was before. Even after she explained her reasonable boundary about Facebook (citing harassment from a previous relationship), you chose to investigate her gaming activity instead of trusting her or having an honest conversation about your concerns.

The fact that you found evidence she was more active than she claimed doesn't justify the violation of privacy. There could be many explanations - maybe gaming was a low-energy distraction during illness, maybe she needed space but didn't know how to communicate that, or maybe she was indeed being deceptive. But the way to handle relationship concerns is through direct communication, not surveillance.

Your pattern of snooping, combined with admitting to ""trust issues,"" suggests you may not have been ready for this relationship. Trust is fundamental, and repeatedly violating someone's privacy when you feel suspicious is not a healthy way to address relationship problems.

The author waited a full week to bring up their hurt feelings about not receiving a birthday message, doing so late at night (11 PM) via text. While their feelings of hurt are understandable - birthdays are important and they had put effort into creating a thoughtful collage for their twin - the way and when they addressed it was problematic.

The sister's responses, while defensive, aren't unreasonable. She pointed out the unfairness of bringing up a week-old issue late at night, and questioned why the author waited so long to mention something that was apparently hurtful. Her suggestion that the author was ""making up a reason to be resentful"" may have been harsh, but her core point about the timing being unfair has merit.

The author's decision to wait a week ""hoping you would still end up sending something out eventually"" suggests they were building up resentment rather than addressing the issue directly when it happened. Bringing it up late at night via confrontational text (""what's that all about?"") was not the most constructive approach.

The author ate leftover food that his date didn't finish, which she had left at his place overnight. While he paid for the food, the key issue is whether it was reasonable for him to assume the leftovers were fair game without asking.

In most social contexts, when someone leaves food uneaten - especially overnight at someone else's place - it's generally considered abandoned unless explicitly stated otherwise. The author was hungry, had no time to make breakfast, and the food was at his own residence. His assumption that the leftovers were available seems reasonable under these circumstances.

The date's reaction calling it ""rude"" seems like an overreach. If she wanted to save the food, the polite thing would have been to either take it with her or explicitly mention she'd like to have it later. Leaving food overnight at someone's place and then being upset they ate it creates an unreasonable expectation.

The author admits to having a crush on the woman and acknowledges this created bias. They conducted what amounts to an amateur investigation based on internet ""witch hunts"" - notoriously unreliable sources. Most critically, they acted on conjecture and incomplete information, admitting they ""couldn't get any details"" and were basing judgments on unreliable sources.

The author inserted themselves into someone else's relationship based on:
- Unverified internet rumors
- Guilt by association (the boyfriend's friend's alleged involvement in revenge porn)
- Their own admitted bias due to romantic interest

While the author shows some self-awareness about their problematic motivations and the potential harm caused, this doesn't excuse the actions. They violated boundaries by investigating someone's private life and sharing unsubstantiated allegations that ultimately broke up a relationship.

The boyfriend's anger is completely understandable given that someone spread unverified accusations about them. The girlfriend appears to be an innocent party caught in the middle.

D is putting M's professional reputation and livelihood at risk by continuing to smoke while knowing he needs to pass a drug test for a job M is recommending him for. M specifically made passing the drug test a condition because failing would damage his credibility and potentially affect his income. D's decision to continue smoking shows disregard for the risk he's placing on M, who is trying to help him.

However, the author is considering telling C (M's wife) about D's behavior, which would likely lead to M withdrawing the recommendation. While this protects M from potential professional damage, it also involves the author in family drama and could strain relationships, especially with pregnant sister P who is already in a difficult situation.

The core issue is D's irresponsible behavior - he's accepting help while secretly undermining the conditions of that help. M has a right to know that his professional reputation is being put at risk so he can make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the recommendation.

The author made some questionable decisions, particularly allowing guests to eat food that they knew contained blood. This is a serious food safety issue that could have put people at risk of bloodborne pathogens. The author also chose not to speak up when they witnessed Aaron bleeding into the food, prioritizing avoiding confrontation over guest safety.

However, Aaron bears significant responsibility here. He was recklessly aggressive while grating cheese, injured himself, and continued grating while bleeding into the food without stopping or alerting anyone. His wildly inaccurate estimate of how much food he and Stan would eat (claiming they'd eat 2 pounds each when they barely ate any) also contributed to the waste and financial burden.

Stan appears less directly involved but still overestimated his consumption and benefited from the author's financial loss.

The guests are not at fault - they had no knowledge of the blood contamination or the financial arrangements.

While the author's frustration about the food waste and financial loss is understandable, the most serious issue is the food safety violation.

The author is contemplating asking their friend for a sexual favor in exchange for money, knowing their friend is in financial need. While the author frames this as potentially acceptable because their friend is ""okay"" with discussing private topics, there are several concerning elements:

1. The friend has already shown they don't want to discuss the author's romantic feelings much (""doesn't want to talk much about obviously"")

The author stayed in a relationship for over a year without romantic feelings, which was unfair to both parties. While the intention to support their girlfriend during a difficult time was compassionate, the execution was misguided. By remaining in the relationship while being emotionally unavailable and forcing affection, the author likely caused their girlfriend to feel confused, rejected, and insecure during an already vulnerable time. The author even acknowledges that their girlfriend probably sensed something was wrong, meaning the intended emotional support was undermined by the dishonesty of the situation.

The fundamental issue is that the author made a unilateral decision about what was ""best"" for their girlfriend without giving her the agency to make informed choices about her own life and relationships. A more honest approach - either working to rekindle feelings, having an open conversation about the relationship status, or ending things respectfully while offering friendship/support - would have been more ethical.

- Assumed that because others thought they looked like a couple, she would automatically say yes to dating
- Got angry when she politely declined, despite her right to not be romantically interested
- Became upset about her avoiding him after he asked her out, when giving space after romantic rejection is completely normal and healthy
- Sent an ambiguous message that could reasonably be interpreted as accusatory, then got ""set off"" when she responded defensively
- Seems to feel entitled to her romantic interest based on their friendship activities

- Gave him space after the romantic rejection (which is appropriate)

- Based on wanting to help M genuinely escape the situation

M repeatedly violated this boundary by:

- Continuing contact despite warnings

- Being dishonest about her activities on Valentine's Day

The final confrontation, while perhaps blunt, was justified after multiple violations and lies. The authors had already shown considerable patience by taking her back after the first violation.

We'd say grace...,Other,Other,0.8,0.9230769230769231,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the competing values and perspectives at play.

The author has legitimate moral objections to attending Catholic mass based on deeply held convictions about institutional issues and support for LGBTQ+ family members. At 21, they are an adult capable of making their own religious decisions. Their desire to act according to their conscience is understandable and valid.

However, the parents also have understandable motivations - wanting family unity during holidays and likely viewing this as important family tradition and bonding time. The pattern of fights suggests this creates genuine distress for them as well.

The key factors that influence my assessment:
- The author is an adult who has the right to make their own religious choices
- They've communicated their position clearly over multiple years
- They're not trying to stop their parents from attending or being disrespectful about their beliefs
- They're simply asking to opt out of participation in something that conflicts with their moral convictions
- The parents continue to pressure them despite knowing their stance

While I understand the parents' desire for family participation in traditions, continuing to pressure an adult child to participate in religious activities they morally object to, especially after years of clear communication, crosses into problematic territory. The author has tried compromise in the past and is now setting a reasonable boundary.

The parents need to respect their adult child's autonomy and find ways to maintain family connection that don't require compromising deeply held moral convictions.

The author is asking their best friend to share referral bonus points that the friend would earn by referring them for a credit card. The author's reasoning is that without them signing up, the friend wouldn't get any points at all, so it's ""only fair"" to share.

However, referral programs are designed as incentives for the existing customer to bring in new business. The friend would be doing the referring work and earning the bonus as intended by the credit card company. The author would also be getting their own welcome offer points from signing up.

While it's understandable the author might hope their friend would share or treat them to dinner, demanding it and calling the friend unfair for keeping their own earned referral bonus seems unreasonable. The friend has no obligation to share rewards they earn through the referral program, especially when the author is also benefiting by getting the credit card they wanted with their own welcome bonus.

The hostel staff's response was also inappropriate. While they correctly noted that pest control supplies weren't available at 9 PM and offered a refund, their comments about ""leaving open food"" (without evidence), telling you to ""just go if you don't like it here,"" and especially the later unprofessional messages telling you to ""be a man"" and ""not think like a kid"" were completely unacceptable customer service.

Both parties escalated the situation unnecessarily. You made unreasonable demands given the circumstances and cultural context, while the staff responded unprofessionally and rudely instead of handling the situation with basic courtesy and understanding.

They're not overreacting - being forced to subsidize other people's more expensive meals and drinks when you're having money troubles is legitimately frustrating, especially when the group shows no willingness to accommodate a fair solution.

The proper approach would have been for the group to either ask everyone before splitting equally, or to calculate individual portions when there's such a clear difference in what people ordered.

The author made an understandable technical mistake - forgetting that deleted photos remain in Google Photos backup. However, the core issue isn't the technical error, but rather saving pornographic images in the first place while in a committed relationship. Many people would consider this a form of boundary crossing, even if the author sees it as harmless since they don't know the person in the images.

The girlfriend's reaction of feeling like trust has been broken is a reasonable emotional response to discovering saved intimate images of another person on her partner's phone. Different people have different boundaries around pornography in relationships, and her feelings are valid.

However, the author did delete the images from their gallery immediately after, showing some awareness that keeping them wasn't appropriate. The fact they remained in Google Photos was genuinely an oversight rather than intentional deception.

The author is being somewhat dismissive by thinking the girlfriend is ""overreacting"" rather than trying to understand why this would be hurtful to her. At the same time, the girlfriend's declaration that she ""can't trust"" him anymore seems like a strong reaction to what was ultimately a technical oversight of images the author had already tried to delete.

Both parties have some responsibility here - the author for the initial action and dismissive attitude, and both for not having clearer communication about boundaries around pornography in their relationship.

The partner's comment about not knowing ""these things"" was somewhat dismissive, but the author's response - questioning how a 22-year-old doesn't know February is shorter - was patronizing and hurtful. While February being shorter is common knowledge, the partner may have simply been caught off guard by the rent timing change or expressed themselves poorly in the moment.

The author recognized the harshness by apologizing after seeing their partner cry, which shows some awareness that the response was inappropriate. However, the ""but damn?"" at the end suggests they still feel justified in their reaction rather than fully taking responsibility for being needlessly condescending.

Both contributed to escalating what could have been a simple clarification about rent timing into an emotional conflict.

The author claims it was a ""throwaway comment"" and seems frustrated that their partner was hurt by it.

While it's natural to still notice attractive people when in a relationship, the way this was communicated appears to have been insensitive. The author's defensive tone and sarcastic comment about ""all attractive people falling off the face of the earth"" suggests a lack of empathy for their partner's feelings. Even if the intention wasn't to hurt, the impact clearly did, and the author seems more focused on being ""right"" than understanding why their partner was upset.

The partner's reaction of feeling hurt seems reasonable given how the comment was apparently phrased or delivered. However, without knowing exactly what was said or the full context of their response, it's difficult to assess if there was any overreaction.

The author bears primary responsibility for the insensitive communication and dismissive attitude toward their partner's feelings.

The key factors here are:
- This is a business trip with company reimbursement
- The coworker will receive mileage reimbursement (50+ cents per mile) that covers gas and vehicle wear
- The author would be a passenger, not sharing driving duties
- There are alternative transportation options available
- The coworker chose to drive (whether she offered or was asked)

The mileage reimbursement rate is specifically designed to cover all vehicle-related costs including gas, maintenance, and depreciation. Since the company is already compensating the driver for these expenses, expecting additional gas money from a passenger would essentially be double compensation.

This is different from a personal trip where friends typically split costs. In a business context with proper reimbursement, the financial burden is already being handled by the employer.

The author isn't being unreasonable or cheap - they're correctly understanding that the business reimbursement structure already accounts for the transportation costs.

However IMO the kit...",Other,Other,0.8,0.6,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the dynamics of shared living space and reasonable expectations for both parties.

The author appears to be living with someone (likely a roommate or family member) who has taken over the kitchen as their primary workspace for studying, group meetings, presentations, and professional video calls. The author feels they can't freely use the kitchen for its intended purpose - cooking and eating - without disrupting the other person's activities.

The author's frustration seems reasonable. Kitchens are primarily meant for food preparation and eating, and everyone in a household should have reasonable access to prepare meals when hungry. The other person has essentially monopolized a shared common area for activities that could be done elsewhere (they mention there are 2 other living rooms available).

However, the author's contemplated response - deliberately making noise during professional calls while in pajamas - would be petty and potentially harmful to the other person's work/academic commitments.

The core issue is that the other person is being inconsiderate by monopolizing shared space, especially when alternatives exist. The author has a legitimate grievance but is considering an inappropriate response.

Let me analyze the key points:

The girlfriend has been licking the ice cream lid after they eat past the first layer, reasoning that it ""isn't touching"" the remaining ice cream. When the author expressed being upset and grossed out upon discovering this, she dismissed their reaction as ""overreacting.""

From a hygiene perspective, the author's concern is understandable - saliva can transfer bacteria and many people would find this practice unsanitary when sharing food. However, the girlfriend may genuinely not see this as problematic and might feel the author's reaction was disproportionate.

The core issue seems to be a lack of communication about boundaries and hygiene preferences in their relationship. Neither person is fundamentally wrong for their perspective, but both could have handled this better - the girlfriend by being more considerate of hygiene when sharing food, and the author by addressing concerns more calmly rather than getting ""pissed.""

This behavior shows a lack of awareness about social boundaries and can be genuinely annoying for friends who want to have normal conversations about other topics.

However, your response of ""No one cares"" is unnecessarily harsh and dismissive. While your frustration is understandable, this approach is likely to damage the friendship and escalate conflict rather than resolve the issue. A more constructive approach would be to have an honest conversation about how his behavior affects your interactions, or to set gentle boundaries like ""Hey, can we talk about something else for a bit?""

The author witnessed what appeared to be genuine mean-spirited behavior from A's ""friends"" - calling her names, mocking her academic struggles, and even joking about tampering with her food. The author's intention to protect someone from being mistreated by people she trusted seems genuinely compassionate.

However, the execution was problematic. The author admits to speaking ""maybe a bit loudly"" and embellished the account by suggesting the friends might have actually spit in the food (which they didn't witness). They also inserted themselves into a complex social dynamic they admittedly knew nothing about - they don't know these people or the full context of their relationships.

The two friends were clearly behaving badly by talking behind A's back in such a cruel manner, especially after she had just been helpful and supportive to them.

A appears to be an innocent party who was hurt both by her friends' betrayal and by learning about it in a public, potentially humiliating way.

While the author's heart was in the right place wanting to protect someone from fake friends, the way they handled it - loudly, publicly, with embellishments, and without full context - caused additional harm to the situation. The friends' behavior was worse, but the author's poor execution also contributed to the damage.

Your concern about the stepfather's trustworthiness as executor appears to stem from legitimate past experiences (manipulation, infidelity). As executor decisions can have significant financial and emotional consequences for beneficiaries, sharing this concern once was reasonable - especially since she specifically asked you first and you have a direct stake in how the estate is handled.

However, your mother is a competent adult facing a terminal diagnosis who gets to make her own choices about her relationships and estate planning. She's already heard your perspective. Continuing to voice the same concerns would likely create additional stress during an already overwhelming time, potentially damage your relationship with her, and could come across as self-serving since you were originally chosen as executor.

The most supportive approach would be to focus on being there for her emotionally while respecting her decisions, even if you disagree with them.

The author has an established friendship with B that predates the romantic relationship, and the boyfriend has apparently been okay with these sleepovers for a year without complaint. The sudden objection seems inconsistent. Additionally, the boyfriend's own dishonesty about his job and his claims about friends trying to sleep with him raise questions about his credibility and potential projection.

However, relationships do involve ongoing communication about boundaries, and people can develop new concerns over time. The boyfriend is entitled to express discomfort, even if his timing seems poor.

The core issue appears to be a lack of clear communication about boundaries and expectations in their relationship, compounded by trust issues on both sides. The author seems to be operating under the assumption that past acceptance means ongoing acceptance, while the boyfriend may have developed new concerns he hadn't previously voiced.

Neither person appears to be fundamentally wrong - the author is maintaining a long-standing friendship, and the boyfriend is expressing relationship concerns (albeit inconsistently and possibly hypocritically given his own situation).

The mother made a deliberate choice to take prescription drugs that weren't prescribed to her, believing they would be ""good to take while travelling."" This was an irresponsible decision that had predictable negative consequences - the drugs ""messed up her body,"" prevented proper sleep for weeks, and weakened her immune system, leading to illness.

The direct chain of causation is clear: unprescribed medication → weakened immune system → illness → transmission to daughter through shared sleeping arrangements → daughter's ruined Christmas.

The author (daughter) had no control over:
- Her mother's decision to take unprescribed drugs
- The sleeping arrangements (limited by finances)
- Being exposed to her mother's illness
- Getting sick as a result

The mother's actions were:
- Medically dangerous (taking unprescribed drugs)
- Irresponsible 
- Directly harmful to both herself and her daughter

The author is technically within their legal rights to enforce the custody schedule - they've maintained strict boundaries for 8 years, which has likely provided stability. However, this appears to be an exceptional circumstance: a once-in-a-lifetime extended family reunion at Disneyland that cannot be rescheduled due to multiple family members' availability.

While the ex shouldn't have told the children about the trip before securing agreement (which put them in an emotionally difficult position), the author's rigid adherence to the schedule in this specific case seems to prioritize the custody arrangement over the children's opportunity for a significant family experience.

The author's refusal to even consider alternatives like switching weeks suggests inflexibility that may not serve the children's best interests. The children's strong emotional reactions indicate they view this as their parent preventing them from a meaningful family experience, regardless of the technical custody rights involved.

Both parents bear some responsibility - the ex for poor communication and timing, and the author for inflexibility in an exceptional situation. However, the author's unwillingness to consider any compromise for what appears to be a rare, significant family event tips the balance.

The author is caught between:
- A father who cheated and caused the family split, leading to a distant relationship
- Family members who dislike the father and would be uncomfortable with his presence
- Their own conflicted feelings about wanting their father there vs. avoiding family tension
- Financial dependence that complicates the relationship

The author is genuinely trying to navigate this thoughtfully - they're considering everyone's feelings, have already discussed it with family who said ""it's up to you,"" and are planning to give advance notice if they do invite him. They're also working hard to become financially independent through scholarships.

The father, while he provides financial support, created this situation through his infidelity and has maintained only a distant relationship with his child. However, he hasn't been described as actively harmful or manipulative currently.

The mother and siblings have understandable feelings given the betrayal, but they've appropriately told the author this decision is theirs to make.

This appears to be a situation where past actions (the father's infidelity) created an unfortunate dynamic, but currently everyone is trying to handle a difficult situation as best they can.

The uncle clearly crossed a major line by hitting the author first. Physical violence over something as minor as buying ketchup is completely unacceptable, regardless of any frustration about the author's lifestyle or responsiveness. This escalation to violence makes the uncle primarily at fault for how the conflict unfolded.

However, the author also bears some responsibility. While depression is a serious condition that affects motivation and daily functioning, the author acknowledges being ""lazy as FUCK"" and doing very little around the house beyond minimal tasks. Living rent-free as an adult while contributing almost nothing creates legitimate frustration for family members. Additionally, when someone is cooking for the household, a reasonable request to pick up a missing ingredient shouldn't require extended negotiation over a video game.

The author's defensive punch was understandable as a reaction to being hit, but the escalation and inflammatory language (""piece of shit"") contributed to making the situation worse.

The family dynamics seem dysfunctional overall, with the grandmother and mother appearing to normalize the uncle's violence to some degree, which is concerning.

The author posting about bridesmaid dresses on social media without any direct communication could understandably hurt someone's feelings.

The friend's response - talking behind the author's back to mutual friends instead of addressing this directly - is problematic. But the author also didn't make any effort to reach out during those 4 months of silence or communicate about the wedding planning.

Both parties contributed to this situation through poor communication. The friend created the problem by going silent after her wedding, but the author could have handled the bridesmaid selection more thoughtfully given their recent reconnection.

The facts are clear: you currently have a court-ordered arrangement giving you 8 days per month with your son while the mother has 22 days. She's asking you to reduce your time further to every other weekend (which would be approximately 4 days per month), citing her school schedule as making it difficult to spend quality time with him during her current 22 days.

Your position is entirely reasonable. You already have significantly less time with your child than the mother does. The court established this arrangement for a reason, and you're simply wanting to maintain the limited time you were legally granted. Her being in school, while understandable as a challenge, doesn't justify further reducing your already minimal parenting time - especially when she has the vast majority of days with your son.

If she's struggling to balance school and parenting during her 22 days, that's a scheduling challenge she needs to work through, not something that should come at the expense of your relationship with your child.

The author has clearly communicated their boundaries multiple times - they don't enjoy silent phone calls and value their commute time for work preparation. They were honest when directly asked if they wanted to get off the phone, and they apologized when their fiancé's feelings were hurt.

However, the fiancé's behavior is concerning. She repeatedly ignores expressed boundaries, calls back multiple times when the author is trying to work, and then becomes ""hateful"" and hostile when her behavior is addressed. While her feelings of rejection are understandable, her response - including the aggressive language and refusal to acknowledge the author's apologies - crosses into problematic territory.

The author could potentially have been more tactful in their delivery, but being direct when directly asked isn't inherently wrong. The core issue is that one person is repeatedly violating clearly stated boundaries and then becoming hostile when those boundaries are maintained.

The fiancé appears to be primarily at fault for not respecting boundaries and escalating the conflict inappropriately, though the author might have handled the moment with slightly more sensitivity.

The brother missed the birthday dinner, which ended at 9 PM. The brother would have faced a long drive home, getting back around 10-11 PM, then needing to wake up at 7:45 AM for a 9 AM work start. This means roughly 8-9 hours between getting home and waking up, which is actually quite reasonable for sleep.

However, the key issue here is the author's inflexible approach. The brother:
- Acknowledged missing the event
- Took initiative to make amends by offering to host a makeup celebration
- Showed he cares about maintaining their relationship

The author's response is to completely reject this gesture based on a rigid principle of ""no do-overs,"" even though the brother's reason (long drive + early work) was understandable, if not entirely compelling.

While the brother could have made more effort to attend the original event, his attempt to make amends shows good faith. The author's unwillingness to accept any gesture of reconciliation seems unnecessarily harsh and potentially damaging to their relationship.

The author has made a reasonable offer to use their travel points for free accommodation at a quality hotel that's only a 10-minute walk away. They're already investing significant time and money to attend a wedding for people they don't know personally, purely to support their girlfriend.

The girlfriend wants to stay with the wedding party at the designated hotel, which would cost $250/night. While her desire to be close to the wedding activities is understandable, she's asking her partner to spend an additional $500 when a perfectly good free alternative exists just 10 minutes away.

The author is being financially responsible and generous by offering to use their points. The girlfriend's insistence on the more expensive option, especially when her partner is already making significant sacrifices to attend, seems unreasonable. A 10-minute walk is not a substantial inconvenience that would justify the extra expense.

The author describes being trapped in repetitive, one-sided conversations about their friend's hometown and heritage.

The friend also seems to lack awareness of social cues - the author was clearly focused on eating and not engaging, yet she continued talking.

However, when directly asked if they were interested, the author responded bluntly with ""no, not really"" and later called the conversation ""meaningless."" While honest, this was unnecessarily harsh and dismissive of something that clearly matters deeply to their friend. There were more tactful ways to handle this, such as suggesting they talk about it later or gently redirecting the conversation.

The friend's reaction of storming off and getting defensive, while understandable given the blunt rejection, also shows poor communication skills and an inability to recognize that conversations should involve mutual interest and engagement.

The author has legitimate reasons to be frustrated - being stood up 5 times in a row, with the most recent incident involving complete radio silence during the planned date, followed by a delayed explanation that seems questionable. Even if she truly lost her phone, there were other ways to communicate (asking a coworker to call, using the restaurant's phone, etc.), and the lack of any apology compounds the issue.

However, simply ghosting someone without any communication about why you're ending things, while understandable given the frustration, isn't the most mature approach. A brief message explaining that the repeated cancellations aren't working for him would be more direct and honest.

That said, the other person's pattern of making plans and consistently bailing, culminating in leaving someone waiting with no communication, shows a significant lack of respect for the author's time and feelings. This behavior is more problematic than the author's decision to disengage.

- You've been dropping ""not so subtle hints"" about wanting a specific game for weeks
- Your friend got you a similar game in the same genre that they genuinely thought you'd enjoy

The fact that you're considering continuing to hint about the other game after receiving this gift would definitely cross into problematic territory.

The author states it was ""pretty clear"" this was just a hookup, but this assumption appears to be based on what he *didn't* say rather than clear communication. The fact that Cindy is asking about future dates and has developed feelings suggests the expectations weren't actually aligned. Her inexperience (possibly being a virgin) and insecurity should have been red flags that she might not approach casual encounters the same way he does.

While the author isn't obligated to pursue a relationship he doesn't want, completely ignoring someone after intimacy - especially someone who was clearly inexperienced and vulnerable - shows a lack of basic courtesy and empathy. A simple, honest conversation about his intentions would have been the decent thing to do.

Cindy may have misread signals or hoped for more than was offered, but given her apparent inexperience, this seems more understandable than blameworthy.

Your husband has been engaging in his hobby throughout the day, which is reasonable. However, several factors make his approach problematic: he's asking you to approve spending money on a game he previously agreed to stop purchasing for (after spending $2,000), he's refusing any compromise when you're asking for some shared time together, and he's being somewhat dismissive of your feelings by framing this as you trying to stop his enjoyment rather than seeking connection.

On your side, your disappointment is understandable - you've been handling household responsibilities and want some quality time together. However, the timing of your request (when he's already engaged in a time-limited event) and the way it's presented as an ultimatum could be improved.

The real issue isn't about the gaming itself, but about finding balance between individual interests and relationship time, and honoring previous agreements about spending.

The author discovered their fiancé was actively participating in incest-themed pornography subreddits. While pornography consumption itself isn't inherently wrong, the author's reaction - including preventing him from being alone with their children - suggests they view this as crossing a significant boundary in their relationship.

The fiancé's response that he ""isn't into it personally"" while being active in multiple incest subreddits appears contradictory and potentially dishonest. However, there's an important distinction between fantasy consumption and real-world behavior or intentions.

The author's protective response regarding their children, while understandable from an emotional standpoint, represents a serious escalation that suggests either the relationship has fundamental trust issues or the author may be overreacting based on fear rather than evidence of actual risk.

The core issue seems to be a mismatch in boundaries and values around pornography, combined with poor communication. The fiancé should have been more honest about his consumption habits given that ""porn has always been a big issue"" in their relationship. The author's reaction, while emotionally understandable, may be disproportionate without additional concerning behaviors.

This appears to be a relationship compatibility issue where both parties bear some responsibility - the fiancé for not being transparent about something that clearly crosses the author's boundaries, and the author for making serious accusations about child safety without evidence beyond pornography consumption.

- They had been broken before by another friend
- Dave had ""fixed"" them previously, but they broke again after just a few minutes of use

When you borrow something that's already in poor condition and it breaks during normal use, the responsibility typically falls on the owner who chose to lend out damaged equipment. Dave knew the strings were worn and had been previously broken and repaired. By lending it out in that condition, he accepted the risk that they might break again.

The fact that the strings broke after only ""a few minutes"" of normal use strongly suggests they were at the end of their usable life, not that you caused damage through misuse or negligence.

The author was frustrated after what they perceived as poor officiating in their basketball game. While this frustration is understandable, they chose to publicly post a disrespectful tweet about the referees using profanity. Even though they thought they were being ""creative,"" the tweet was inappropriate and violated school policy regarding respectful conduct.

The school administration responded to a clear policy violation. Schools typically have social media policies and codes of conduct that students agree to follow, and using profanity to publicly disparage officials at a school event would reasonably fall under such policies. The consequence (losing a medal) seems proportionate to the violation.

The referees were doing their job officiating a game. While the author felt the calls were wrong, there's no indication the referees acted inappropriately or outside their professional duties. Poor calls (if they were indeed poor) are part of sports, not misconduct.

The author has legitimate concerns about consent and boundaries. If their girlfriend continues to engage in behavior she knows will turn them on after they've explicitly said no to sex, that does cross important boundaries around sexual consent. The timing issues (after fights, in public) also suggest a lack of respect for appropriate contexts.

However, the girlfriend's need for general affection and kissing appears to be separate from sexual activity in her mind. The author seems to be conflating all physical affection with sexual manipulation, which may not be fair. Her accusation about lack of affection suggests she feels her basic emotional needs aren't being met.

The core issue appears to be a fundamental mismatch in how they view physical affection, combined with poor communication about boundaries and needs. The author's approach of telling her to ""back off"" rather than having a constructive conversation about boundaries was likely hurtful and dismissive of her emotional needs.

The author's position is that when someone invites others to their place as an ""after party host,"" they should cover the transportation costs to get there, similar to how they cover food and drinks when hosting at their own place. They argue it's unfair that they'd pay $6 to get to Mitch's place plus $14 to get home ($20 total) while Mitch only pays $6.

Mitch's position is straightforward: they all shared the cab, so they should split the fare equally.

However, there are several factors that support the author's stance:
1. Mitch was the one who insisted they come to his place despite the author's initial hesitation
2. The author and Caleb regularly host without asking for reimbursement for food/drinks
3. Mitch failed as a host (passed out early, didn't provide adequate refreshments)
4. The geographic situation means the author and Caleb bear a disproportionate transportation burden

While splitting cab fares is a common practice among friends, the context of hosting creates different expectations. When you invite people to your place as the host, there's typically an understanding that you're taking on certain costs. The fact that both Mitch and Rob think the author is wrong suggests there may be different social expectations in their friend group, but the author's position is reasonable given standard hosting etiquette.

The author's girlfriend was clearly struggling financially due to medical debt but had explicitly told him early on that her finances were ""none of his business."" She was trying to maintain independence while secretly dealing with food insecurity. When she asked for $2 for a tamale after not eating at brunch, she was likely genuinely hungry but too proud to admit her financial struggles.

The author, however, was operating without full information due to his girlfriend's earlier boundary-setting. His frustration about her eye-rolling at the bill and apparent inconsistency (claiming not to be hungry, then wanting food) is understandable. However, his response was harsh - telling her to ""fine, don't get a tamale then"" when she explained about not wanting to withdraw $20 for a $2 purchase, and then snapping at her when she said she was hungry.

The girlfriend's approach was problematic too - she set a boundary about finances being private, then expected him to read between the lines about her struggles. Her accusation that she ""knew"" he would judge her suggests she was projecting her own shame onto him rather than communicating openly.

Both parties failed to communicate effectively. She should have been more direct about her financial struggles instead of expecting him to intuit her needs, and he should have shown more empathy when she finally opened up about being food insecure, rather than dismissing her claims.

The author made a deeply problematic decision to reveal extremely personal and traumatic information about their sister's past abuse without her consent. This information involved sexual trauma and exploitation - details that were absolutely not the author's to share. The sister's past experiences with abuse and trafficking are her private information to disclose or not disclose as she chooses.

The author's justification that the boyfriend ""deserved to know"" and that most people ""wouldn't want to be with her"" because of her trauma history reveals harmful victim-blaming attitudes. Survivors of abuse have every right to control their own narrative and decide when, how, and if they share their experiences.

The boyfriend's angry reaction and the sister's decision to cut contact are completely understandable responses to this massive violation of privacy and trust. The author then compounded the harm by demanding an apology from the boyfriend, showing no recognition of their own wrongdoing.

While the author may have believed they were acting with good intentions, the impact was devastating - they betrayed their sister's trust, violated her privacy regarding traumatic experiences, and potentially damaged her relationship.

844,"For my entire life (I’m 20) my father has been out of the picture, he left me and my mom when I was like 4 months old due to circumstances that I am not aware of but I’m sure are dicey to talk about g...",Other,Nobody,0.85,0.625,False,"I understand this is an incredibly overwhelming and emotionally complex situation for you. Let me work through this carefully.

You're dealing with someone who abandoned you as an infant and then reappeared 20 years later via Facebook messenger - hardly the most thoughtful or appropriate way to reconnect with a child you left behind. Your feelings of resentment are completely valid and natural. You have every right to feel conflicted about whether to engage with him.

However, this isn't really about fault in the traditional sense. Your father clearly made a significant mistake by leaving when you were a baby, but without knowing the full circumstances (which you mentioned might involve drugs or other serious issues), it's hard to definitively judge his actions from 20 years ago. People can change, and his apparent remorse suggests he may recognize his past mistakes.

Your reaction - feeling overwhelmed, resentful, and uncertain - is entirely reasonable and doesn't make you an ""ass"" at all. You're not obligated to forgive him or let him into your life just because he's apologetic. You have the right to protect your emotional well-being and take as much time as you need to process this.

This seems like a situation where everyone is dealing with the consequences of past decisions and current emotions, but no one is necessarily being unreasonable in the present moment.

845,"To start, I don't use facebook. I think I made 2 posts in the last year, neither of which were important at all. I don't even log in. Almost missed a graduation party because the invite came through f...",Other,Everybody,0.8,0.5294117647058824,False,"Looking at this situation, I see a fundamental incompatibility in how two people view social media and relationship validation, but the core issue seems to be about communication and understanding each other's perspectives.

The author has clearly established boundaries around social media use and has legitimate reasons for avoiding it. They demonstrate their commitment through substantial real-world actions - spending 4-6 days together weekly, involving their children, planning trips, etc. Their preference for privacy over public displays is a valid personal choice.

However, the girlfriend also has legitimate feelings about wanting some form of public acknowledgment of their relationship. While her specific focus on Facebook posting might seem trivial to the author, her underlying need for reassurance about the relationship's status is understandable.

The real issue appears to be that neither person is making a genuine effort to understand or accommodate the other's perspective. The author is dismissive of her concerns as ""petty"" and ""high school drama,"" while she's trying to force compliance rather than seeking compromise. Both are taking rigid stances without exploring middle ground solutions.

The friend's advice seems unhelpful and potentially inflammatory, but she's not the primary party in this relationship conflict.

This appears to be a case where both people have valid but incompatible needs, and both are handling the disagreement poorly by being inflexible and dismissive of each other's concerns.

846,"Okay, I'll do my best to make this brief.

I recently found out I will have to go to Wisconsin for some medical reasons unimportant to the story. For years, my friend and I have ""game shared"" on PS4. ...",Author,Author,0.85,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the financial arrangements, the technical realities of game sharing, and the impact on both parties.

The key facts are:
- Both parties equally split the costs of the games
- The games were purchased through the author's account (giving them technical control)
- The author has a legitimate need to access the games offline for medical reasons
- Changing the sharing arrangement would leave the friend unable to access games they helped pay for
- The friend would have no way to recover their financial investment

While the author has the technical right to change the sharing settings and a valid reason for needing offline access, unilaterally making this change would effectively take away games that the friend co-purchased. The friend invested money with the reasonable expectation of continued access to these games.

The ethical approach would be to discuss this situation with the friend first. Potential solutions could include:
- Temporarily changing settings just for the trip period
- The author compensating the friend for their share of affected games
- Finding alternative arrangements
- The friend agreeing to the change given the medical circumstances

Taking unilateral action without discussion, despite the technical ability to do so, would be unfair to someone who financially contributed to these purchases.

847,"Let me preface this by saying that I love both my parents very much. Ever since I was a kid, my dad has always incorporated me and my brother into his Valentine's day gift to my mom. For example, he o...",Other,Other,0.8,0.6666666666666666,False,"Looking at this situation, I can understand your confusion. Your dad established a pattern when you were children of including you in joint gifts, but now expects you to give separate gifts for both Valentine's Day and your mom's birthday just days apart, while becoming hostile when questioned about this expectation.

Your questioning seems reasonable - Valentine's Day is traditionally a romantic holiday between partners, and having two gift-giving occasions so close together (February 14th and 21st) does create financial pressure. Your dad's explosive reaction to a legitimate question about his expectations was disproportionate and inappropriate.

However, this appears to stem from your dad's strong feelings about showing appreciation for your mother rather than malicious intent. His reaction, while wrong, seems to come from a place of wanting to ensure your mom feels loved and valued.

You're not being an asshole for questioning this arrangement or feeling confused about the expectations and reaction you received.

848,"My girlfriend opened up that she wants to transition to a guy. Ive always known her bi tendencies, but the fact she wants to change is too much to me. We’ve gotten to the point in dating where our lov...",Other,Nobody,0.85,0.918918918918919,True,"This is a deeply personal and complex situation involving gender identity, sexual orientation, and relationship compatibility. Let me analyze this carefully.

The author is grappling with their partner's gender transition and questioning whether their response makes them at fault. Key considerations:

- The author's partner has shared they want to transition to male
- The author identifies as straight and is struggling with continuing the relationship if their partner transitions
- Both parties seem to genuinely love each other
- The author is questioning their own reaction and seeking perspective

Sexual orientation and attraction are fundamental aspects of identity that people generally cannot simply choose to change. A straight person not being attracted to someone who identifies as male is not a moral failing - it's an aspect of their sexual orientation. Similarly, the partner's need to transition is a valid expression of their gender identity.

This appears to be a situation where two people with legitimate needs and identities may simply be incompatible, despite their love for each other. Neither person is wrong for being who they are or having the needs they have.

The author is not at fault for their sexual orientation, and the partner is not at fault for their gender identity. This is a painful but natural incompatibility issue.

849,So my brother in law is a piece of work. First of all he’s been to jail multiple times in his life for things that are definitely his fault. He is a strain on society. He doesn’t work and stays at hom...,Author,Author,0.8,0.6153846153846154,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the core issue: whether someone's right to express political opinions should be contingent on their employment status or contribution to society.

While the brother-in-law's behavior and lifestyle choices may be frustrating, the fundamental right to political expression isn't dependent on employment status, tax contributions, or social approval. Even people who receive government assistance retain their citizenship rights, including freedom of speech and the right to criticize government.

The author's response - essentially arguing that the brother-in-law shouldn't be ""allowed"" to have political opinions due to his circumstances - crosses into problematic territory regarding basic democratic principles. This kind of gatekeeping about who deserves to participate in political discourse is concerning.

However, I can understand the author's frustration with what they perceive as hypocrisy (criticizing a system while benefiting from it) and their annoyance with constant political posts. The brother-in-law's pattern of behavior does seem problematic in many ways.

The author chose to publicly shame someone for exercising their right to political expression, which predictably damaged family relationships. While the frustration is understandable, the approach was counterproductive and based on a flawed premise about who gets to have political opinions.
