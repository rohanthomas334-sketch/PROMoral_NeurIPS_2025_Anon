The analysis clearly establishes:
- Parents bear the heaviest responsibility through abuse, enabling, and creating systemic inequality
- Author bears limited responsibility, significantly mitigated by trauma responses
- The ""Everybody"" classification is acknowledged as technically correct but heavily skewed

The key tension is whether a situation where one party bears 80% of the fault and another bears 20% (with significant mitigating factors) should be classified as ""Everybody"" or ""Other.""

Given that:
1. The parents created and maintain the fundamental dysfunction
2. The author's responsibility is limited and heavily mitigated by trauma
3. The analysis notes this could shift toward ""Other"" with more information about available alternatives
4. Trauma responses may not constitute genuine moral culpability

The 80/20 split with significant mitigation for the author suggests this falls closer to ""Other"" than true shared responsibility. When fault is this heavily weighted toward one party, and the lesser party's actions are largely trauma responses to the primary party's abuse, it indicates the primary party bears the predominant moral responsibility.

The author demonstrates fault through:
- Hiding the encounter with a ""problematic ex"" which violates open relationship transparency norms
- Making questionable partner choices that could reasonably upset their SO
- Using indirect communication rather than clearly expressing needs
- Showing hypocrisy by being upset about their SO's outside activities while engaging in potentially more problematic behavior themselves

The SO shows equally problematic behavior through:
- Consistently avoiding intimacy with their primary partner while actively seeking it elsewhere
- Failing to communicate reasons for the avoidance or discuss relationship concerns
- Displaying what appears to be deliberate compartmentalization or punishment behavior rather than natural desire fluctuation

Both partners have failed to establish proper open relationship foundations including clear communication protocols, appropriate boundaries, and regular relationship check-ins. They're using the open relationship structure to avoid addressing core intimacy issues rather than enhancing their primary relationship.

This isn't a case where one person is reactive to the other's behavior - both are actively contributing to a dysfunctional dynamic through poor choices and communication failures. The pattern shows mutual responsibility for the relationship deterioration.

The woman clearly bears primary responsibility through:
- Foundational deception about exclusivity during conception
- Years of failing to address obvious paternity questions
- Poor crisis management with angry messages instead of addressing concerns

The author bears secondary but significant responsibility through:
- Choosing the most disruptive revelation method (casual supermarket encounter)
- Waiting 3+ years, allowing bonds to solidify
- Acting from a ""nothing to lose"" mentality rather than principled motivations
- Poor timing and tactical insensitivity

The explanation establishes that even though the woman's deception created the fundamental problem, the author's handling was so poor that he bears ""significant independent responsibility"" for how the truth emerged. His failures ""transformed what could have been a private resolution into maximum chaos for all parties.""

This matches the ""Everybody"" classification perfectly - multiple parties making ethically questionable choices that compound into a worse outcome than any single person's actions would have created alone. The innocent partner suffers the most while bearing no fault, which reinforces why both other parties' failures are problematic.

The framework clearly establishes unequal but distributed responsibility, with both parties contributing meaningfully to the harmful outcome through different types of failures.

- Both parties were initially honest about their positions
- The boyfriend's change of heart appears genuine and triggered by an unplanned experience
- No evidence of deception or manipulation from either side
- The fundamental incompatibility emerged organically over time

The explanation demonstrates a thorough counterfactual analysis that considers the actions and motivations of both parties.

The key insight is that both parties engaged in behavior that corrupted institutional systems - the author weaponized harassment allegations for personal academic gain, while the teacher's immediate capitulation to grade changes when threatened suggests either actual misconduct or a willingness to compromise academic integrity under pressure. Neither party's behavior is excusable, and both contributed to undermining educational and safety systems.

The analysis effectively shows how the teacher's response (immediate grade change) is particularly telling - legitimate professionals typically don't respond to accusations by immediately offering grade modifications. This suggests either guilt or professional misconduct. Meanwhile, the author's admitted use of harassment claims as leverage for grades represents clear academic dishonesty and ethical violation.

The systemic implications are well-articulated - both parties corrupted systems designed to protect educational integrity and student safety for their own purposes.

4. The negative consequences were predictable and directly resulted from the author's deceptive behavior

The analysis effectively addresses why other categories don't apply - this wasn't mutual miscommunication or lack of information, but rather a unilateral decision to break an agreement. While the other person could have communicated more about their reasons, this doesn't change the fundamental ethical issue of deliberate deception.

The explanation identifies the Author as bearing 60% responsibility due to:
- Dishonesty about his true reasons (claiming ""personal problems"" instead of lack of attraction)
- Potentially proceeding with intimacy despite having doubts
- Poor timing that maximized emotional harm

However, the analysis also acknowledges significant complicating factors:
- 25% ""Info-needed"" due to missing context about expectations and prior indicators
- 15% ""Nobody"" due to the inherent unpredictability of physical chemistry
- Recognition that some incompatibilities only emerge through intimate experience

While the Author holds a plurality of responsibility at 60%, the substantial ambiguities (40% combined for info-needed and nobody elements) create enough uncertainty that I cannot be highly confident in assigning primary fault. The dishonesty is clearly problematic, but the fundamental unpredictability of attraction and missing contextual information significantly complicate the moral assessment.

The analysis itself notes these are ""complex moral ambiguities that prevent clear-cut fault assignment,"" which suggests meaningful uncertainty in the classification.

The author's tactless delivery and unnecessarily harsh communication style caused real harm, while the friend's unrealistic expectations and poor reception of feedback created an impossible situation. Both failed to establish proper boundaries and communication frameworks for their relationship.

The analysis convincingly rules out the other categories by showing there's sufficient information to make a judgment, both parties bear meaningful responsibility (not just one), and their mistakes were avoidable rather than blameless.

The explanation clearly establishes that all three parties - the farting customer, the author, and the bartender - each had reasonable alternatives available that could have prevented or de-escalated the conflict. Each party chose confrontational or defensive approaches rather than courtesy and problem-solving.

The analysis shows:
- The customer continued inappropriate public behavior without attempting mitigation
- The author chose direct confrontation over diplomatic alternatives 
- The bartender failed in conflict resolution and took sides unprofessionally

This represents what the explanation calls ""a classic breakdown in social contract where everyone chose confrontation or defensiveness over courtesy and problem-solving."" The fault is distributed across all parties with varying degrees of responsibility, but everyone bears some fault for their choices and actions.

While there is some ambiguity about the customer's medical status, the explanation notes that even with potential medical issues, some social responsibility remains. The core conclusion is that each party had agency and made choices that contributed to the conflict escalation.

The assessment clearly identifies the core issue: a parent refusing to participate in accessing potentially life-changing medical treatment for their child with epilepsy during a medical crisis.

The key factors that support this conclusion are:
- The author is treating court-ordered minimum custody as a ceiling rather than baseline responsibility
- Refusing to attend even one medical appointment that could unlock specialized treatment
- Taking a transactional ""visitor"" approach to parenting rather than acting as a co-parent
- Showing inflexibility during a genuine medical emergency
- Prioritizing personal convenience over the child's urgent medical needs

While the author faces legitimate financial constraints as a college student, these don't excuse abandoning parental duties during a medical crisis. The ex-wife's requests appear reasonable given she's managing primary care and seeking appropriate treatment.

The analysis appropriately rules out other categories - this isn't a case where everyone shares equal blame or where circumstances alone are to blame. One parent is actively blocking access to medical care through deliberate choices.

The Friend, while having legitimate concerns about lending expensive equipment, failed to communicate their reasoning, didn't offer any alternative solutions or compromises, and could have handled the situation with more empathy given it was described as a genuine academic emergency.

The author initiated the conflict by taking Y's property without permission - this was clearly wrong and set everything in motion. However, Y's response was dramatically disproportionate, escalating from a minor property violation to physical violence including pushing, property destruction, and punching. The author then responded with a slap after being punched.

The explanation correctly identifies this as a situation where both parties made significant moral errors:
- The author's initial wrongdoing and failure to de-escalate
- Y's massive overreaction and continued escalation to violence
- Both parties' failure to seek peaceful resolution

This represents a clear case where multiple parties bear moral responsibility. The author's initial violation doesn't excuse Y's violent overreaction, but the author's poor decisions throughout contributed meaningfully to the outcome. Neither party acted as the ""adult in the room"" to prevent escalation.

However, Kylie also contributed meaningfully to the conflict by repeatedly pressing for an opinion she suspected would be negative, then reacting explosively and dismissively when she received it, rather than engaging constructively.

The key distinction here is between ""primary fault"" (which lies with the Author) and ""fault distribution"" (which involves both parties).

The other girl initiated conflict through serious verbal harassment using gendered slurs (""slut"") and made formal accusations that could have academic consequences. This created a hostile environment and represents genuinely harmful behavior.

However, the author is now planning deliberate online harassment/cyberbullying in response, which represents a significant qualitative escalation. Moving from in-person conflict to planned online harassment typically involves broader reach and permanence of harm. The author is also displaying judgmental attitudes and appears to be choosing retaliation over conflict resolution.

This represents a clear case of mutual escalation where both parties are actively choosing increasingly harmful responses rather than de-escalation or seeking appropriate resolution through proper channels. Neither party is blameless - the other girl's initial harassment was serious and harmful, but the author's planned response crosses into cyberbullying territory.

The explanation clearly outlines manipulative and escalatory behavior from the partner, including character attacks, contradictory arguments, and involving the child inappropriately.

- When in relationships this pattern emerges (early vs. later stages)
- What partners initially indicated about their comfort with physical affection
- Whether genuine attempts at compromise were made by either party
- The specific nature of how partners become ""ejective""

These missing details are fundamental to determining fault. For example:
- If the author presents their needs as ultimatums early in relationships, that suggests different fault allocation than if they make vulnerable requests after establishing compatibility
- If partners misrepresent their affection capacity initially, that shifts responsibility toward them
- If this emerges after major relationship changes or stress, it could indicate nobody is truly at fault

The pattern across multiple relationships does suggest systemic issues, but without understanding the specific dynamics, communication styles, and timing involved, I cannot fairly determine whether this represents poor partner selection, communication problems, mismatched expectations, or simply unfortunate incompatibility patterns.

The physical abuse is the most critical element here. Hitting and kicking a partner crosses a clear ethical boundary that cannot be justified by mental health struggles alone. While depression and anxiety deserve compassion, they do not excuse violence against an intimate partner.

The pattern of behavior described - complete refusal to seek treatment despite repeated offers over 12+ months, financial exploitation with no contribution or job, emotional manipulation, and retaliatory behavior - suggests a concerning dynamic that goes beyond mental health challenges into abuse territory.

The author's intervention, while perhaps not perfectly executed, was motivated by witnessing domestic violence. There's a moral obligation to act when someone is being abused, even if the approach could have been more skillful.

The friend (victim) is in a difficult position typical of abuse situations, and holding victims equally responsible for their own victimization would be problematic given the power imbalances inherent in abusive relationships.

The physical violence provides sufficient moral clarity to assign responsibility, despite the complexity of mental health factors involved.

The author violated reasonable rules and showed poor judgment, while the dad responded with massively disproportionate anger, dangerous driving behavior, and abandonment.

The analysis clearly shows that while both bear some responsibility, the fault is heavily skewed toward the dad due to his abusive and dangerous responses that far exceeded any reasonable consequence for minor infractions. The author's mistakes were relatively minor rule violations, while the dad's behavior crossed into potentially abusive territory and endangered lives.

Since both parties contributed to the situation through their poor choices, even though the responsibility is heavily unequal, this fits the ""everybody is at fault"" category.

1. The author had minor fault (20%) for not seeking clarification, but acted with good intentions
2. The family had moderate fault (40%) for unclear communication and harsh reactions
3. Significant systemic issues (40%) including grief-induced communication breakdown and unstated expectations

The assessment notes there's a ""strong argument for NOBODY being at fault"" due to the inevitable nature of grief-related misunderstandings and the lack of malicious intent from anyone involved.

However, the analysis concludes this is ""primarily an EVERYBODY situation"" because there were concrete actions each party could have taken differently, even while acknowledging the mitigating circumstances of grief and good intentions.

The breakdown of specific percentages of fault and the identification of concrete ways each party contributed to the misunderstanding supports the ""Everybody"" classification over ""Nobody,"" despite the strong mitigating factors.

The analysis presents a compelling case for ""Nobody"" by identifying:
- Legitimate competing needs from both parties
- Structural/situational constraints rather than character flaws
- Good faith efforts from both people
- No malicious intent

However, the explanation also acknowledges significant information gaps that ""could change this assessment,"" including:
- Unknown severity of the girlfriend's situation
- Missing pattern information
- Unclear communication history and established expectations

The verdict seems to lean heavily toward ""Nobody"" while simultaneously acknowledging that crucial missing information could shift the assessment toward fault assignment. This creates some tension in the conclusion.

That said, the core reasoning about structural conflicts with legitimate competing needs is sound, and the analysis demonstrates that many relationship conflicts don't require fault assignment. The ""Nobody"" classification appears well-reasoned given the available information, even with the acknowledged uncertainties.

While May could have communicated better about her unavailability, the author's response was disproportionate and crossed multiple lines of appropriate behavior. The analysis correctly identifies that this transformed from a minor scheduling issue into a serious conflict primarily due to the author's choices.

The power dynamic and escalation pattern clearly show the author driving the conflict, while May was responding defensively to increasingly aggressive behavior. Even if May had communicated perfectly, it wouldn't justify the author's boundary violations and abusive conduct.

The husband bears primary responsibility for breaking his dinner commitment without communication and then inappropriately berating his wife when she solved the problem he created. Once he realized around 7 PM that he'd be busy all night, he should have immediately communicated about dinner rather than leaving her waiting until 8:40 PM.

However, the author also contributed significantly through extreme conflict avoidance - waiting over 2 hours without any communication is dysfunctional. Her belief that asking ""How's dinner going?"" would be ""demanding"" shows poor understanding of reasonable communication in a relationship.

Both parties have created a dysfunctional pattern where he makes casual commitments without follow-through and she enables this by never communicating her needs. This isn't just one person's fault - it's a systemic relationship communication problem that both have failed to address.

The 60/40 fault distribution in the explanation accurately reflects that while the husband's actions were more egregious, both parties made clear errors in judgment and communication that led to this conflict.

The girlfriend appears to have fabricated racist accusations against an elderly man to avoid responsibility for what was likely her fault in an accident. The evidence suggests calculated deception - remaining calm until police arrived, then immediately producing tears and specific claims, followed by ""zero remorse"" for the severe consequences imposed on the innocent man. This represents active wrongdoing through false accusations that weaponized race and gender dynamics.

The author bears substantial moral responsibility through his knowing silence. He had direct knowledge that no racist comments occurred, recognized his moral duty in real-time (""say something, just say something""), but chose to remain silent to preserve his relationship. He explicitly acknowledges being ""spineless"" and recognizes his moral failure. His testimony as an independent witness could have prevented the false accusations from being believed.

This situation represents a collaboration in injustice - one person through active deception, the other through enabling silence that was crucial to the deception's success. Both contributed to potentially devastating consequences for an innocent elderly man, though at different levels of responsibility.

The assessment identifies this as primarily a family boundary issue (70% family responsibility) rather than a relationship problem. The key factors supporting this conclusion are:

1. The family is applying traditional gender role expectations to judge a modern relationship
2. They've maintained a sustained campaign of disapproval for a full year
3. They're conflating their personal preferences with actual mistreatment
4. They're undermining the author's adult autonomy in a relationship she describes as happy

The assessment correctly identifies that the author bears some responsibility (20%) for not establishing firm boundaries and considering ending a good relationship due to external pressure rather than addressing the root issue.

The boyfriend's minimal responsibility (10%) also seems appropriate - he shouldn't be required to conform to values neither he nor his girlfriend share.

The analysis appears thorough and well-reasoned. The family is clearly overstepping boundaries by continuously interfering in an adult's relationship based on outdated expectations, while the author has failed to adequately address this interference.

- Whether other long-term partners are typically included
- The legitimacy of space constraints
- The boyfriend's actual advocacy efforts
- The friends' true motivations

These are genuinely important factors that could shift blame considerably. However, I need to consider whether we have enough information to make a reasonable judgment despite these gaps.

The analysis shows that each party has understandable positions:
- The author's hurt feelings after 3 years together are reasonable
- The boyfriend is genuinely caught between competing loyalties
- The friends may have legitimate practical constraints

The framing as a ""systems conflict"" rather than individual fault is insightful - this appears to be a clash between different reasonable expectations rather than clear wrongdoing by any party.

While more information would be helpful, the core dynamic seems clear enough: this is likely an unfortunate situation where established friend group traditions are colliding with relationship progression expectations, without anyone acting unreasonably given their perspective and constraints.

- Created the entire problematic situation

- Failed to clearly communicate expectations while asking the Author not to tell Raoul
- Later deflected responsibility by blaming the Author

However, the Author also bears responsibility by:

The assessment also explicitly rules out the other categories, stating it's ""Not 'Author' or 'Other' alone"" because both contribute significantly to the dysfunction.

The explanation clearly demonstrates a pattern of problematic behavior from the author that goes beyond normal co-parenting concerns.

The key indicators are particularly strong:
- The author's obsessive focus on his ex's appearance (hair, nails, clothes) rather than child welfare
- His dismissive attitude toward legitimate partner concerns
- The defensive framing that immediately questions his girlfriend's readiness to date a parent rather than self-reflecting
- The girlfriend reaching an ultimatum point, suggesting this has been an ongoing, escalating issue

The analysis effectively distinguishes between legitimate co-parenting discussions and what appears to be inappropriate monitoring disguised as parental concern. The author's own words reveal a lack of self-awareness about how his behavior impacts his current relationship.

While there could be some minor responsibility on the girlfriend's part regarding earlier boundary communication, the evidence strongly points to the author as the primary problem. His behavior suggests he's processing divorce trauma and control issues through his romantic relationship rather than addressing them appropriately.
