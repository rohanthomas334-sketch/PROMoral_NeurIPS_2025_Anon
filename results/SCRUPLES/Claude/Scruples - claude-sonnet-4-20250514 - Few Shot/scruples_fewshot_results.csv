The author has endured severe abuse from their father throughout their life, including physical violence and attempts on their life. They're now trapped in an unsafe living situation with a father who has serious cognitive decline and poses safety risks (leaving doors open, forgetting things on stove, etc.). The author's desire for their father to die stems from years of trauma and a desperate need to escape their current circumstances.

While having such thoughts about wanting someone to die is morally concerning, it's an understandable psychological response to prolonged abuse and trauma. The author didn't actively harm their father or refuse to help - they simply felt relief at the possibility of their suffering ending. Their mother is also failing to address the legitimate safety concerns about the father's condition.

However, the specific moment of not helping during a choking incident crosses into more problematic territory, even given the history of abuse. The author's honest self-reflection about their feelings, while disturbing, shows some level of moral awareness.

This is primarily a situation created by years of abuse and the mother's refusal to address serious safety and care issues. The author's response, while morally questionable, is largely a product of trauma and desperation.

It progressed very quickly within months of...,Everybody,Everybody,0.72,0.631578947368421,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the dynamics of communication, expectations, and behavior in an open relationship.

The author is experiencing hurt about their partner having sex with others while declining intimacy with them, despite being in an agreed-upon open relationship. They've also had sex with others, including an ex who was previously ""an issue.""

Key factors:
- Both parties agreed to an open relationship
- Both are having sex with other people
- The author hasn't communicated their feelings about the lack of intimacy between them
- The author is upset about something they're also doing (seeking sex elsewhere)
- Neither partner has been fully transparent about their outside activities

The author acknowledges they might be a ""hypocrite"" and questions whether they have ""ground to stand on."" They're experiencing natural human emotions (hurt, jealousy) but in a context where both partners agreed these activities were acceptable.

The core issue seems to be a lack of communication about needs and expectations within their primary relationship, combined with assumptions and unexpressed hurt feelings. Both partners appear to be operating within the agreed boundaries but failing to address the underlying intimacy issues between them.

This appears to be a situation where both parties are contributing to the problem through poor communication rather than malicious intent.

The author suspected for years that he might be the father of this child but chose not to pursue it directly with the mother. When he encountered the presumed father at a supermarket and that person mentioned the baby doesn't look like him, the author decided to share his suspicions and the timeline that led to them.

While the author's timing and method weren't ideal, he was sharing legitimate concerns based on the timeline and physical resemblance he observed. The mother, however, appears to have been dishonest about the paternity from the beginning - she told the author she wasn't sexually active with the other man, yet became pregnant during their brief relationship, and then publicly claimed the other man was the father without apparently getting a paternity test.

The presumed father is an innocent party who deserved to know if there were questions about paternity. The mother's angry reaction suggests she may have been deliberately concealing the truth rather than genuinely believing in the paternity she claimed.

The core issue stems from the mother's apparent dishonesty about the situation from the beginning, creating a web of deception that was bound to unravel eventually.

The author has been consistent about not wanting children from the beginning - she clearly communicated this to her boyfriend after 6 months of dating, and he agreed at the time. She's not changing her stance or misleading anyone. Not wanting children is a valid personal choice, and she's been honest about it.

The boyfriend initially agreed he didn't want kids either, but after getting a puppy, he appears to have changed his mind and is now making jokes about pregnancy and converting rooms for babies. While people can change their minds about major life decisions, the way he's handling this - through jokes and hints rather than direct conversation - isn't ideal. However, this seems more like poor communication than malicious behavior.

This appears to be a case where two people who were initially compatible have grown in different directions regarding a fundamental life choice. Neither person is inherently wrong for their feelings about having children, and major life changes (like getting a pet) can sometimes shift perspectives in unexpected ways.

The core issue here is a compatibility problem that has developed over time, not anyone being an ""asshole."" Both parties need to have an honest conversation about their current feelings and future plans.

The author admits they:
- Deserved the low grade due to minimal effort
- Made accusations about the teacher ""wanting to fuck"" them based solely on perceived staring
- Threatened to report the teacher to administration when legitimate academic help was offered
- Used these accusations as leverage to extort a grade change

While the teacher's final response of agreeing to raise the grade was inappropriate and unprofessional, the author initiated this entire situation through academic blackmail. The teacher initially responded appropriately by offering legitimate help and explaining he couldn't simply raise an undeserved grade.

The author's perception of ""creepy staring"" may be genuine discomfort, but using unsubstantiated accusations of inappropriate behavior to coerce a grade change crosses a serious ethical line. This could damage the teacher's career and reputation based on what appears to be the author's interpretation rather than concrete inappropriate actions.

The teacher's capitulation was wrong, but the author created this situation through manipulation and threats.

You and your girlfriend explicitly agreed that neither of you would give traditional Valentine's Day gifts. However, you secretly planned to break this agreement while letting her believe she didn't need to get you anything. When you surprised her with flowers, she became upset because you had essentially deceived her about the agreement.

From her perspective, this put her in an uncomfortable position - she had honored the agreement you both made, but you had secretly planned to break it all along. This likely made her feel caught off guard, unprepared, and possibly embarrassed that she didn't have anything for you in return. The ""surprise"" element that you thought would be romantic actually highlighted that you had been dishonest about your intentions.

While your motivation may have been to do something nice, you violated the trust and agreement you had established together.

The author experienced a lack of physical attraction after an intimate encounter, which is a natural human response that can't be controlled. However, the key issue is how they handled the situation afterward.

The author chose to lie about their reasons for ending things, claiming they had ""personal problems"" and weren't ""ready for a relationship"" rather than being honest about the lack of attraction. While this may have been intended to spare the other person's feelings, dishonesty in intimate situations can be hurtful and disrespectful.

That said, there's no indication the other person did anything wrong - they appear to have been a willing participant in a consensual encounter.

The author appears to have genuine expertise - they're a native English speaker with years of experience in English-speaking countries, have completed manuscripts, and are actively working with literary agencies. They've been helping their friend edit and provide feedback over time.

The friend, by contrast, has basic English skills, hasn't finished their manuscript, struggles with plot coherence and language quality, and became unrealistic about their prospects after one friend's overly enthusiastic praise. The friend is planning to submit an unfinished, unedited manuscript written in their non-native language to competitive literary agencies.

The author tried gentle approaches first, explaining industry realities about timing and success rates. Only when pressed did they give more direct feedback about the manuscript's current state and likelihood of acceptance. While this feedback was blunt, it appears to be accurate and professionally informed.

The friend's reaction - calling the author unsupportive and a bad friend - suggests they wanted validation rather than honest assessment. However, sending a friend false encouragement that could lead to professional embarrassment and wasted effort would arguably be less supportive than honest feedback.

The author seems to have balanced honesty with support, continuing to help with editing while providing realistic guidance about the publishing process.

The author had a legitimate concern about someone repeatedly farting in a public space, which is genuinely unpleasant and inconsiderate behavior. However, the way they handled it was quite confrontational - directly telling someone to ""quit farting"" and calling it ""disgusting and fucking rude"" in a public setting is harsh and likely to escalate the situation.

The person farting repeatedly in a crowded bar without any attempt to excuse themselves or move away was being inconsiderate to other patrons. While bodily functions happen, repeatedly doing so without acknowledgment in a social setting shows poor etiquette.

The bartender's reaction seems disproportionate. While she may have been concerned about losing customers, aggressively confronting and ""chewing out"" a patron who had a legitimate complaint (even if poorly expressed) was unprofessional. Her approach of sitting down next to the customer to berate them was inappropriate for someone in a service role.

The author has valid complaints - residential zoning violations, parking issues affecting the neighborhood, and potential safety/licensing concerns are legitimate municipal issues regardless of who raises them. These aren't trivial matters, and residents generally have a right to expect zoning laws to be followed.

However, the author also shows awareness of the sensitive dynamics at play. They acknowledge this is a gentrifying neighborhood, that the business has operated for years with community tolerance, and they're conscious of being newcomers potentially disrupting established informal arrangements.

The key factors that keep this from being clearly the author's fault:
- Zoning violations and unlicensed businesses can pose real safety and legal issues
- Parking problems affect the entire neighborhood, not just them
- They have a legitimate right as residents to expect municipal laws to be followed
- They're genuinely wrestling with the ethical implications rather than acting impulsively

The author is technically meeting their legal obligations by paying court-ordered child support and taking their scheduled visitation. However, when a child develops a serious medical condition like epilepsy, the situation changes significantly. The author is refusing to:

1. Help with mounting medical bills for their child's serious condition
2. Provide any additional childcare to help the mother work and pay these bills
3. Contribute even a small amount to specialized epilepsy camp that would benefit their child's safety and development
4. Meet with doctors for a medical trial that could potentially help their child, citing being ""too busy""
5. Show any flexibility or willingness to help beyond the absolute legal minimum

While the mother has primary custody and the associated responsibilities, both parents have a moral obligation to their child's wellbeing that goes beyond just meeting court minimums, especially when dealing with a serious medical condition that has created extraordinary circumstances.

The author's rigid adherence to ""I only have to do what's legally required"" when their child is suffering from a serious medical condition, combined with their unwillingness to make any accommodations or sacrifices to help their child's health and safety, demonstrates a concerning lack of parental responsibility.

The mother appears to be doing everything possible to care for their child under difficult circumstances and is only asking for reasonable help from the other parent.

The girlfriend is asking for significant favors that would:
- Disrupt the author's sleep schedule (4am airport run)
- Force him to sleep on the couch in his own home
- Potentially disturb his autistic sister's important routine
- Require multiple trips when both women have cars and can drive

The author offered reasonable alternatives (paying for Uber/Lyft) but the girlfriend dismissed this with a vague concern about getting ""hurt"" - which seems unreasonable given that ride-sharing is generally safe and widely used.

The sister's pattern of behavior (complaining, never saying thank you, being generally difficult) adds context but isn't the core issue here.

However, the author's approach seems somewhat confrontational based on the phrasing ""Am i fucking crazy, or am i the asshole here?"" This suggests the argument may have escalated unnecessarily.

That said, the core issue is that the girlfriend is making unreasonable demands that significantly inconvenience the author and potentially his sister, while dismissing practical alternatives he's willing to pay for.

The author has been genuinely helpful to their friend - providing rides, buying food and drinks, and being supportive during difficult times. However, there are some key issues with their behavior:

1. They previously damaged the friend's laptop by throwing something at it, which understandably made the friend protective of their device
2. When denied use of the laptop, they used emotional manipulation by bringing up all their past favors as leverage
3. They stormed out dramatically instead of having a mature conversation
4. They're now giving their friend the silent treatment despite the friend trying to communicate

The friend's hesitation is completely understandable given the previous damage incident. While they could have been more flexible given the emergency nature of the quiz, their initial ""no"" was reasonable self-protection.

The author's reaction - using past favors as emotional leverage, storming out, and then refusing to communicate - shows poor conflict resolution skills and suggests they may have been keeping a mental ""scorecard"" of favors rather than helping out of genuine friendship.

The author is being asked to pay for someone else's trip expenses after already paying their own share back promptly. Having savings doesn't create an obligation to fund other people's vacations, and it's reasonable to feel frustrated about this assumption. However, the author seems to be in a difficult position due to their living arrangement with Judy.

Olivia appears to be putting the author in an uncomfortable position by asking them to cover Judy's expenses, especially after the author already fulfilled their own financial obligation. This creates an awkward dynamic and essentially makes the author feel obligated due to their financial situation.

Judy went on a trip she apparently couldn't afford and hasn't paid back the person who covered for her. While we don't know all the circumstances of why she hasn't paid, going on a trip without being able to pay for it does create problems for others.

The living situation complicates things, but the core issue is about financial boundaries and expectations. The author shouldn't be expected to pay for someone else's vacation just because they have savings, and it's problematic that both Olivia and potentially Judy seem to assume this obligation.

The author deliberately misled their boyfriend about their middle name (claiming it was ""Aimee"" instead of ""May"") across multiple incidents over nearly two years. This wasn't a simple mistake or misunderstanding - it was an intentional, ongoing deception that they planned to continue indefinitely as a ""practical joke."" The author admits to lying three separate times about this.

While a middle name might seem trivial, the issue isn't the significance of the information itself, but rather the pattern of deliberate dishonesty in a committed relationship where they're discussing marriage. Trust is fundamental in relationships, and intentionally deceiving a partner - even about something small - undermines that trust.

The boyfriend's reaction of calling them a liar and being upset is understandable, as he discovered his partner has been deliberately deceiving him for an extended period. His feelings of betrayal are justified.

The author frames this as just a ""bad joke,"" but it was really a sustained deception that they planned to continue indefinitely. The fact that they wanted to drag it out until it became ""awkward for him"" suggests they didn't fully consider how this might affect their partner's trust.

The author describes a clear pattern where:
- A coworker frequently requests time off and shift coverage
- The author regularly covers shifts with promises of reciprocal help that never materialize
- The author cannot get their own time off requests approved due to the coworker's frequent absences
- The author has only called out once (for illness) while consistently helping others
- The author is working nearly full-time hours (30+ per week) partly due to covering for others

The author is simply expressing frustration about an unfair work dynamic and asking if their feelings are justified. They're not describing taking any retaliatory action or being unreasonable in their expectations. Wanting reciprocity in shift coverage and being able to occasionally take time off are reasonable workplace expectations.

The coworker appears to be taking advantage of others' willingness to help without reciprocating, and management seems to be enabling this by not ensuring fair coverage policies.

The author had legitimate concerns about their friend's relationship - the rapid timeline, potential financial imbalances, and what they perceived as taking advantage. However, the key issues are:

1. **Timing and delivery**: The author chose to express these concerns only after being directly pressed about their lack of response to the engagement announcement. This created a confrontational situation at what should have been a happy moment.

2. **Approach**: Rather than having a thoughtful, private conversation earlier in the relationship when concerns first arose, the author ""bit their tongue"" and then delivered all their criticisms at once in a heated moment.

3. **Ultimatum**: Declaring they won't attend the wedding was an extreme response that forced their friend into a defensive position.

4. **Friend's reaction**: While the friend became defensive and angry, this is understandable given that their best friend just criticized their relationship and refused to support their engagement.

The author's concerns may have been valid, but their method of expressing them was poorly timed and delivered in a way that was more likely to damage the friendship than help their friend.

The author describes having ""Skin Hunger,"" a legitimate need for non-sexual physical affection that affects their mental and emotional wellbeing. They're asking for basic intimate connection - cuddling and holding - which is a reasonable expectation in romantic relationships for many people.

The key factors here:
- The author has a genuine need they're communicating clearly
- They're asking for normal relationship intimacy (cuddling, physical affection)
- They're not demanding anything unreasonable or inappropriate
- Multiple partners have rejected these basic intimacy needs

However, the author uses the word ""insisting"" which could suggest they're being pushy about it. But even so, physical affection is a fundamental aspect of most romantic relationships, and it's reasonable to expect some level of it from a romantic partner.

The pattern suggests the author may be incompatible with partners who don't value physical affection, but that doesn't make either party at fault - it's just incompatibility. The author isn't wrong for having these needs, and partners aren't necessarily wrong for not wanting to meet them, though repeatedly entering relationships without being willing to provide basic physical intimacy could be problematic.

Given that the author is asking for reasonable relationship expectations and communicating their needs clearly, while their partners seem unwilling to provide basic romantic intimacy, this appears to be more about incompatibility than fault.

The author was clear about their boundaries from the start - they explicitly told Joseph they didn't want to pursue anything because they were happy with Toni, and warned Joseph not to ""hold out"" for them. However, the author continued to engage in conversations about ""what could've been"" and met up alone with Joseph despite knowing he still had feelings. When Joseph began escalating physical contact (arm around, holding hands), the author recognized these as ""red flags"" but didn't remove themselves from the situation until after the kiss occurred.

Joseph's behavior is more problematic. Despite the author's clear statements about not wanting to pursue anything, he continued to express hope they'd get together someday and escalated physical contact without clear consent. The kiss was particularly inappropriate given the established boundaries. His pattern of behavior (mentioned history of relationship issues) suggests this wasn't an isolated incident of poor judgment.

While the author made some questionable choices in continuing the friendship and not leaving when boundaries were being crossed, Joseph bears primary responsibility for deliberately ignoring clearly stated boundaries and initiating unwanted physical contact.

The author shares some fault for not being more decisive in maintaining boundaries, but Joseph's actions were the primary violation here.

The author called in sick for one day due to legitimate medical issues (ovarian cyst pain and medication side effects). They communicated promptly with their boss about their absence. However, when asked for a doctor's note, they're considering not providing one because they didn't actually see a doctor and claim they haven't seen this requirement in company policy.

The boss is within reasonable management rights to request documentation for sick leave, especially in a healthcare setting where reliability is crucial. Many workplaces have policies requiring doctor's notes for sick days, even if not explicitly stated or well-communicated.

The author's reasoning for potentially refusing seems problematic - they're focusing on technicalities (policy not clearly stated, didn't see a doctor) rather than working constructively with their employer. In a professional healthcare environment, this approach could damage their working relationship and credibility.

While the boss could have been clearer about policies upfront, requesting documentation for sick leave is standard practice. The author should either obtain the requested documentation or have an honest conversation with their boss about the situation rather than simply refusing.

The girlfriend appears to be struggling with legitimate mental health issues (anxiety and depression), but after over a year, she has made no concrete steps toward treatment despite offers of help. More concerning are the reports of physical abuse (hitting and kicking her boyfriend) and the manipulative behavior of turning others against the author when confronted about the situation.

The boyfriend seems to be enabling this behavior by continuing to provide complete care without setting boundaries or requiring progress toward treatment or independence.

The author expressed genuine concern for their friend's wellbeing and offered constructive help (offering to call and accompany her to appointments). When that was declined and no progress was made over many months, expressing concern about the unhealthy dynamic was reasonable, especially given the reported abuse.

While mental illness is serious and deserves compassion, it doesn't excuse abusive behavior or justify indefinite dependence without any effort toward improvement. The author's comparison to their own experience with serious mental illness (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) and taking responsibility for their recovery provides important context.

The girlfriend's hostile reaction and attempt to turn others against the author when confronted suggests defensive behavior rather than genuine engagement with the concerns raised.

The girlfriend's father's behavior was clearly problematic - he was controlling about the drink choice, forbade eating in the truck despite the author being hungry after hours of physical labor, and had an explosive, disproportionate reaction that included profanity, throwing food out the window, and abandoning someone on the side of the road. This behavior was abusive and unacceptable.

However, the author also made a poor decision. After being explicitly told not to eat in the truck, he chose to disobey this instruction by sneaking food. While the rule seemed unreasonable and the author was understandably hungry, he knew he was going against a direct instruction. This act of defiance, while minor, directly contributed to the escalation when he was caught.

The father's reaction was wildly disproportionate to the offense, but the author's decision to sneak food when explicitly told not to did play a causal role in triggering the incident. Both parties made poor choices that contributed to this conflict.

I haven't changed...",Other,Nobody,0.75,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider whether there was genuine wrongdoing versus a miscommunication during a difficult time.

The author experienced a death in the family and received instructions from their mother about social media. They interpreted ""don't post anything on social media"" to mean specifically about the grandfather, not a complete social media blackout. This seems like a reasonable interpretation - the instruction was ambiguous.

The author's action (updating profile pictures after years of not changing them) was coincidental timing and had no malicious intent. They weren't celebrating or being disrespectful - just doing routine social media maintenance they'd been putting off.

The family's reaction, while understandable given their grief, seems disproportionate. Different people have different views on appropriate mourning behavior, but expecting someone to completely cease all social media activity isn't a universal standard. The author immediately apologized when they understood the family's expectations.

This appears to be a genuine misunderstanding during an emotionally charged time. The author acted reasonably based on their interpretation of ambiguous instructions, showed no disrespect, and apologized when the miscommunication became clear.

The author:
- Offered to call later that night instead of immediately
- Was honest about needing to study and complete projects
- Shows genuine care and guilt about his girlfriend's situation
- Recognizes the difficulty of balancing relationship needs with academic responsibilities
- Is trying to maintain both his education and his relationship

The girlfriend:
- Had a legitimately bad day and needed support
- Appears to be isolated with limited support system
- Her need for comfort was genuine and understandable

This appears to be a normal relationship challenge where two legitimate needs (academic success and emotional support) came into conflict. The author didn't refuse to talk entirely - he proposed a compromise by offering to call later. College students need to maintain their studies, and offering to connect later the same day seems like a reasonable middle ground.

Neither person appears to have acted unreasonably or selfishly. This is more about unfortunate timing and the natural tensions that arise in long-distance relationships between high school and college students at different life stages.

The author's perspective has some validity - they gave advance notice, coordinated with multiple people, and were frustrated when someone backed out at the last minute without explanation for what seemed like a casual reason (""can't be bothered""). The disruption to a group project is understandable cause for frustration.

However, the author's response was problematic in several ways:
- Became pushy and physically took someone's shoe when they said no
- Called the person a ""little shit"" when they continued to decline
- Publicly blamed them to the rest of the group
- Gossiped about the situation to others later

The key issue is that ""no"" should be sufficient - people don't owe detailed explanations for why they can't or don't want to participate in voluntary activities, even if it's inconvenient. The fact that May had personal issues at home that others knew about suggests there may have been valid reasons she couldn't articulate in the moment.

The teenager is expressing a natural developmental need for independence and peer relationships, which is completely normal at 15. They're not being disrespectful or hurtful - just honest about their preference to see the movie with friends instead of their dad.

The father wanting to spend time with his teenager is also completely understandable and shows he cares about maintaining their relationship. There's nothing wrong with a parent wanting to share an activity they think they'd both enjoy.

This appears to be a normal family situation where two people have different but equally valid preferences. The teenager isn't being unreasonable for wanting independence, and the dad isn't wrong for wanting to spend time together. Neither party is acting inappropriately or causing harm - this is just a typical generational difference that many families navigate.

The author made a significant mistake by telling his friend he had romantic feelings when he didn't genuinely feel that way. Even under pressure, claiming to have a crush on someone when you don't is misleading and hurtful. However, his actions seem to stem from months of relentless pressure rather than malicious intent, and he did try to be honest about his confusion and ultimately told the truth.

The friend and the broader social circle created an extremely problematic situation by pressuring someone for months about their romantic feelings. This kind of sustained pressure about personal, intimate matters is inappropriate and manipulative. The friend's reaction - calling him ""mentally weak"" after he was honest about his feelings - shows a lack of understanding about the pressure campaign she and others orchestrated.

While the author bears responsibility for his dishonesty, the root cause was the inappropriate and sustained pressure from others who wouldn't accept ""no"" as an answer and kept pushing until they got the response they wanted.

The girlfriend initially did something wrong by reorganizing the author's room without permission a month ago, which is inconsiderate. However, she did attempt to apologize, even if the apologies included justifications (""sorry but..."").

The author's response seems disproportionate and controlling. Key problematic behaviors include:
- Demanding multiple apologies for the same incident
- Calling her back specifically to criticize how she apologized
- Making her come upstairs to apologize again
- Refusing to accept her attempts at making amends (offering to reorganize)
- Continuing to escalate the conflict over the ""perfect"" apology

While the girlfriend's initial action was wrong and her later name-calling was inappropriate, the author's behavior of repeatedly demanding apologies and controlling how she should express remorse is more problematic.

The friend appears to be exploring their gender expression and identity, which can be a confusing and experimental process. While their behavior might seem performative or attention-seeking, this could be part of genuine self-discovery. However, their actions are also making the author uncomfortable - particularly the loud sexual comments in class and the repetitive phrases that interrupt normal conversation.

The author's frustration seems understandable given the disruptive behavior, but telling someone they ""make the LGBT community look bad"" would be harmful and inappropriate. This kind of statement reinforces negative stereotypes and suggests there's a ""right"" way to be LGBT. It could also damage someone who might be genuinely questioning their identity.

The friend's behavior in class (loud sexual comments) and ignoring the author during conversations shows some inconsideration, but this appears to stem from their current phase of self-exploration rather than malicious intent.

Both parties have some fault here - the friend for inconsiderate behavior that makes others uncomfortable, and the author for considering such a hurtful response. However, the author's proposed reaction would be significantly more harmful than the friend's awkward behavior.

However, he became completely absorbed in his hobby and lost track of time/responsibility. When the author took initiative to solve the dinner problem at 8:40 PM (well past any reasonable dinner time), the husband berated them for not demanding he follow through.

The author was trying to be considerate by not interrupting someone enjoying their hobby, but the husband argues this was poor communication. However, the husband had already made a commitment and failed to follow through, then blamed the author for not being more demanding.

While there could have been clearer communication about timing expectations, the primary fault lies with the husband for:

The wife made a commitment not to talk to someone she had developed serious feelings for, but then broke that promise by resuming contact. This represents a breach of trust and agreement in the marriage.

The husband, feeling betrayed by this broken promise, took unilateral action by blocking the other person's number without discussing it with his wife first. While his frustration is understandable, blocking someone's contact without the wife's knowledge is a controlling action that bypasses communication and mutual decision-making in the relationship.

Both parties have contributed to this problematic dynamic - the wife through deception and broken promises, and the husband through secretive controlling behavior rather than direct confrontation of the issue.

Unfortunately, she happen...",Author,Author,0.72,0.6829268292682927,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives and actions of both parties.

The author is grappling with a genuinely difficult decision about having biological children due to concerns about passing on a heritable autoimmune disease. Their concern for potential children's wellbeing is understandable, and they're not abandoning their partner over this issue. However, there are some problematic aspects to their approach:

1. They seem to have made this decision unilaterally (""When I made it clear that it'd be better if we wouldn't have children"") rather than having an ongoing discussion with their partner
2. They rejected adoption as an alternative while still wanting children to be ""related,"" which seems inconsistent with their stated concern about children's wellbeing
3. The framing suggests they view their partner's condition as inherently disqualifying without fully exploring options like genetic counseling

The partner's upset reaction is completely understandable given that having children was described as ""one of our biggest dreams"" for both of them, and they're essentially being told their genetics make them unsuitable for biological parenthood.

However, this appears to be more of a tragic situation involving two people with legitimate but incompatible needs rather than someone being clearly at fault. The author isn't malicious, just struggling with a complex ethical dilemma, albeit handling it imperfectly.

About a month into the r...",Other,Other,0.75,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives and actions of both parties.

The author's position seems reasonable - wanting to take time to establish practical foundations like living together, saving money, and planning a proper wedding after only 4 months of dating shows maturity and thoughtfulness. His desire to give his girlfriend ""the wedding she deserves"" demonstrates care and consideration.

The girlfriend's behavior is more concerning. Pushing for immediate marriage after just one month of dating, then again at 4 months, and giving the silent treatment when her partner expresses reasonable concerns about timing shows impatience and potentially manipulative behavior. While it's understandable to be excited about the relationship, pressuring someone into such a major life decision so quickly and then withdrawing communication when they don't comply is problematic.

The author has consistently communicated his feelings (love, desire for marriage) while also expressing legitimate practical concerns. He hasn't been dismissive of marriage itself, just the rushed timeline. The girlfriend's response of not talking to him after he maintained his reasonable position suggests she may be trying to pressure him through emotional manipulation.

The author is clearly dealing with legitimate concerns about his children's welfare and the frustrations that come with limited custody and co-parenting conflicts. These are real issues that affect his life significantly. However, there are several problematic aspects to his behavior:

1. He admits to talking about his ex ""a fair bit"" - suggesting this is a frequent topic of conversation
2. He's making assumptions and judgments about his ex's spending based on superficial observations (her appearance vs. the kids' clothes)
3. He's essentially asking his girlfriend to serve as a sounding board for ongoing complaints about his ex-wife
4. He seems to expect his girlfriend to always agree with his perspective

The girlfriend's frustration appears justified. While supporting a partner through co-parenting challenges is reasonable, constantly hearing complaints and criticisms about an ex can be emotionally draining and create an uncomfortable dynamic. Her request to stop these conversations, while perhaps delivered as an ultimatum, seems like a boundary she needs to set for her own well-being.

The author's expectation that discussing his ex ""is really par for the course for anyone dating a parent"" shows some lack of awareness about healthy relationship boundaries. There's a difference between occasional venting and making someone a regular audience for grievances about an ex.

I reached over and ...",Author,Everybody,0.72,0.7777777777777778,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the actions and reactions of both parties.

The author made two key mistakes: first, he interfered with his sister's social media account without permission, which could have created an awkward situation with someone she has romantic interest in. Even though the like was quickly removed, this kind of digital interaction can be embarrassing and potentially damaging to someone's romantic prospects. Second, and perhaps more importantly, when his sister expressed that she was upset, he dismissed her feelings by telling her she was ""overreacting"" rather than acknowledging her concerns and apologizing immediately.

However, the sister's response also seems disproportionate. While her initial anger was understandable, continuing to berate him days later and involving friends to validate her position suggests she's escalating the conflict beyond what the original transgression warranted. A harmless prank that was immediately undone, while inconsiderate, doesn't typically merit this level of ongoing anger.

The author did eventually apologize, showing some recognition that his actions were wrong. The sister's refusal to accept the apology and her continued anger days later, along with rallying friends against him, suggests she's also contributing to the conflict's escalation.

Both parties handled this poorly - the author through his initial thoughtless action and dismissive response, and the sister through her prolonged anger and refusal to move forward after receiving an apology.

She said we were...",Author,Author,0.85,0.9,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the ethics and consent issues around intimate images after a breakup.

The key issue here is consent. When intimate images are shared in a relationship, the consent is typically understood to be for the duration of that relationship and for the specific context of that intimate partnership. Once the relationship ends, the reasonable expectation is that such images would be deleted out of respect for the other person's privacy and dignity.

The author's reasoning that ""she'd already seen me naked"" misses the fundamental point about ongoing consent. Just because someone consented to intimate images during a relationship doesn't mean that consent extends indefinitely after the relationship ends. The ex-girlfriend has clearly withdrawn her consent for him to possess these images.

While the author states he won't share or use the images for blackmail, keeping them against her explicit wishes is still problematic. It violates her reasonable expectation of privacy and shows a lack of respect for her boundaries. The fact that he's keeping them ""for his own continued enjoyment"" when she's explicitly asked him to delete them is concerning.

The author seems to genuinely not understand why this is wrong, but his lack of malicious intent doesn't make his actions appropriate. When someone asks for intimate images to be deleted after a relationship ends, the respectful thing to do is comply with that request.

The author is dealing with a rescued dog with behavioral issues and is trying to help the dog adjust properly. They're clearly concerned about their pet's wellbeing and training progress. However, they brought their dog (which they know has aggression issues when frustrated or overwhelmed) into a social situation without properly managing the interaction or speaking up when problems arose.

The cousin with Down syndrome is being overly rough and persistent with the dog, not respecting the animal's need for space and rest. However, they may not fully understand appropriate boundaries with animals due to their developmental disability.

The boyfriend and other family members present seem to be allowing this problematic interaction to continue without intervening, despite presumably knowing about both the dog's issues and their cousin's tendency to be overly enthusiastic with pets.

Everyone shares some responsibility here: the author for not managing the situation or advocating for their dog, the family for not supervising the interaction appropriately, and while the cousin's actions are problematic, their disability is a significant mitigating factor in terms of fault assignment.

The author had the primary responsibility to protect their dog and manage the situation, but others also failed to help create a safe environment.

The author clearly expressed their strong interest in this person from the very beginning and repeatedly communicated how much it hurt them when their friend continued to engage with him. The friend initially claimed she wasn't interested, then added him on social media despite the author's expressed discomfort, continued talking to him after being told it was hurtful, and eventually developed feelings for him.

However, the author also tried to control their friend's actions and relationships, essentially demanding they choose between a potential romantic interest and their friendship. While the author's feelings are understandable, attempting to dictate who someone can talk to or be interested in crosses boundaries.

The friend was dishonest about their feelings initially and continued actions they knew were hurting their best friend. They could have been more upfront about their developing interest or respected the author's feelings given how clearly they were communicated.

Both parties made mistakes - the author by trying to control their friend's choices, and the friend by being dishonest and disregarding their friend's clearly expressed feelings. This created an inevitable conflict where someone would get hurt.

While you're legally not obligated to pay since you're not on the lease, there are important moral considerations here:

1. You both made a mutual decision to move in together and split costs
2. You both benefited from the arrangement while together
3. The breakup wasn't due to any wrongdoing mentioned - just a relationship ending
4. Your ex now faces unexpected financial hardship through no fault of her own
5. You have the means to help (your mom mentions you can afford it) and are getting financial relief by moving home rent-free

Your mother's advice, while legally correct, seems to ignore the moral dimension. Calling your ex ""nothing more than a friend"" and emphasizing she has resources doesn't change that you both entered this housing commitment together in good faith.

The fact that you're ""willing to pay"" suggests your conscience is telling you the right thing to do. Leaving someone in financial hardship when you have the ability to honor your original commitment, especially when the situation arose from a mutual life decision gone wrong, would be morally questionable.

The author made a comment about their coworker's weight (""put all your 95 pounds into it"") which, while potentially meant as light workplace banter, was still a comment about someone's physical appearance. However, the coworker's response (""I may only be 95 pounds, but I'm stronger than your fat ass will ever be"") was significantly more aggressive and personal, escalating from a potentially playful jab to a direct insult.

The key factors here are:
1. The author's comment, while inappropriate, seems to have been made in the context of encouraging effort on a work task
2. The coworker's response was disproportionately harsh and deliberately hurtful

The father established exercise requirements tied to CAP participation, which is reasonable parenting. However, his approach becomes problematic in several ways:

1. He dismissed the author's actual workout when weather conditions weren't suitable for running, despite the author communicating proactively and following through with alternative exercise
2. He moved goalposts by suddenly requiring cardio specifically after initially seeming satisfied
3. His communication style included minimizing the author's progress, making cutting remarks, and using intimidation tactics
4. He escalated to name-calling (""immature, petty, and not worth talking to like an adult"") when challenged
5. His statement about not caring about ""why"" they obey, only ""that"" they obey, suggests an authoritarian rather than developmental approach to parenting

- Communicated proactively about weather conditions
- Did complete a workout as alternative to running
- Attempted to engage in reasoned discussion about natural consequences and self-discipline
- Made a logical observation about contradictory statements
- Showed emotional response (crying) which is normal for a 15-year-old in a heated discussion

The accusation of ""gaslighting"" appears misplaced - the author was pointing out an apparent contradiction in statements, which is legitimate in discussion. The father's reaction suggests he may have felt challenged in his authority rather than actually being manipulated.

While the author could have handled some aspects better, the primary issues stem from the father's communication style and approach to conflict resolution.

The mother-in-law made a critical error by placing a 10-week-old puppy on the ground near a French bulldog with known severe food aggression, especially with food present. This was the direct cause of the attack. Her subsequent behavior at the vet was also problematic - making the situation about family dynamics rather than taking responsibility, performing for staff, and minimizing the author's legitimate concerns.

The sister-in-law owns a dog with known severe food aggression issues and hasn't provided a proper apology for her dog's attack. The girlfriend's ""apology"" was worded in a way that seemed to blame the author for being upset.

The author's response appears entirely reasonable - they're angry about their puppy nearly dying due to others' negligence, they're setting appropriate boundaries (not allowing the puppy near the aggressive dog again, declining babysitting from someone who put their pet in danger), and they're seeking acknowledgment and apologies for what happened.

The author calling the French bulldog a ""monster"" after it nearly killed their puppy is an understandable emotional response, not an asshole behavior. Their anger and boundary-setting are justified given the circumstances and the lack of accountability from the other parties.

The author is 21 and moving back temporarily while preparing to move abroad. The mother wants to know his bank balance to determine if he can contribute money beyond groceries. The author plans to hide his money in cash to avoid these requests.

Key considerations:
- The author is an adult (21) with a right to financial privacy
- He's willing to contribute reasonably (groceries, etc.) 
- The mother appears to want access to his savings beyond reasonable living contributions
- This is a temporary arrangement before he moves abroad
- Hiding money in cash to avoid unreasonable financial demands is a defensive measure

While the deception isn't ideal, the mother seems to be overstepping boundaries by wanting to know his full financial situation and expecting ""chunks"" of his savings rather than just reasonable contributions for living expenses. An adult child living temporarily with parents should contribute fairly to household costs, but parents aren't entitled to their adult child's entire financial picture or savings, especially when those savings are needed for the child's future plans.

The author made an initial comment about their friend not eating much, which could be seen as insensitive - commenting on someone's eating habits can make people uncomfortable. However, this seems to have been intended as light-hearted concern rather than criticism.

The friend's response was significantly more problematic. She launched into a lengthy critique calling the author's normal eating habits ""gross,"" claiming three meals a day is ""way too much,"" and essentially calling the author a glutton.

When the author defended herself by pointing out the inconsistency (if she supposedly overeats, why is she smaller?), this was a direct but understandable response to being attacked about her eating and body.

The friend has been consistently benefiting from the author's generosity and hospitality, yet responded to a mild comment with harsh judgment about the author's eating habits and body. The author's defensive response, while not ideal, was provoked by the friend's much more severe criticism.

The author heard rumors from multiple classmates about his girlfriend kissing another person during a school trip. While he wasn't 100% certain, he had heard this from several sources. In a relationship, it's reasonable to address concerns about potential infidelity, especially when multiple people are reporting the same thing.

The way he approached the confrontation was actually quite measured - he gave her an opportunity to volunteer information first (""Do you have anything to say to me?"") rather than immediately accusing her. When she didn't respond, he asked directly about what happened during the trip, and only brought up the specific rumor when she gave an incomplete answer.

The girlfriend's reaction, while understandable given that she was innocent, doesn't make the author wrong for bringing up his concerns. In healthy relationships, partners should be able to discuss worries and rumors, even if they turn out to be false.

The author shows remorse about the situation and is asking for advice on how to handle it, which suggests he recognizes the difficulty of the situation but was trying to address legitimate relationship concerns.

The complete lack of reciprocity from people who regularly benefit from the author's thoughtfulness shows a concerning lack of consideration.

While the author could have communicated their needs more clearly, their hurt feelings and desire for basic recognition on their birthday are entirely reasonable. The fault lies primarily with family members who have failed to show even minimal care and attention.

Let me explain her for a second, shes got a past so bad, tha...",Other,Nobody,0.72,0.8238993710691824,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider both perspectives carefully.

The author is dealing with a partner who has experienced severe trauma - domestic abuse, sexual assault, death of parents, suicide attempts, and ongoing mental health struggles. The partner appears to be responding to the author's positive comments by immediately countering with her own traumatic experiences or current struggles.

While the author's frustration is understandable (constantly having positive moments deflated can be emotionally draining), the partner's behavior seems to stem from genuine trauma and possibly poor coping mechanisms rather than malicious intent. People with severe trauma often struggle with others' happiness because it highlights their own pain, or they may not know how to engage in conversations without referencing their experiences.

The author shows some empathy by acknowledging they usually comfort their partner and don't blame them for their past. However, getting ""visibly annoyed"" and internally dismissing their partner's grief (""I think I get it your mom is dead"") suggests a lack of understanding about how grief and trauma work.

The partner isn't necessarily wrong for struggling with holidays or having difficulty when others express joy - these are common trauma responses. However, consistently deflating every positive moment the author shares isn't healthy communication.

This seems like a situation where both people need better communication skills and possibly professional help, but neither is acting with malicious intent.

The pact was made during a moment of stress and fear in junior year when both friends felt overwhelmed and hopeless about their academic prospects. It was essentially a mutual support agreement born out of anxiety rather than a carefully considered life decision.

However, circumstances changed significantly - the author improved academically and earned admission to their dream school, while the friend's situation remained difficult. The original promise was made under different circumstances and was based on both students being in similar academic positions.

While breaking a promise is generally problematic, this particular promise would require the author to sacrifice a major life opportunity and years of hard work. The friend's anger is understandable given his disappointment and feeling left behind, but expecting someone to give up their dream school to honor a pact made during a low point seems unreasonable.

The author shows genuine care for their friend and guilt about the situation, indicating they didn't make this decision lightly or with malicious intent. They're trying to balance honoring their commitment with pursuing their future.

This appears to be a case where changed circumstances make the original agreement impractical and potentially harmful to follow through on.

The husband made a reasonable effort to get the correct order by reading directly from the message, and he has the receipt showing the special order was placed correctly. The restaurant error appears genuine, and while he's made one mistake before, that doesn't seem to be the case here. However, when his wife asked him to return to fix the error, he refused due to being tired, despite her saying she would do the same for him.

The wife's initial disappointment about the wrong order is understandable, especially since they don't order takeout often due to financial constraints. However, her reaction escalated the situation significantly - getting ""very upset,"" demanding he return to the restaurant, and engaging in shouting when he declined. The order did contain 50% of what she wanted, and there was an offer to share his food as well.

Both parties contributed to turning a minor restaurant error into a major argument that ruined their evening. The husband could have been more accommodating about returning to fix the error, while the wife could have handled the disappointment more proportionally given the circumstances were largely out of their control.

The girlfriend's responses were unnecessarily harsh and escalatory. When the author suggested picking up an item she had mentioned, her correction about not ""wanting"" it but just saying she ""could get it"" was overly pedantic. More importantly, her response ""I DONT WANT TO GO, so i don't need your dots ty"" was disproportionately aggressive to what was clearly meant as a casual suggestion followed by an understanding response.

However, the author also contributed to the escalation. The ellipsis (""..."") in ""okie, it was just a suggestion..."" can reasonably be interpreted as passive-aggressive, suggesting annoyance or disappointment. When she called this out and he responded with just ""ok."" - another potentially passive-aggressive response - he further inflamed the situation instead of addressing her concern directly.

The girlfriend then overreacted by continuing to press the issue and making it about her right to make statements without them ""turning into a fight,"" when the author's initial responses, while perhaps passive-aggressive, were relatively mild.

Both parties failed to communicate clearly and constructively. The girlfriend was overly aggressive and confrontational, while the author used passive-aggressive responses that reasonably upset her, even if unintentionally.

The key facts are:
- The author is a stay-at-home parent by mutual agreement
- All bills and expenses run through the author's account
- The husband reduced his contribution from 80% to 45-50% of his paycheck
- The husband kept the extra money for himself but still expects all bills to be paid
- Bills are now going unpaid and the account is going negative

This appears to be a case where the husband unilaterally changed a working financial arrangement without adjusting responsibilities accordingly. He's keeping more money while still expecting the same level of financial management from his partner, which has created an impossible situation where there simply isn't enough money to cover the bills.

The author's request for more money isn't about wanting extra spending money - it's about having enough to cover basic household expenses that both parties benefit from. The husband's expectation that bills continue to be paid while providing insufficient funds is unreasonable.

The author is not at fault for requesting adequate funds to manage the household finances they're responsible for.

The author acknowledges he didn't mean to physically bump her and that he was struggling mentally, but he still chose to handle his frustration poorly by being aggressive and condescending. The girlfriend, while understandably upset, escalated the conflict by screaming at him publicly.

- Agreed to meet when S requested further discussion

- Acts selfishly and manipulatively
- Creates situations that negatively impact the author's life
- Recently allowed someone who ""hates"" the author to move in, making the author feel unsafe

A decade-long friendship does carry weight, but the author seems to have given this relationship considerable patience and effort. The friend's dismissive response to safety concerns and continued pattern of creating drama that affects others suggests they are not being a good friend. The author recognizing this as feeling like ""an abusive relationship"" indicates they've reached an unhealthy dynamic.

The key facts are:
- No planning was done beforehand about sleeping arrangements
- The author brought their own bed frame and mattress
- The roommates bought a bunk bed together with their own mattresses
- Everyone agrees solo sleeping is the best arrangement
- The author is considering refusing to rotate or give up their solo spot

The author has legitimate reasons for wanting to keep their solo arrangement - they own their bed frame, they're a restless sleeper, and there are practical/hygiene concerns about sharing beds. Since no prior agreement was made about rotating sleeping arrangements, and the author invested in their own furniture, they have a reasonable claim to keep using what they own.

The roommates aren't necessarily wrong for bringing up the topic of switching, as it's natural they'd want the better sleeping arrangement too. However, they chose to buy a bunk bed together, which was their decision.

Your father, as the host at his own holiday home, made a polite request for you to move seats. While you had been sitting there for an hour, this doesn't create an ownership claim over that particular spot. When he asked you to move, the appropriate response would have been to simply accommodate his request - especially since there were other available seats, including one next to your mother.

Instead, you chose to dig in and refuse, essentially forcing a confrontation over something relatively minor. Your reasoning that ""his reasoning is the same as mine"" misses the key point that he's the host and homeowner. The threat to leave if you couldn't sit in that exact spot seems disproportionate to the situation.

Your father's escalation to threatening anger wasn't ideal, but it came after you had already refused his initial polite request. The fact that the rest of your family convinced you to move suggests they also felt you were being unreasonable.

The author is facing a genuine ethical dilemma between loyalty to their spouse and concern for an innocent person being deceived. While the desire to help Brooke comes from a place of empathy and personal experience with infidelity, the author would be violating their husband's trust and potentially damaging their marriage by revealing information shared in confidence.

The husband is in a difficult position too - he received this information in confidence from a coworker and is trying to maintain appropriate boundaries between his work relationships and personal life. His warning about trust isn't unreasonable given that he explicitly shared this as confidential information.

Scott is clearly the primary wrongdoer here - he's the one actively deceiving his wife, continuing an affair after promising to end it, and inappropriately sharing intimate details with coworkers.

However, the author is only ""considering"" telling Brooke, not actually doing it yet. The internal struggle and desire to help someone being wronged, while potentially misguided in execution, comes from understandable moral concern rather than malicious intent.

The author made a joke saying ""That's why women don't belong in the gym"" in what he describes as a ""goofy voice"" to indicate it wasn't serious. However, several factors make this problematic:

1. The joke reinforced a harmful stereotype, even if meant sarcastically

The author and boyfriend were upfront about not being tidy people in their rental posting, and the roommate agreed to this arrangement. However, there seems to be a disconnect between what was communicated and what's actually happening.

The author admits they ""let the kitchen get messier than usual"" after the roommate moved in, which suggests they may have exceeded even their own stated standards. When the roommate first addressed this politely, they responded appropriately by cleaning up and being more mindful.

However, the roommate's subsequent behavior - passive-aggressively cleaning while complaining about being tired, making pointed comments about having to clean ""their"" mess, and repeatedly bringing up cleanliness issues - suggests she's not actually okay with the living arrangement she agreed to.

1. Overstepping significant boundaries regarding deeply personal reproductive choices
2. Disrespectful of their established religious beliefs
3. Likely to cause family conflict without changing the outcome
4. Potentially damaging to family relationships

The brother and sister-in-law, while making a choice that carries significant risks, are making an informed decision based on their values and beliefs. They have the right to make reproductive choices according to their own moral framework, even if others disagree with those choices.

This appears to be a situation where the author would be at fault for interfering in such a personal matter, despite their good intentions.

The author admits to making jokes about their friend being poor, including saying ""you smell like poor!"" The author acknowledges they usually only make such jokes when they're sure the other person knows it's a joke, but they made these jokes anyway. The friend was hurt enough to cry about it, which led to the friend's mom calling the author's grandmother.

While the author may not have intended to cause serious harm, they crossed a line by making jokes about poverty (a sensitive topic) without being certain their friend would understand it as humor. The fact that the friend cried shows these weren't received as harmless jokes. The author also admits they deviated from their usual practice of ensuring the other person knows it's a joke.

The friend's emotional response seems genuine and proportionate to being mocked about something as sensitive as economic status. There's no indication the friend overreacted or contributed to the problem.

The author made a comment calling someone wearing an abortion rights bandana a ""killerbaby bandito"" - referencing Twenty One Pilots while the person was advocating for abortion rights. Even though the author claims this was just a band reference, the timing and word choice (""killerbaby"") in the context of abortion rights activism was extremely insensitive and hurtful.

The author seems genuinely confused about why their friend is upset, which suggests a lack of awareness about how their comment could be interpreted as mocking or trivializing an important social justice issue. However, when someone is advocating for reproductive rights, making a joke that includes the word ""killer"" + ""baby"" is bound to be offensive, regardless of intent.

The friend's reaction - blocking and calling them names - while understandable given the hurt caused, was also quite harsh, especially if they believed this was an innocent mistake by someone who didn't understand the impact of their words.

Both parties contributed to this conflict - the author through insensitive timing and word choice, and the friend through an unwillingness to communicate about the misunderstanding.

The author is being asked to allow someone with significant legal troubles, drug history, and connections to dangerous people to move into their family home with children present. The friend has:
- Lost her job with Child Services due to meth use
- Potentially destroyed evidence in a drug investigation that resulted in overdose deaths
- An ex-boyfriend who is abusive and facing multiple criminal charges
- Active legal investigations she may be involved in

The author's concerns about protecting their family, home, and careers from potential retaliation, legal entanglement, or exposure to criminal activity are entirely reasonable and responsible. As a parent and homeowner, they have a primary duty to ensure their family's safety and stability.

However, the author isn't refusing to help entirely - they're offering a substantial financial compromise by paying 1-2 months rent for an apartment, which would provide the same assistance without the risks to their household.

The wife's desire to help is admirable, but her dismissal of legitimate safety concerns and calling the author ""selfish"" for prioritizing their family's wellbeing seems unreasonable. The ""life lesson"" argument doesn't justify exposing children to potentially dangerous situations.

While the friend deserves compassion for her difficult circumstances, the author's responsibility to protect their own family takes precedence, especially when they're still offering meaningful help through alternative means.

The author acknowledges that companies aren't obligated to give bonuses at all, which shows some awareness of the reality. However, they're expressing disappointment about a significant reduction from what appears to have been a substantial bonus (equivalent to a full paycheck) down to $50 (about $30 after taxes).

While it's natural to feel disappointed when compensation decreases, the author seems to be taking this as a personal slight or indication that the company doesn't value their work. However, there could be many legitimate business reasons for reduced bonuses - economic conditions, company performance, budget constraints, etc. The author doesn't appear to have considered these possibilities or attempted to understand the company's perspective.

The comparison to it being ""less of a slap to the face"" to receive no bonus at all suggests the author may be taking this too personally and not considering the broader context. Companies often have to make difficult financial decisions, and maintaining some bonus, even if reduced, could actually indicate they're trying to show appreciation within their constraints.

The author's reaction seems somewhat entitled, as they're treating what is essentially a gift as an expectation and interpreting the reduction as an insult rather than considering legitimate business reasons.

The author approached this thoughtfully - he recognized his friends likely weren't targeting him personally, but he still felt uncomfortable with blanket negative statements about men as a group. When he reached a breaking point, he communicated privately and respectfully about his feelings rather than making a public scene.

However, his analogy comparing ""I hate men"" to ""I hate Mexicans"" or ""I hate women"" was problematic. These comparisons don't account for different historical and social contexts - the power dynamics and systemic oppression faced by racial minorities and women versus men are not equivalent. This analogy likely came across as tone-deaf and undermined his otherwise reasonable request.

The friend's response was also problematic. Rather than engaging with his feelings constructively, she dismissed them and made implications about his character (""if you find it offensive you're probably doing something bad""). She then involved mutual friends rather than working through the disagreement privately.

Both parties made mistakes in how they handled this conflict - the author with his flawed analogy and the friend with her dismissive response and decision to involve others. However, the core issue (feeling hurt by friends' language) was valid and deserved a more thoughtful discussion.

The author and their sister have legitimate reasons for wanting to connect with potential half-siblings - they grew up without their father, experienced significant trauma, and recently learned of his death. The desire to understand their family connections and potentially build relationships with half-siblings is understandable and not inherently wrong.

Their approach has been relatively cautious - the sister asked general questions about the match's parents without revealing specific details about how they might be related. This shows some consideration for the potential impact.

However, the mother raises valid concerns about the potential consequences. Contacting DNA matches could indeed disrupt families, reveal affairs, or expose family secrets that could cause significant emotional harm to innocent people who had no role in creating this situation.

The key issue is that both perspectives have merit. The author has legitimate emotional needs and rights to seek family connections, while also needing to consider the potential harm to others. This appears to be a situation where people are trying to navigate complex emotional territory without clear right or wrong answers.

The author seems genuinely conflicted and seeking guidance rather than acting recklessly, which suggests they're trying to balance their needs with consideration for others.

The author is in a stable job with good benefits and growth potential, and is making a reasonable financial argument against taking on student debt when his current trajectory looks promising. His suggestion that his wife explore other job opportunities isn't inherently unreasonable, especially given her current job offers poor pay and no benefits.

However, the wife has fibromyalgia (a chronic pain condition) and anxiety issues that she's sought counseling for. These are legitimate medical conditions that can significantly impact job performance and career options. Her concern that changing jobs could be more physically or mentally demanding is understandable, especially since she's found a routine that works with her conditions, even if the compensation is poor.

The key issue seems to be a communication breakdown where both parties are focused on why the other should make changes rather than working together to find solutions. The author appears to dismiss or minimize his wife's medical limitations, while the wife seems unwilling to even explore possibilities.

Neither person is being entirely unreasonable in their position, but both could handle this better.

The author accepted a babysitting job without asking important questions about the child's age, needs, or any special requirements. When they arrived and discovered the situation was beyond their capabilities (caring for a teenager with significant developmental disabilities), they left without any communication to the parent. This left the parent stranded without childcare and potentially put the teenager at risk of being left alone.

However, the parent (Sarah) also failed in her responsibility by not disclosing crucial information about her son's age and care needs when arranging the babysitting. A 16-year-old with severe developmental disabilities requires specialized care that's very different from typical babysitting, and any reasonable parent would know to discuss these requirements upfront.

Both parties made significant errors: the author should have asked more questions and handled the situation more responsibly when they realized they were unqualified, while the parent should have been transparent about the care requirements from the beginning.

The ex-girlfriend's pattern of behavior includes:
- Repeatedly breaking up to date others as manipulation tactics
- Moving on extremely quickly after a 2-year relationship
- Engaging in sexual behavior with multiple friends of her ex immediately after the breakup
- Sending provocative messages and being dismissive when the author tried to establish boundaries

The author's response includes:

- Setting reasonable boundaries by asking for space
- Using derogatory language (""slut"") to describe his ex

- One friend started dating the ex very quickly after the breakup, though he expressed remorse
- Another friend participated in inappropriate video calls with the ex

However, the ex-girlfriend's manipulative pattern of using breakups and other people as weapons, combined with the friends' poor judgment in engaging with her so quickly after the relationship ended, represents more significant wrongdoing.

4. The author dismisses her concerns and justifies taking her food based on gender differences in food needs

The most problematic behavior is the pattern of not respecting ""no"" as an answer and continuing to pressure until getting compliance. When someone says no to sharing their food, that should be respected. The fact that she ""pouts"" afterward suggests she's not genuinely consenting but feeling coerced.

The author's justification that ""guys need more food"" doesn't address the core issue - if he needs more food, he should order more for himself rather than taking from someone who has already said no.

The author is 18 and legally has the right to make their own medical decisions. However, they're discontinuing medication for bipolar disorder without proper medical supervision, which is concerning given that:

1. Bipolar disorder is a serious mental health condition that typically requires ongoing treatment
2. The psychologist specifically noted that the author feels ""normal"" because of the medication - a common experience that can lead to discontinuation
3. The author admits to previously being ""reckless"" 
4. They're making this decision based on feeling fine for only two weeks off medication

The mother's concern is understandable given the serious nature of bipolar disorder, though posting about it on Facebook was inappropriate and violated the author's privacy.

The author seems to be experiencing a common pattern where people with bipolar disorder stop taking medication when they feel stable, not recognizing that the stability often comes from the medication itself. The timing (feeling fine for just two weeks) suggests they may not have experienced the full effects of being unmedicated yet.

The author has legitimate concerns about:
- The impact on the elderly, anxious dog who has been an only pet for 13 years
- The long work hours (12+ hours away) being unsuitable for a young, high-energy husky
- The potential stress on both animals

The author has already gently tested the waters with a mild comment and received a defensive response. They're now questioning whether to be more direct or let it go entirely.

The author's motivations appear to be genuine concern for animal welfare rather than malicious intent. Having concerns about pet welfare and considering whether to voice them is not inherently wrong. The author hasn't been pushy or overstepped boundaries yet - they made one gentle comment and are now thoughtfully considering their next steps.

The friend's defensive reaction suggests she may not be as open to feedback as would be ideal, but that doesn't make the author wrong for having concerns or considering whether to express them.

While the friend and boyfriend may be making a poor decision regarding the adoption, the author hasn't actually done anything problematic in this scenario - they're just contemplating how to handle a difficult situation involving animal welfare.

We did not hav...,Author,Everybody,0.72,0.8148148148148148,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the responsibilities and actions of both parties.

The author made several choices that created her current financial difficulties: cheating on and breaking up with her ex, having two additional children while already struggling financially, remaining unemployed as a stay-at-home parent, and now wanting to increase child support from her ex to help support her entire family (including children that aren't his).

However, the ex-boyfriend also has clear legal and moral obligations as a father. If he's moving to a full-time engineering position, his income will likely increase significantly, and child support should typically be adjusted to reflect the non-custodial parent's actual earning capacity. His disapproval of her life choices, while understandable, doesn't change his parental responsibilities.

The author's request for increased child support specifically for their shared child would be reasonable given his improved financial situation. However, her apparent intention to use this money to support her entire family (including two children who aren't his) is problematic and suggests she's trying to make him financially responsible for consequences of her other relationships.

Both parties have made poor decisions - she through her life choices and financial irresponsibility, and he potentially through not ensuring adequate support for his child despite having the means to do so.

The author (25) made inappropriate sexual jokes to a minor (16) who had just turned 16, including a ""legal in certain countries"" comment and BDSM references. Even after the minor said ""no,"" the author continued with dark humor that made the minor uncomfortable. The author claims they thought they had ""made it clear"" they were no longer joking, but this seems like poor communication at best.

The minor's response of involving others and messaging the author's fiancé without explanation was also problematic and caused unnecessary drama. However, the minor then ""taunted"" the author, which escalated the conflict.

The author's final response was extremely harsh - calling the minor ""basically an insect"" and saying they ""won't amount to anything in life."" This is a disproportionate and cruel response from an adult to a teenager.

While both parties made mistakes, the author bears significantly more responsibility as the adult in this situation. They initiated inappropriate sexual humor with a minor, failed to properly recognize and respect the minor's discomfort, and then responded with devastating personal attacks when confronted. The power imbalance and the author's role as the adult makes their behavior particularly problematic.

However, the other person also bears some responsibility. After the author politely declined having cash, the guy responded with indignation and hostility (""MAN. Serious. Can't believe you man!

The author is a 19-year-old expressing genuine concern about her 18-year-old sister dating a 43-year-old man. The age gap (25 years) and the sister's inexperience with relationships are legitimate red flags. The author's protective instincts are understandable.

However, the key issue is the author's approach. She's demanding to meet the boyfriend and threatening to not ""allow"" the relationship to continue if denied. The sister is legally an adult who has the right to make her own relationship choices, even poor ones. The author has no actual authority to ""allow"" or ""disallow"" her sister's relationships.

While the author's concerns are valid and her intentions appear good, her controlling approach crosses boundaries. She's treating her adult sister like a child under her authority rather than respecting her autonomy while offering support and guidance.

The sister's secrecy about the relationship is concerning but understandable given the author's controlling stance. The older man's behavior could be problematic, but we don't have enough information about him to make that determination.

The author is primarily at fault for taking an authoritarian approach rather than a supportive one with her adult sister.

The author is using his own birthday money to purchase a Pro Controller specifically because the shared Joy-Cons are malfunctioning due to drift issues. His concerns about letting his brother use it seem reasonable given the brother's history of dropping the Switch, throwing controllers when angry, and the pattern of using others' items to avoid spending his own money on replacements.

The author's position is supported by:
- He's purchasing it with his own money
- He has legitimate concerns about damage based on past behavior
- The brother has alternative ways to play his preferred games
- He asked permission when using his brother's headphones, showing respect for ownership

The brother and parents seem to expect sharing simply because it's gaming equipment in a household with a shared console, but this ignores that it's a personal purchase made necessary by the deteriorating condition of the shared controllers.

While family sharing can be important, the author's concerns about potential damage and his right to protect something he personally purchased are valid. The parents dismissing these concerns without addressing the underlying issues (the brother's treatment of electronics and spending priorities) seems unreasonable.

The author has legitimate grievances - they've been putting significant effort into the relationship (planning trips, buying gifts, providing ongoing help) while receiving minimal reciprocation on important occasions like anniversaries, Valentine's Day, and birthdays. The husband's last-minute approach to the author's birthday is particularly telling.

However, the author is considering withholding help with something practical and important (car repairs) as a way to express their frustration about unrelated relationship issues. This creates a few problems:

1. It's passive-aggressive rather than direct communication
2. Car repairs are a practical necessity, not a luxury or gift
3. The author acknowledges they're good at negotiating and could help significantly
4. This approach could escalate relationship problems rather than resolve them

The husband does bear responsibility for being inattentive to important relationship milestones and not showing appreciation for the author's efforts. However, the author's proposed response - withholding practical help out of spite - isn't constructive.

Both parties have contributed to this situation: the husband through neglect and lack of appreciation, and the author through choosing passive-aggressive retaliation over direct communication about their needs.

The brother has consistently shown poor care for both his own games and the author's games - leaving disks on the floor and allowing them to get scratched. This establishes a clear pattern of irresponsible behavior with other people's belongings. When someone repeatedly damages your property through carelessness, it's entirely reasonable to want to protect future purchases from the same treatment.

The author is using their own money to buy these games and has every right to set boundaries about who can use their personal property, especially when there's documented evidence of mishandling. The author even acknowledges feeling bad about the situation and recognizes the brother's genuine interest in the games, which shows they're not being vindictive.

The brother's implied threat to involve parents if denied access to the games is manipulative and further demonstrates problematic behavior. Adults and older teens should be able to handle being told ""no"" regarding someone else's property without running to authority figures.

While the author could potentially explore compromise solutions (like supervised play or requiring the brother to replace any damaged games), they have no obligation to risk their expensive purchases being damaged by someone with a proven track record of carelessness.

The author was clearly under significant stress from finals, feeling mentally exhausted, and had their morning disrupted by having to manage the dogs. When asked to triple their meal preparation while already cooking, they declined due to lack of energy but offered a reasonable compromise of making something simpler for dinner.

The mother's response seems disproportionate to the situation. Calling the author ""incredibly negative,"" ""cruel,"" and ""abusive"" for simply declining to cook additional food while offering an alternative appears to be an overreaction. The author was dealing with legitimate stress and fatigue, made a reasonable boundary about their energy levels, and still offered to help with dinner in a different way.

While the author did get frustrated and cry, this seems like a normal stress response rather than cruel or abusive behavior. The mother's continued comments to the dogs and family members about the author being ""cruel and abusive"" for this incident appears to be escalating the conflict unnecessarily.

That's fine, god knows I h...",Author,Other,0.72,0.76,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider whether the girlfriend's behavior crosses reasonable boundaries and whether the boyfriend's concerns are valid.

The girlfriend is openly fawning over a fictional character in front of her boyfriend and friends, reading ""raunchy fanfiction,"" and displaying what the boyfriend describes as obsessive behavior. While having fictional crushes is normal, the extent and public nature of her expressions - especially the sexual fanfiction and constant verbal gushing in front of others - goes beyond typical fandom appreciation.

The boyfriend's feelings are understandable. He's not asking her to stop playing the game or enjoying the character, but rather expressing discomfort with the intensity and public nature of her romantic/sexual fixation. His comparison to how this behavior would be received if directed toward a real person is reasonable - most partners would be uncomfortable with their significant other openly fantasizing about and fawning over someone else, even if fictional.

However, the boyfriend hasn't indicated he's actually communicated his feelings to his girlfriend yet, which is important for resolving the issue. But his concerns themselves are valid.

...",Other,Other,0.92,0.85,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the fundamental issue of bodily autonomy and consent.

The author has clearly communicated that he doesn't like having his pimples popped - it's painful, makes things worse, and irritates him. Despite knowing this for years, his girlfriend has continued to do it because she finds it ""satisfying"" and enjoys it. Now that his skin condition has worsened due to medication, he's decided to set a firm boundary about his own body.

The girlfriend's response is concerning. She's treating his bodily autonomy as something being ""taken away"" from her, getting angry and offended when he says no to something being done to his own body. Her argument that ""all relationships have sacrifices"" fundamentally misunderstands what constitutes reasonable relationship compromises - bodily consent is not something that should be sacrificed.

While I can empathize that this might be a compulsive behavior for her, having a compulsion doesn't give someone the right to override another person's bodily autonomy. The author has been more than accommodating for years, allowing something he disliked because she enjoyed it, but he has every right to withdraw that consent - especially when it's negatively affecting a medical condition.

The author is simply asserting a basic right to control what happens to his own body. This is not unreasonable or punitive.

The author acknowledges several key points:
1. They were heavily intoxicated and their memory/judgment was impaired
2. They're uncertain whether the initial contact was intentional or accidental
3. Their response (throwing someone down and stomping on their face three times, causing bleeding) was disproportionate to what they received (a punch that ""wasn't hard"")
4. The other person was unable to defend themselves during the stomping
5. They left the scene when police arrived

Even if the initial punch was intentional, the author's response crossed into excessive violence. Stomping on someone's face multiple times while they're down and defenseless goes well beyond reasonable self-defense or retaliation. The author seems to recognize this disproportion in hindsight.

The other person may have been wrong if they intentionally punched the author, but the author's response was so disproportionate that it overshadows the initial incident. The author chose to escalate rather than de-escalate or seek help.

The author's friends calling this behavior concerning isn't necessarily ""hippie dippy moral superiority"" - it's a reasonable reaction to hearing about someone stomping on a defenseless person's face.

The author works full-time (sometimes 7 days a week) while his wife is a stay-at-home mom. However, their child is at grandparents for about 25% of the time (1 week per month). The core issue is that the wife isn't doing housework regularly, and when the author refuses to help, he justifies it by saying it becomes ""such a big task"" when not done regularly - which creates a circular problem.

While there's validity to having different primary responsibilities in a household (breadwinner vs. homemaker), the author's rigid stance that he's ""responsible for working"" and she's ""responsible for all of that"" housework seems inflexible and potentially unfair. The fact that housework has become such a big task suggests it's been neglected for a while, and his refusal to help perpetuates the problem.

However, the wife also bears some responsibility here - if she's home and not working outside the house, especially during the week when their child is at the grandparents, it's reasonable to expect her to handle more of the household management.

The husband appears genuinely motivated to improve himself and be a better father and husband. His self-awareness about being ""lazy"" and out of shape, combined with his dedication to his family (only 6 social outings in a year), suggests sincere intentions. He frames this as a catalyst for positive change rather than just a vacation.

However, the wife's reaction - laughing then getting angry - indicates she sees this very differently. From her perspective, she'd be left alone with three very young children (ages 4, 4, and 1) for about a week while he pursues what she views as a vacation. This is an enormous burden, especially with twins and a toddler.

The core issue is that while his goals are admirable, this approach prioritizes his needs over immediate family responsibilities. There are many ways to get in shape, combat depression, and become a better role model that don't involve international travel and leaving his wife with such a heavy childcare load.

The timing seems particularly problematic - with three children under 5, this is likely one of the most demanding periods of their marriage. His wife needs support, not additional burden.

The author discovered concerning evidence that her boyfriend's best friend was harassing women online - making them uncomfortable and insulting them when they expressed discomfort. Multiple women corroborated similar experiences. This suggests a pattern of disrespectful behavior toward women.

The author's decision to share this information with her boyfriend seems reasonable and ethical for several reasons:
1. She was genuinely shocked and concerned about the behavior
2. The boyfriend regularly spends time with this person
3. She approached it by asking if he was aware, not demanding action
4. This information could be relevant to the boyfriend's safety and the safety of other women in their social circle

The boyfriend's reaction is problematic. Rather than being concerned about his friend's behavior toward women, he's angry at his girlfriend for bringing it to his attention. He explicitly states he doesn't want to know when his friends are ""being shitty"" and resents her for ""ruining"" the friendship. This suggests he values his comfort and friendship over addressing harmful behavior toward women.

- He refuses to pay any rent despite his name being on the lease
- He dismisses reasonable alternative contributions (cooking/cleaning) as ""slavery"" and ""controlling"" 
- He gets angry when disagreed with and makes hurtful personal attacks
- He claims she doesn't love him when she maintains reasonable financial boundaries
- He expects to live somewhere without contributing anything meaningful

While the boyfriend does have legitimate financial constraints due to student loans, this doesn't justify expecting free housing or refusing all forms of contribution. His reaction of anger and personal attacks when presented with reasonable options is particularly problematic.

The author is trying to find workable solutions while the boyfriend is being inflexible and manipulative.

My boyfriend and I have be...",Author,Everybody,0.72,0.5,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the expectations and communication between both parties during a difficult time.

The author is grieving the sudden loss of their grandmother and expected their boyfriend to automatically know they needed support without explicitly asking. While grief can make communication difficult, the boyfriend did make efforts to be supportive - he helped sell the ticket and offered to stay with them, albeit last minute. The author chose not to respond to his offer, which sent mixed signals.

The boyfriend's timing wasn't ideal (offering 30 minutes before leaving), but he was in a difficult position too. They had both been looking forward to this event for a long time, the author had already decided not to go and arranged to sell their ticket, and there was no clear communication about wanting company.

While it would have been more considerate for the boyfriend to proactively offer support earlier, the author's expectation that he should automatically know what they needed without being asked, combined with not responding to his actual offer of support, creates a communication breakdown that both parties contributed to.

The anger is understandable given the grief, but the situation stems more from miscommunication and unmet expectations rather than malicious intent from either party.

The author helped a mentally challenged person hide from their carers, which prevented her from receiving proper care and support. While the author frames this as ""helping a troubled person,"" they were actually interfering with the care system designed to protect someone vulnerable. The author admits their motivation was selfish - seeking personal purpose rather than genuinely helping the person.

However, the author's motivations, while misguided, don't appear malicious. They seem to be struggling with their own mental health and purpose in life. The real issue is that they made a decision that put a vulnerable person at risk and involved others (their friend and the boss's daughter) in potential legal trouble without fully considering the consequences.

The mentally challenged person was likely trying to exercise some autonomy by running away, but as someone who needs care support, this created a dangerous situation. The carers and authorities were doing their job trying to locate someone vulnerable who had gone missing.

This appears to be a case where the author made poor decisions with unintended but serious consequences, driven by their own struggles rather than malice.

While Ryan's threat to weaponize a joke against the author's academic standing was vindictive and disproportionate, the author's response crossed a significant line. Publicly exposing someone's private relationship issues and infidelity in a group chat with classmates was unnecessarily cruel and humiliating, regardless of the provocation. The author even acknowledges that most people found their response ""unnecessarily rude.""

The ex-boyfriend was clearly problematic - he was a pathological liar, manipulative, financially exploitative, and a cheater who gaslit the author when confronted with evidence. His behavior was consistently harmful and dishonest throughout the relationship.

The author's response, while understandable given the hurt and betrayal they experienced, was deliberately calculated revenge. They specifically chose a venue knowing their ex would be there, targeted his best friend with the explicit intention of hurting him, and then made sure he knew about it with the winking emoji text. This was premeditated retaliation designed to cause maximum emotional damage.

The best friend (HF) also bears responsibility - he betrayed his friend's trust and actively lied to him during the phone call while the author was present.

While the ex-boyfriend's behavior was terrible and the author's anger was justified, deliberately orchestrating this revenge scenario crosses into asshole territory. The fact that it was so carefully planned and executed specifically to hurt the ex, rather than being a spontaneous decision, makes it particularly problematic. Two wrongs don't make a right, even when one wrong is significantly worse than the other.

The girlfriend clearly has ongoing hygiene problems that she's sensitive about, which suggests she may be struggling with depression, health issues, or other personal challenges. However, the author's approach seems problematic - he describes going through a ""ridiculous performance"" to bring up the smell, continuing to mention it multiple times throughout the day (""banging on about it"" as she put it), and then calling the situation ""ridiculous"" when she was already upset and embarrassed.

While basic hygiene is important in relationships, the author's repeated comments throughout the day, his dismissive attitude toward her feelings, and his refusal to drop the subject when she asked him to ""leave it"" show a lack of sensitivity. His approach escalated what could have been handled more tactfully.

The girlfriend's hygiene issues are concerning, but her emotional response seems understandable given how the situation was handled. She was clearly embarrassed and hurt, and the author continued pushing when she wanted to move on.

The author is a professional student who has had traumatic roommate experiences that affected their mental and physical health, even causing nightmares. They're willing to pay double rent to avoid potential roommate issues during an extremely demanding academic period. They've communicated their concerns clearly to their parents multiple times.

The parents purchased a two-bedroom property as an investment, expecting rental income from both rooms. They dismiss their child's mental health concerns, calling them ""dramatic"" and coming from a culture that mocks mental health issues. However, they did make a significant financial investment with certain expectations about rental income.

The key factors here:
- The author has legitimate trauma-based concerns about roommates
- They're offering to pay the full rent themselves, which addresses the parents' financial concerns
- The parents are dismissing valid mental health considerations
- The property purchase was made with mutual understanding, though expectations weren't perfectly aligned

While the parents have financial interests to consider, their dismissal of their child's mental health concerns and refusal to accept a reasonable compromise (paying double rent) seems unreasonable.

The student describes being falsely accused of phone use, which seems genuinely unfair based on their account and the counselor's reaction. The teacher does appear to have some problematic classroom management approaches. However, the student's response - creating a meme page specifically to mock their teacher - crosses an important line.

While the student felt justified due to perceived mistreatment, creating public content to ridicule a teacher goes beyond reasonable response to classroom conflicts. The fact that they learned about the teacher's recent loss of her husband and felt guilty suggests they recognized this was potentially hurtful. Even though they considered taking it down, they ultimately decided to continue.

The teacher may have grief-related reasons for her behavior, but that doesn't excuse unfair treatment of students. However, two wrongs don't make a right, and the student's choice to publicly mock their teacher rather than address the issues through proper channels (like they successfully did with the counselor) was inappropriate.

The student acknowledges feeling this might be ""morally wrong"" and shows some awareness of the impact, but continues anyway. This suggests they understand the ethical issues but are choosing to proceed.

One of them has to be crated because he gets anxiety and likes to chew on...,Author,Author,0.75,0.625,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to evaluate whether the author's response to their dogs' muddy digging behavior is appropriate or problematic.

The dogs are engaging in natural instinctive behavior - digging in mud when it rains. While this creates mess and inconvenience for the owner, the dogs aren't acting maliciously or doing anything inherently wrong from their perspective. They're just being dogs.

The author's response involves yelling loudly at the dogs and confining them to crates overnight as punishment. This seems disproportionate and potentially harmful. Overnight crating as punishment for natural behavior, combined with loud yelling, could increase anxiety (especially concerning given one dog already has anxiety issues) and isn't an effective training method.

The author acknowledges the dogs are ""following instinct"" but then contradicts this by believing they ""know what they're doing is wrong"" and are ""hiding it."" This misinterpretation of normal dog behavior (dogs often prefer certain spots and may avoid areas where they've been yelled at) is leading to inappropriate punishment.

While I understand the frustration of dealing with muddy dogs, there are better solutions like blocking access to that area, providing alternative digging spots, or simply accepting that baths after rain are part of dog ownership.

The author's girlfriend was clearly upset about missing out on her absolute favorite Pokémon after playing all weekend in harsh conditions. Her emotional response, while intense, seems genuine given how much this meant to her. She explicitly stated she didn't feel entitled to the author's second Bulbasaur, but was hurt by the contrast between her willingness to sacrifice for him versus his unwillingness to do the same.

The author then ignored the doorbell and multiple phone calls while gaming, leaving their cousin standing outside after he went out of his way to help.

However, the cousin's reaction - posting about it on Instagram and deleting the author as a friend - seems disproportionate to the situation. A simple conversation about the miscommunication would have been more appropriate.

The girlfriend disclosed something personal from her past - signing up for sugar baby websites before they met due to financial need for travel. She claims she never sent photos and was honest about receiving messages from older men.

The author's reaction was quite harsh - he immediately questioned her ""self-respect"" and made her cry. While it's understandable that this revelation might be surprising or uncomfortable, his response was judgmental and hurtful. He attacked her character rather than trying to understand her situation or discussing his feelings constructively.

The girlfriend was being vulnerable and honest about her past, which happened before their relationship. She didn't actually engage in sugar baby activities according to her account, just signed up when in financial need.

The author did apologize after taking time to think, which shows some self-awareness. However, he's now obsessing over scenarios he's imagined (her sending photos) despite her denial, and wants to bring it up again, which suggests he hasn't truly moved past his judgmental reaction.

The author is maintaining no-contact with their brother due to safety concerns related to his substance abuse, which is a reasonable boundary. When it comes to the girlfriend, the author has chosen to remain silent rather than engage, which appears to be a deliberate choice to avoid conflict while still being civil (not actively rude or hostile).

The brother has put the author in danger due to substance abuse and is angry at them for not condoning his behavior. He's also demanding the author ""welcome"" his girlfriend despite the circumstances.

The girlfriend consistently displays disrespectful behavior in the parents' home - entering without acknowledgment, taking food without permission, being loud when others are trying to sleep, and using their address for mail without proper permission from the homeowners.

The parents, while in a difficult position, are enabling the disrespectful behavior by not setting boundaries due to fear of their son's potential self-destructive response.

The author is trying to navigate an extremely difficult family situation by maintaining necessary boundaries while avoiding escalation.

The author has legitimate emotional reasons for not wanting to participate - Christmas decorating holds special memories from when their parents were together, and using the same ornaments with a new partner feels like it diminishes those childhood memories. Their feelings are understandable and valid.

However, the author's approach was problematic. They explained their refusal in a way that was likely hurtful to their mother, essentially telling her that decorating with her new fiancé would be ""shitting on"" their childhood memories. This phrasing was unnecessarily harsh and hurtful.

The mother also handled this poorly. She became passive-aggressive when her child declined to participate, which created an uncomfortable atmosphere. She also made incorrect assumptions about the author being obligated to help based on living arrangements that weren't even accurate.

When the author eventually agreed to help, they deliberately remained visibly upset and refused to make any effort to improve the atmosphere, which was petty and made the situation worse for everyone involved.

They discussed this with their husband, who agreed it was excessive, and then set reasonable boundaries with the sister-in-law.

The sister-in-law and family, however, made assumptions about the author's availability based solely on their employment status, dismissed their stated commitments and need for personal time, and reacted poorly when reasonable boundaries were established. They're treating the author as an on-demand childcare service rather than respecting them as a family member with their own life and needs.

While I can sympathize with a struggling single mother needing help, that doesn't entitle someone to another person's time without proper communication, respect for boundaries, or consideration for their circumstances. The author was willing to help in emergencies but not serve as regular childcare - this is a reasonable position.

The author broke up with someone who was exhibiting manipulative behaviors including guilt-tripping, threats of self-harm, and suicide threats. After the breakup, the ex claimed she cheated, then said she lied about cheating, then it was confirmed she did cheat, and finally revealed it was actually sexual assault.

Key considerations:
- The author had legitimate reasons for the initial breakup (manipulative behavior, emotional burden)
- The ex's post-breakup behavior was extremely concerning (suicide threats, manipulation attempts)
- The author tried to maintain boundaries while encouraging professional help
- The ex gave multiple conflicting versions of events over time

The ex's behavior was problematic throughout - the manipulation, threats, and constantly changing story. But if the final account is true, she was dealing with trauma while also struggling with mental health issues.

While I understand the author's frustration after 13 years of this problem, their current approach of deliberately sabotaging others' lives makes them significantly more culpable than the people making honest mistakes with email addresses.

She's a huge romantic, gave me a lot of presents...",Author,Author,0.75,0.631578947368421,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the author's actions and motivations carefully.

The author admits to several problematic behaviors:
1. Dating someone they weren't attracted to and had no intention of having a long-term relationship with
2. Allowing the relationship to continue for months while accepting romantic gestures, knowing they didn't reciprocate those feelings
3. Lying about the reason for the breakup instead of being honest (though tactfully)
4. Essentially leading someone on ""out of guilt""

While the author's concern about not wanting to hurt her feelings shows some empathy, the fundamental issue is that they entered into and maintained a romantic relationship under false pretenses. They allowed her to invest emotionally and give romantic gestures while knowing they could never reciprocate. This caused significantly more harm than being honest earlier would have.

The other person (the ex-girlfriend) doesn't appear to have done anything wrong - she was genuine in her feelings and actions throughout the relationship.

The author acknowledges their guilt and seems to understand they made mistakes, but the pattern of deception and leading someone on for months makes them primarily responsible for the hurt caused.

The author seems to have good intentions - wanting to encourage their wife to explore her cultural heritage through cooking. However, there are several problematic aspects to their approach:

1. They made assumptions about what their wife ""should"" be able to cook based on her ethnic background
2. They used the term ""exotic"" to describe her family's food, which can be othering
3. When she explained she doesn't know how to cook those dishes, they persisted in telling her what she ""should"" do
4. They dismissed her suggestion that they could learn to cook these dishes themselves with ""I'm super white"" as an excuse

The wife's response was understandably defensive - she was being told she should embrace ""her culture"" through cooking when she had already explained she doesn't know how to make those dishes. Her suggestion that the author cook it themselves if they want it so much was reasonable.

While the author's intentions may have been positive, they made cultural assumptions, didn't listen when their wife explained her situation, and continued pushing their agenda. The approach was insensitive and based on stereotypes rather than understanding their wife's actual background and abilities.

The author made an unwelcome sexual advance while intoxicated, which their partner clearly communicated was triggering given both are sexual assault survivors. The author appropriately stopped when asked and apologized multiple times. However, the core issue seems to be the author's reaction to their partner's continued processing of the incident.

The author describes a relationship pattern where they provide most of the emotional support and accommodation. When faced with their partner's ongoing distress about the triggering incident, the author became frustrated with the silent treatment and tense atmosphere, ultimately trying to leave separately for work to avoid the discomfort.

Most concerning is the author's speculation that their partner might be ""using this incident as a tool"" or ""blowing it out of proportion"" to return to an unequal dynamic. This kind of thinking - questioning whether a sexual assault survivor is manipulating the situation when they're processing trauma - is problematic, even if the author acknowledges these thoughts might be wrong.

While the author's frustration with relationship dynamics is understandable, and their partner's communication style (silent treatment, anger without explanation) isn't ideal, the author's response to a sexual trauma trigger shows a lack of empathy and understanding. The attempt to avoid dealing with the aftermath and the suspicious questioning of their partner's motives crosses a line.

The author describes a pattern where:
1. Early attempts to open up were met with dismissal, disregard for safety concerns, and inappropriate responses
2. The mother now demands openness while continuing problematic behaviors (forgetting important details, using personal information against them, blocking mental health treatment)
3. The author has clearly communicated their boundaries and discomfort
4. The mother refuses to respect these boundaries and dismisses past harmful behavior

The author has the right to choose how they communicate and with whom they share personal information. They've made reasonable attempts to explain their position and set boundaries. The mother's approach of forcing intimacy while continuing harmful patterns is counterproductive and disrespectful of the author's autonomy.

The mother's behavior of dismissing past harm as something to ""get over"" while not changing current behavior, combined with blocking professional mental health support, suggests she is primarily at fault for the communication breakdown.

Ye...,Nobody,Author,0.72,0.5,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives of all parties involved.

The author and girlfriend have legitimate concerns about protecting their bond with the dog they've cared for over a year, and there could be valid reasons to worry about the previous owner's intentions. However, their approach of lying rather than having an honest conversation was problematic.

The previous owner appears to have made a reasonable request - just wanting to walk a dog he once cared for. There's no indication he was trying to reclaim the dog or being inappropriate. His request seems to come from a place of continued affection for the animal.

While the couple's protective instincts are understandable, lying was unnecessary and potentially hurtful. A honest conversation about boundaries would have been more appropriate. They could have explained their concerns or simply declined politely without deception.

The previous owner doesn't appear to have done anything wrong - he rehomed the dog responsibly when he couldn't care for it and made what seems like an innocent request.

We both decided last...,Other,Other,0.75,0.8333333333333334,True,"Looking at this situation, I can see a pattern of poor communication and behavior from the boyfriend that makes this primarily his responsibility.

The author made reasonable efforts throughout the evening - she let him sleep without complaint, took care of practical things like changing the show so he wouldn't miss anything, filled his water bottle, charged his phone, and gave him space when tensions arose. When she expressed feeling bored and lonely (which is a natural response to spending a planned special evening alone while her partner slept), she did so in a non-accusatory way.

The boyfriend's responses were consistently problematic: insincere apologies, dismissive ""I don't care"" responses to her attempts at affection, throwing her earlier offer to leave in her face, making personal attacks about her exercise habits and body, and generally being moody and rude despite her accommodating behavior.

While the author could have potentially handled some moments differently (like perhaps being more direct about her needs earlier), her overall approach was considerate and patient. The boyfriend's pattern of becoming difficult whether he sleeps or stays awake, combined with his hostile responses to reasonable communication, places the primary fault with him.

The author and this person had a brief romantic involvement (less than a month) without establishing an official relationship. While she did ask him to ""stay available"" before leaving to study abroad, this request was made while both were drunk, which affects the validity of such a commitment. Additionally, their current communication is minimal - just maintaining a Snapchat streak.

The author is being honest about his desires and is questioning whether he should honor this informal, alcohol-influenced request. He's not acting behind anyone's back or being deceptive. A year is a significant amount of time to wait based on such an unclear and informal arrangement, especially when there's no guarantee of what will happen when she returns.

The person who left for study abroad isn't necessarily at fault either - it's natural to want someone to wait, though asking someone to put their romantic life on hold for a year based on a drunken conversation is somewhat unreasonable.

This seems like a situation where both parties have understandable but potentially incompatible needs, and the lack of clear communication about expectations has created this dilemma.

The author appears to have some valid grievances - feeling abandoned when H became distant after starting college, H's disapproval of the relationship with D, and H not being supportive during difficult times like pregnancy scares. The author was also going through significant trauma and instability.

However, there are several concerning patterns in the author's behavior:
- Calling H a ""selfish bitch"" during conflict
- Expecting H to always accommodate transportation needs without reciprocating
- Demanding H be available for support through multiple crises while seemingly not acknowledging H's own life constraints
- Dismissing H's legitimate concerns about the financial and emotional burden of the friendship
- Not recognizing that H may have valid reasons for her boundaries

H also shows some problematic behavior - being unsupportive during genuine crises, making the friendship feel transactional around money, and perhaps not communicating her concerns constructively earlier.

The fact that a mutual friend agreed with H suggests there may be validity to H's perspective that the friendship had become one-sided. Both parties seem to have contributed to the deterioration through poor communication, unmet expectations, and failure to address underlying issues constructively.

This appears to be a case where both friends have legitimate grievances but have handled the situation poorly, leading to a breakdown in their relationship.

The author has actually handled this quite well - they've been completely transparent with Joey about their feelings for Monica, informed him that Monica likely has feelings for them instead, and encouraged Joey to have an honest conversation with Monica. They even gave Joey an ultimatum with a deadline to address the situation himself. The author is trying to balance loyalty to their friend with their own romantic interests.

Joey is in denial and refusing to have an honest conversation with Monica despite being encouraged to do so for six weeks. He's also presumptively referring to them as a couple without any mutual agreement, which is problematic.

Monica is the most problematic here - she's been ""stringing along"" Joey for four months while knowing he probably has feelings for her, waiting for him to confess so she can reject him. This is manipulative behavior that's causing unnecessary pain and confusion.

The author has been more than patient and transparent. They've given Joey ample opportunity and encouragement to resolve this himself. At some point, the author has a right to pursue their own happiness, especially when they've been so upfront about everything.

The author had legitimate challenges (illness, finals) but also made some questionable decisions. They joined a group late, couldn't meet during a crucial week due to scheduling, and then struggled to meet deadlines due to illness and other commitments. However, they did communicate their limitations, offered to do what they could, and ultimately found a solution by doing their own project.

The group members also have valid frustrations - they did most of the initial work and were counting on the author to complete their assigned portions. However, the 2am text message was unnecessarily harsh and unprofessional, especially given the author's explained circumstances of illness and finals.

The group members' anger is understandable given the stress of a looming deadline, but their communication was inappropriate. The author could have managed their commitments better or perhaps shouldn't have joined a group so late if they knew they had a heavy schedule.

The author admits they use Tinder ""mostly just for shits and giggles"" and for casual swiping when bored, without serious intent to date or hook up. They're in an open relationship but aren't sure they'd be comfortable with anything beyond what they've already done (kissing). When things got ""too real"" after someone asked for their number, they disclosed their situation.

While Tinder is primarily known as a dating/hookup app, the author did eventually communicate their situation when it became relevant. The matched person said he ""wasn't looking for anything in particular either,"" which suggests the outcome worked out fine for both parties involved.

However, the friend's criticism has merit - using a dating app without being clear about your intentions or availability can waste people's time and emotional energy. Many users assume others are genuinely available and interested in some form of romantic/physical connection.

The author seems to recognize this tension but argues they shouldn't be ""responsible for people's assumptions."" While technically true, there's an implicit social contract on dating apps about general availability and intent.

This appears to be a case where the author's approach, while not malicious, was inconsiderate of others' reasonable expectations on a dating platform.

The son was feeling sick and wanted to stay home from school.

The father then escalated by storming into the room, calling the son names like ""spoiled middle-class brat"" and ""weak."" When the father told the son to ""shut up,"" the son responded with ""you shut the fuck up,"" which prompted the father to grab him by the throat while he was lying in bed.

While the son's response was disrespectful and escalated the verbal conflict, the father's physical response - grabbing someone by the throat - crosses a clear line into physical aggression that is disproportionate to the verbal disrespect.

The author appears to have had a long-standing plan to move in with their friend, but the friend has now gotten into a relationship and wants to prioritize living with her boyfriend instead. The friend is asking the author to:
1. Stay on the lease to help her qualify (since the boyfriend can't due to probation)
2. Wait 6 months to move in
3. Eventually live as a third wheel with the couple

The friend seems to be trying to have it both ways - getting the author's help to secure housing while prioritizing her romantic relationship. She's essentially using the author's financial backing and lease eligibility while planning to live with someone else.

However, the author also seems to have some unrealistic expectations about controlling their friend's relationship choices and living arrangements. The complaint about how the boyfriend asked her to be his girlfriend seems petty and irrelevant to the housing situation.

The friend is being somewhat manipulative by asking for help while changing the original agreement, but the author also needs to accept that people's priorities change when they enter relationships.

1. A disputed rule interpretation in a family game
2. How the disagreement was handled by both siblings
3. The family dynamics that emerged

Regarding the game rule dispute: The brother's guess of ""anus"" when the answer was ""intestines"" seems to fall into a gray area. Both are parts of the digestive system, and the anus is technically part of the intestinal tract, making this more like the ""Hershey's/chocolate"" example than the ""LeBron James/Lakers"" example. The family even agreed the brother was right.

However, the bigger issue is how both siblings handled the disagreement. The author was stubborn and refused to acknowledge what seems like a reasonable interpretation, especially when the rest of the family agreed.

While the brother may have been acting immature by making ""a big fit"" and refusing to continue playing, the author's response was unnecessarily harsh and mean-spirited.

The author and boyfriend noticed someone who looked like the boyfriend's brother, which is innocent enough. However, the boyfriend then took a photo of this person without their consent to share with his other brother. While the author claims they were being ""sly"" in looking, their behavior was apparently obvious enough that the nearby older couple noticed and felt uncomfortable.

The key issue is that taking photos of strangers in public without permission is inappropriate, regardless of the innocent reason behind it. The older couple's reaction - feeling like they were being photographed and leaving - was a reasonable response to what appeared to be intrusive behavior.

The author asks if they're at fault for ""making them leave,"" but the real question is whether their behavior (along with the boyfriend's) was inappropriate. Even though there was a misunderstanding about who was being photographed, the couple's discomfort was justified based on what they observed.

The author has established clear, reasonable boundaries to protect their 7-year-old daughter from being around someone with an active heroin addiction. The mother-in-law has repeatedly violated these boundaries by:

1. Not disclosing when the brother-in-law would be present during visits
2. Exposing the child to a traumatic verbal altercation and drug-related interaction at a gas station
3. Lying about supervision arrangements (claiming father-in-law would be present when he wouldn't be)

The author's concerns are legitimate - the MIL has demonstrated she cannot be trusted to prioritize the child's safety over her emotional attachment to her addicted son. The author has shown flexibility by giving multiple chances and trying to find compromises (like requiring FIL's presence), but the MIL continues to violate agreements.

While the author acknowledges some personal dislike of the MIL, this doesn't invalidate the legitimate safety concerns. The child's wellbeing must come first, and the MIL has proven unreliable in maintaining appropriate boundaries around addiction-related situations.

The author is asking their grandparents to leave when they're undressed or changing clothes, which is a completely reasonable request for privacy. The grandparents, particularly the grandmother, are refusing to respect this basic boundary and are using ""respect your elders"" to justify staying in the room when the author is not clothed.

While yelling isn't ideal, the author states they've tried reasoning with them first and only resort to yelling when their reasonable requests are ignored. When someone's privacy and dignity are being violated, and normal communication has failed, raising one's voice becomes an understandable last resort.

The sister was just trying on swimsuits - completely normal behavior for a 14-year-old preparing for a family trip.

The author's comment was inappropriate and overstepping, even if well-intentioned. The dad's girlfriend's reaction, while protective of the sister, was unnecessarily harsh in its delivery.

Even though organic waste will eventually decompose, throwing it from a moving vehicle:
- Is still illegal littering in most jurisdictions

- May not decompose quickly in all environments
- Sets a poor example and normalizes littering behavior

I met her through Tinder and we hit it off right away and...",Author,Author,0.85,0.9313725490196079,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to evaluate the core issue: the author made a specific promise to stop using porn as a condition for the relationship, then broke that promise while hiding it.

The author's girlfriend was upfront about her boundaries from the beginning - she explicitly said she wouldn't date someone who used porn due to her traumatic experience with revenge porn. The author voluntarily agreed to this condition, saying he would ""cut it out entirely"" if she became his girlfriend. This was a clear, mutual agreement that formed the foundation of their relationship.

However, the author then deliberately broke this promise while concealing his actions, justifying it by thinking ""she wouldn't know and it didn't impact our relationship."" This shows a fundamental disrespect for the agreed-upon boundaries and his partner's clearly stated needs. The fact that he now calls the situation ""stupid"" and dismisses her very reasonable reaction as ""ridiculous"" and ""extreme"" demonstrates a lack of accountability.

While people can have different views on porn use in relationships, what matters here is that he made a specific commitment and then violated it. His girlfriend's reaction is entirely justified given that he broke a foundational agreement of their relationship. She trusted him based on his word, and he betrayed that trust.

The author is clearly at fault for making a promise he didn't intend to keep, breaking that promise, hiding his actions, and then blaming his girlfriend for having a reasonable response to his dishonesty.

The phrasing ""Before she notices"" suggests this order was likely made by someone else (possibly a partner or family member) and the author cancelled it without consulting them first.

The key issue here is that the author unilaterally cancelled someone else's order without discussion or permission. Even if they have shared access to the account, cancelling another person's purchase - especially an expensive one - without their knowledge or consent is problematic. The fact that they're asking if they should have it reshipped ""before she notices"" indicates they know this action was questionable.

While we don't have full context about the relationship dynamics or financial arrangements, the basic principle of respecting others' purchases and communicating before taking such actions suggests the author acted inappropriately.

The author is being thoughtful and responsible by:
- Recognizing their dog has trauma and may be regressing socially
- Planning to visit during off-peak hours to minimize encounters
- Wanting to help their dog while being considerate of others
- Asking for advice rather than just acting

However, asking other dog owners to leave or use a different area of a public park would be problematic because:
- Dog parks are shared public spaces where all well-behaved dogs have equal right to access
- Other owners shouldn't have to accommodate one dog's specific needs by relocating
- This could set a precedent for exclusionary behavior at public facilities

The author seems well-intentioned and is trying to be responsible, but the specific plan to ask others to move would be inappropriate. A better approach would be to leave if other dogs arrive, or work with a trainer in a more controlled environment.

Since the author is asking for advice before acting and shows genuine concern for doing the right thing, but the proposed action would be unreasonable, I'd say the author would be at fault if they followed through with asking others to leave.

The author accidentally lost his cousin's phone while using it underwater when the waterproof bag's string broke. While accidents happen, he was the one using the device and bears responsibility for its loss. However, he immediately acknowledged this responsibility and offered reasonable solutions - either giving her his own phone (which she refused) or paying her back over time within his financial means.

The cousin is being unreasonable by demanding an immediate replacement with a more expensive phone (iPhone X instead of the iPhone 7 Plus she lost), involving parents and creating family tension, and trying to force the author's father to guarantee payments. She's escalating what should be a straightforward matter between them.

The parents are also contributing to the problem by enabling the cousin's unreasonable demands and trying to involve the author's father as a guarantor, rather than helping find a reasonable middle-ground solution.

We have no i...",Author,Other,0.72,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives of all parties involved.

The author's girlfriend has legitimate concerns given the history between the author and his female friend - they made out twice, including while both were in other relationships (cheating). Even though the author claims the friendship is now platonic, the girlfriend's discomfort is understandable given this romantic/sexual history.

However, the author's reasoning also has merit. He regularly lets friends stay over regardless of gender, and his girlfriend has been okay with this in the past. The practical need (avoiding a long commute for an early meeting) was legitimate, and he was transparent by calling his girlfriend to inform her.

The girlfriend's anger seems disproportionate to the situation, especially since the author was upfront about it. While her discomfort is valid, getting ""really angry"" over what appears to be a practical arrangement between friends suggests some trust issues or insecurity.

The female friend appears to have made a reasonable request for practical reasons and doesn't seem to have done anything inappropriate.

The mother made clearly inappropriate and racially insensitive comments to the friend, asking about what ""color"" of boys he likes and doubling down when corrected. Her behavior was objectifying and made the guest uncomfortable. When confronted, she became defensive, denied what she said, and resorted to insulting her children as ""oversensitive millennials.""

The brother called out the racist behavior directly in front of his friend, which was appropriate given the circumstances. However, he later escalated the conflict with ""jabs and insults"" rather than trying to have a constructive conversation.

The author (OP) tried to handle the situation diplomatically, explaining why the comments were inappropriate and attempting to mediate. They showed understanding of their mother's background while still addressing the problematic behavior. Their approach was measured and constructive.

The friend was simply the victim of inappropriate comments and didn't contribute to any conflict.

While the author is questioning their own actions, they actually handled this difficult situation quite well - they stood up for their friend, tried to educate their mother respectfully, and attempted to de-escalate when things got heated.

The author has legitimate concerns - they've been planning their son's first birthday for months, have made significant travel arrangements and work leave commitments specifically for this celebration, and understandably want their first child's milestone birthday to be special and focused on him. A first birthday is particularly meaningful for parents, even if the child won't remember it.

The cousin's suggestion isn't inherently unreasonable - combining family celebrations can be practical, especially when family members are traveling from far away. However, the timing and approach are problematic. The cousin knew about the author's existing plans and travel arrangements, yet suggested combining the parties in a way that would essentially make the author's son's celebration secondary (just a ""smash cake so he didn't feel left out"" at the cousin's daughter's party).

The cousin could have approached this more collaboratively - perhaps suggesting a truly joint celebration where both children are equally celebrated, or discussing the timing conflict earlier to find a mutually beneficial solution.

While neither party has acted with malicious intent, the cousin's approach shows a lack of consideration for the author's established plans and the significance of this milestone for a first-time parent.

The author's child said a mild swear word after nearly tripping - a natural reaction that wasn't directed at anyone or said with malice. The author has reasonable house rules about swearing and immediately offered to apologize when informed that someone was offended.

However, the brother-in-law's demands escalate unreasonably. He wants the author to make a separate phone call to apologize to people she's never met, for something that was: 1) accidental, 2) not directed at them, 3) mild in nature, and 4) already apologized for.

The author's boundary-setting here is appropriate. She offered to apologize immediately but reasonably declined to make an anxiety-inducing phone call to strangers over such a minor incident. Her response wasn't rude - she was direct about her limits while still showing willingness to make amends in a reasonable way.

The author is concerned about exposing their future vaccinated child to unvaccinated cousins. While vaccines are highly effective, they're not 100% perfect, and newborns can't receive all vaccines immediately - there's a vulnerable period where they rely on herd immunity for protection. Additionally, some people cannot be vaccinated due to medical conditions and depend on community immunity.

The author's decision to protect their future child by avoiding exposure to unvaccinated individuals during the vulnerable early months is medically sound and represents responsible parenting. They're not trying to force their relatives to vaccinate or being confrontational - they're simply making a protective choice for their own child.

The parents suggesting this precaution is ""too extreme"" and ""not a huge deal"" are minimizing legitimate health concerns. While the relatives have the right to make their own vaccination choices (however misguided), they don't have the right to expose others to preventable diseases.

However, the girlfriend had unexpressed expectations about birthdays being ""extremely important"" to her - something she never communicated despite years together.

The author made a significant financial decision (buying a puppy) without consulting their spouse, which is a major breach of trust in a marriage where financial decisions should typically be discussed together. This is especially problematic since they mention the cost was substantial (""spent so much""). The author also admits to being under the influence of alcohol (""mimosas we had earlier"") when making this decision, which further undermines the judgment involved.

However, the author's motivation was genuinely compassionate - trying to save a puppy from being euthanized. The emotional manipulation by the store manager in a high-pressure situation, combined with alcohol consumption, created circumstances that led to poor decision-making rather than malicious intent.

The husband's anger is completely understandable given that major purchases should be joint decisions in a marriage, but the author did apologize and was acting from a place of compassion rather than selfishness.

The author has legitimate concerns about living compatibility - he acknowledges that he and his twin sister don't get along well when living together long-term, despite being close friends otherwise. He's also invested in creating a specific living environment with his roommates that works for them.

However, the key issue is that this isn't really ""his"" house more than it is hers. Their mother owns the property and has made it available to all her children on the same terms. The author moved in first and established the current setup, but that doesn't give him exclusive rights to exclude his sister, especially when she has equal claim to the arrangement their mother offered.

The author is essentially trying to claim territorial rights over a shared family resource based on his preferences rather than any actual greater entitlement. While his concerns about compatibility are valid, the solution isn't to exclude his sister from an opportunity that's equally hers by right.

The twin sister hasn't done anything wrong - she's excited about a living arrangement she has every right to pursue. The mother has been fair in offering the same deal to all her children.

However, the author seems to be dismissing their fiancé's decades of frustration with constant name misspellings and the emotional toll that takes.

The author has a genuine anxiety issue about being in other people's homes that affects all their relationships consistently - family, friends, romantic partners. They've been transparent about this limitation and have made efforts to maintain relationships through alternative ways of spending time together. They've even made some accommodations for this particular friend over the years by occasionally visiting her house despite their anxiety.

The friend, however, seems to be taking this very personally and repeatedly bringing up the same conflict despite the author's explanations and attempts to compromise. The friend is dismissing the author's anxiety as not being a ""real"" part of their personality and demanding they ""work on it"" specifically for her. She's also making unfair comparisons to past romantic relationships, which have different dynamics and expectations.

The author has a legitimate desire to see a band they enjoy again while in London for work. They've been transparent about their intentions and tried to have a reasonable discussion about it. Their reasoning that one shared experience shouldn't preclude future individual experiences is logically sound.

The sister's position is more emotionally driven - she admits she can't articulate exactly why she'd be ""furious"" and ""gutted"" if her sibling saw the band without her. While feelings are valid, demanding that someone else not attend a public concert simply because you can't go too is quite controlling behavior. She's essentially trying to dictate her adult sibling's entertainment choices based on her own emotional reaction.

The author is being considerate by discussing this beforehand rather than just going, and they're genuinely concerned about their sister's feelings. However, the sister's response of flat-out forbidding it and refusing to engage in reasonable discussion about why she feels this way suggests unreasonable possessiveness over a shared experience.

However, her continued passive-aggressive behavior after multiple genuine apology attempts seems somewhat excessive, especially since the author appears to be making good faith efforts to repair the situation.

The author made a mistake but tried to handle it maturely afterward. The woman's initial anger was justified, but her prolonged hostile response after repeated apologies seems disproportionate.

Like any teenager in the twenty-first century I've made my fair ...",Other,Nobody,0.85,0.75,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the author's actions and motivations carefully.

The author was contacted by someone making serious suicide threats, including claims of self-harm, photos of pills, and increasingly slurred speech suggesting potential overdose. The author spent hours trying to help, encouraged the person to call emergency services themselves, and only called police as a last resort when they genuinely believed someone's life was in danger.

The author followed reasonable escalation steps:
1. Attempted conversation and support
2. Encouraged the person to seek help themselves
3. Gave a warning before calling authorities
4. Only called when they had concrete evidence (photos, audio recordings, claims of ingesting pills)

The timing was unfortunate - the person responded just before police arrived - but this doesn't make the author's decision wrong. When someone's life may be at stake, erring on the side of caution is appropriate. The author couldn't have known the person would respond at that exact moment.

The police officers' dismissive attitude toward mental health crises and their lectures about taking suicide threats seriously are concerning and inappropriate. The author's parents' reaction also seems unsupportive.

The author acted with genuine concern for another person's welfare, used reasonable judgment given the information available, and followed appropriate protocols for handling a potential suicide emergency.

The author has a legitimate medical need for this specific, expensive tea to manage digestive issues and pain. They have a limited supply that needs to last while they're away from home. When the stepmother offered the tea to the sister without asking, the author politely explained their medical need for it.

The stepmother's response was problematic - she dismissed the medical necessity and went on a rant about sharing, then called the author rude when they expressed being upset. The ""we share in this house"" mentality doesn't reasonably extend to someone's medical supplies, especially when they're limited.

The author's reaction - becoming upset and then giving minimal responses - seems like a reasonable response to having their medical needs dismissed and being called rude for advocating for themselves. They didn't escalate further or become abusive; they just withdrew from the conversation.

The stepmother failed to recognize the difference between regular household items and medical necessities, dismissed the author's legitimate health concerns, and was unsympathetic when the author tried to explain their situation.

The author's frustration is completely justified - they went above and beyond by providing disposal equipment, yet coworkers still litter and show no consideration. The coworkers are clearly at fault for:
1. Littering despite proper disposal being available
2. Making a colleague clean up their mess

While the author may have been overly persistent in addressing the communication changes (which could come across as pressuring), her response was disproportionately harsh and insulting. Calling someone an ""idiot"" and being generally hostile crosses a line beyond what his behavior warranted. She could have simply explained she wasn't interested or set boundaries more respectfully.

However, the author did persist in confronting her about response times after she already gave an explanation, which shows some lack of social awareness about dating dynamics.

They've discovered their brother has a vape, which violates house rules, but they're genuinely concerned about the potential consequences - their brother losing his friend group and the impact on his mental health.

The author is showing maturity by considering multiple factors: their brother's anxiety and depression, the fact that he'd lose his only large friend group, and the reality that vaping is easily accessible at school. They're not trying to enable bad behavior, but rather weighing the proportionality of potential consequences.

The brother made a poor choice by vaping, but as a minor dealing with peer pressure and mental health issues, this seems like typical adolescent risk-taking rather than malicious behavior.

The mother's strict approach, while understandable from a parenting perspective, might be disproportionately harsh given the circumstances and could potentially worsen her son's mental health situation.

1. Child safety and appropriate environment
2. Legal liability as the primary tenant
3. Comfort level with exposing minors to drug use

These are reasonable concerns for any responsible adult to have. The author is trying to protect both the children and themselves from potential harm or legal issues.

The roommate, while not necessarily malicious, is being inconsiderate by:
1. Giving short notice for overnight guests
2. Not considering the appropriateness of the environment for young children

The author is expressing feeling inadequate about their partner having sexual fantasies about others and masturbating to those fantasies. They've communicated their feelings to their partner, who is dismissing their concerns and ""pretending like the whole ordeal is my fault.""

Key considerations:
- Sexual fantasies about others are generally considered normal and healthy, even in committed relationships
- The author states they ""never said they couldn't think about others"" - suggesting they're not trying to control thoughts
- However, the author is asking their partner to change this behavior, which could be seen as controlling

The author appears to be trying to set a boundary about something that's generally considered normal behavior, while the partner is being dismissive rather than empathetic.

The friend made deeply disturbing comments, calling the transgender speaker a ""cocky bitch"" who should be ""fucking put down"" - language that goes far beyond mere disagreement and ventures into dehumanizing hate speech that implies violence. This represents a fundamental moral failing on the friend's part.

The author is grappling with whether to maintain a friendship after discovering these shocking views. Choosing to distance oneself from someone who expresses such hateful, potentially violent rhetoric toward marginalized people is not only reasonable but arguably the morally correct response. The author is not obligated to maintain friendships with people whose values are fundamentally incompatible with basic human decency.

The author shows thoughtfulness by questioning their own reaction and considering the friendship's positive aspects, but this doesn't make them wrong for being disturbed by hate speech. Setting boundaries based on core moral values is healthy and appropriate.

The author had good intentions - wanting to protect someone they cared about. However, they crossed significant boundaries by:

1. Making physical threats to the boyfriend (""I break your bones"")
2. Interfering in someone else's relationship without their knowledge or permission
3. Taking actions that could have contributed to relationship problems or the eventual breakup
4. Putting the woman in an awkward position she never asked to be in

The woman's anger is completely justified - she has every right to be upset that someone made threats on her behalf without her consent and potentially interfered in her relationship. The boyfriend, while we don't know his role in the breakup, was threatened for simply being in a relationship.

This is deeply inappropriate and disturbing content to share, especially knowing the author is a ""HUGE cat lover"" who has been caring for these stray cats.

The author responded by yelling and swearing at him in anger. While the reaction was emotionally intense, it's an understandable response to hearing someone casually discuss animal cruelty with apparent amusement. The author was defending vulnerable animals they care about.

The author is a university student on an extremely tight budget (£20/week for everything), which makes the £5+ cost for apple sauce ingredients a significant financial burden. They expressed this legitimate concern when told (not asked) to bring the apple sauce.

However, the family's response was problematic. The mother made a demand rather than a request, and when the author explained their financial constraints, the siblings immediately attacked them as ""ungrateful"" rather than showing understanding or offering to help with costs. The brother's comparison isn't fair since he likely isn't dealing with the same severe financial constraints.

The author did eventually agree to do it and only asked that they would have preferred to be asked rather than told - this seems like a reasonable request for basic courtesy.

While family members often contribute to holiday meals, the way this was handled - making demands, dismissing legitimate financial concerns, and ganging up on the author when they tried to explain their situation - shows a lack of empathy and poor communication from the family members.

The author has already demonstrated significant generosity by letting their friend live rent-free for months. Now the friend is pressuring them for $300 to cover rent for an apartment where:

- The roommates moved in without jobs or financial stability
- They've been spending money on non-essentials like alcohol and furniture
- They have the option to return home
- This financial crisis occurred within just 3 weeks of moving in

The author is being reasonable in their assessment that this isn't a genuine emergency but rather poor financial planning. They're not obligated to continue subsidizing their friend's choices, especially when those choices appear financially irresponsible.

The author tried to address this politely at first (""I don't think she likes that""), and only became more assertive when the uncle ignored the initial request and the cat's distress escalated. The author was protecting their pet from what appears to be rough handling.

The father's response was also problematic - dismissing animal welfare concerns and enabling the uncle's behavior by calling the author ""overprotective"" and saying ""she's just a cat."" This attitude normalizes poor treatment of animals.

The author is dealing with a genuinely difficult situation. They were honest about never developing a deep emotional connection with their stepdaughter despite seven years of marriage and making genuine efforts. They showed consistent kindness and love outwardly, which demonstrates they tried to do right by the child. The divorce has left them emotionally raw, and continued contact is causing them pain.

However, the approach they're taking - slowly ghosting someone who considers them family and is actively trying to maintain a relationship - is causing harm to an innocent person. The stepdaughter, now an adult, formed what she believes to be a genuine familial bond and is being gradually abandoned without explanation. This ""slow fade"" approach, while perhaps intended to be kinder than brutal honesty, is likely more confusing and hurtful in the long run.

The author acknowledges the stepdaughter ""has done nothing wrong"" but is still choosing a method that will likely cause significant emotional damage. A more compassionate approach would be having an honest but gentle conversation about needing space, or seeking counseling to find a better way to handle this transition.

While the situation is understandably painful for the author, their chosen method of handling it is unfair to someone who views them as family.

2. **Opening blinds at 11:45am**: This is a reasonable time to open blinds, and she did notice you were there (you grunted) but it's her room too. This seems like normal daytime activity.

The author describes marrying solely due to pregnancy responsibility, not love or genuine desire for marriage. While taking responsibility for pregnancy is admirable, entering marriage primarily as an obligation rather than mutual commitment creates a problematic foundation. If the only reason for the wedding was the pregnancy, then cancelling after a miscarriage follows a certain logic - but it also reveals that the marriage wasn't based on wanting to build a life together.

However, this situation involves significant complexity around grief, timing, and communication. A miscarriage is a traumatic loss that both parties would be processing. The woman might be dealing with physical recovery, emotional grief, and now the additional stress of wedding uncertainty. Simply cancelling without careful consideration of her feelings and needs would be callous.

The key issue isn't necessarily the cancellation itself, but how it would be handled. If done abruptly or insensitively during a time of grief, or if it makes the woman feel like she was only valued for carrying a pregnancy, that would be harmful. The ethical approach would involve honest, compassionate communication about both parties' feelings and what they truly want moving forward.

The boyfriend's boss was clearly unprofessional and cruel in his handling of the rejection. His comments about being ""second best,"" telling her not to ""act like a spoiled child,"" and saying they don't want her ""out of pity"" were unnecessarily harsh and demeaning. A simple professional rejection would have sufficed.

However, the author's response - refusing to attend any of her boyfriend's shows or support his work because his boss was rude to her - seems disproportionate. She's essentially punishing her boyfriend for his boss's behavior, when her boyfriend had no control over the hiring decision and even agreed the boss was rude. Her boyfriend is caught in the middle of a difficult situation where confronting his boss could jeopardize his own career.

The boyfriend appears to be trying to navigate a challenging situation where he wants to support his girlfriend but also needs to protect his professional position. While he could potentially have been more assertive with his boss, it's understandable that he's reluctant to risk his career.

The author established a clear policy upfront - everyone pays $30 regardless of whether they're staying overnight. This was communicated in advance and initially agreed to by all attendees. The reasoning (helping cover costs for a birthday surprise) seems reasonable, and everyone makes similar income levels.

However, the couple has a valid point that paying the same amount without using the overnight accommodation does create some inequity. Their offer to contribute alcohol and goodies shows they want to contribute meaningfully to the event.

The key issue is how this disagreement escalated. While the couple had legitimate concerns, going around to other guests asking if they're paying creates drama and potentially undermines the host's arrangements for what was meant to be a birthday surprise. This behavior is problematic and could damage relationships within the friend group.

The author showed flexibility by offering to reduce their rate to $30 total for both of them, which demonstrates willingness to compromise.

The author made significant life decisions (moving to an expensive area, buying a house they didn't want) based on their parents' commitment to provide childcare. They repeatedly confirmed this arrangement and made it clear they couldn't afford daycare if the arrangement ended. When the mother suddenly quit due to health issues - which is completely understandable - she did so via text with minimal notice and no acknowledgment of the financial crisis this would create for her daughter's family.

However, the author also bears some responsibility. They made major financial commitments based on informal family arrangements without having backup plans. They chose to move to an expensive area and take on double mortgage payments, putting themselves in a financially vulnerable position. While they asked for reassurance, they didn't formalize any agreements or create contingency plans.

The parents, while having legitimate health concerns that required ending the childcare arrangement, showed poor judgment in how they handled the transition. The mother's apparent lack of understanding about the financial impact, despite being told multiple times about budget constraints, and the family's failure to offer any financial assistance when they know their daughter is struggling (especially after encouraging the move) shows a lack of consideration for the consequences of their decisions.

He gave mixed signals by going silent after being told not to come during dinner, then showed up unannounced at 9:44pm without any prior confirmation. Showing up at someone's house late at night without clear communication, especially after a history of flaking, demonstrates poor judgment and disrespect for boundaries.

The author made reasonable assumptions based on N's silence and their established need for sleep due to work commitments. While they could have potentially sent a follow-up text asking about his intentions, N's poor communication pattern and sudden appearance without confirmation puts the primary fault on him.

We know each other from college, but really got friends when we moved together in ...",Author,Author,0.75,0.943089430894309,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the key facts:

1. The author asked permission in advance for guests to stay
2. The roommate initially seemed open to it but was indecisive 
3. The roommate has a known quirk about cleanliness and guests
4. The roommate ultimately said no to people sleeping in his room
5. The author went ahead and let guests sleep in the roommate's room anyway without final permission

While the roommate's indecisiveness and cleanliness quirks are frustrating, and his lack of contribution to household management is problematic, the core issue here is about consent and boundaries regarding personal space. The roommate clearly said no to having guests sleep in his room, regardless of his reasons. The author then violated this boundary by allowing the guests to sleep there anyway.

Even though the roommate was indecisive and difficult, he has the right to control access to his private bedroom. The author should have found alternative arrangements (like helping friends find other accommodations) rather than overriding his roommate's explicit refusal.

The roommate's other behaviors (taking the bigger room, not helping with household management, being difficult about cleanliness) are separate issues from this specific boundary violation.

The girlfriend volunteered to help with shipping a collectible item and was given specific instructions. She admits to not reading the full instructions and making assumptions about the shipping method, choosing a less protective option despite being told the safer method was only a dollar more. This shows some carelessness with an important task she agreed to take on.

However, the author's response seems disproportionate to the mistake. While disappointment is understandable, completely shutting down communication - ignoring texts and calls from someone who is apologetic and trying to make things right - is an overreaction to what was ultimately a well-intentioned mistake. The girlfriend was doing a favor while the author was out of town, and mistakes happen even with good intentions.

The girlfriend made an error by not following instructions carefully, but the author's response of stonewalling communication is also problematic. Both parties contributed to escalating what could have been resolved with better communication.

My parents had a nasty divorce and ...,Other,Other,0.75,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives and actions of both parties.

The author's actions:
- Made a major life decision (moving back) without informing her mother
- Delayed responding to her mother's text for hours while doing other activities
- When she finally responded, it was with a brief, matter-of-fact statement that likely came as a shock
- While she was tired, she had energy to do extensive cleaning and organizing but not to make a quick call or text

The mother's actions:
- Had an extremely disproportionate and hurtful reaction
- Used manipulative language and threats
- Called the father a ""sperm donor"" and made cruel statements
- Immediately cut off phone service and health insurance in anger
- Escalated the situation far beyond what was warranted

While the author could have handled the communication better by giving her mother a heads up about such a significant move, the mother's response was emotionally abusive and completely out of proportion to the perceived slight. The author made a communication misstep, but the mother's reaction involved deliberate cruelty and punishment.

The core issue seems to be the mother's inability to regulate her emotions and her pattern of taking anger about the divorce out on her daughter, which the author mentioned as an ongoing problem.

The date partner's behavior was problematic in several ways:
- She misrepresented her interest in the museum (using it as a photo backdrop rather than genuine interest)
- She dominated conversations and consistently shut down the author when they tried to share
- She showed no consideration for the author's interests despite the author having knowledge about the art
- She made no gesture toward splitting the bill despite having ""so much fun""

However, the author also bears some responsibility:
- They had an expectation about bill-splitting but never communicated this
- They continued the date despite being miserable halfway through instead of politely ending it
- They faked engagement rather than addressing the conversational imbalance
- They seem to have assumed certain dating etiquette without discussing it

The date partner's behavior was more egregious - being self-centered, dismissive, and inconsiderate throughout the entire experience. While the author could have handled things better by communicating their discomfort or expectations, the fundamental issue was the other person's poor dating behavior and lack of basic courtesy.

The author was primarily reacting to genuinely inconsiderate treatment, even if their response wasn't optimal.

The author describes a respectful, balanced approach:
- They won't proactively bring up religious topics
- If asked directly by their child, they would honestly share their own beliefs
- They would offer to provide educational resources about religion
- They emphasize letting the child make their own informed decision

This approach demonstrates respect for the child's autonomy and intellectual development. The author isn't imposing their atheism, hiding information, or preventing the child from exploring religious beliefs. They're simply being honest about their own position while facilitating the child's ability to learn and choose for themselves.

There's no indication of disrespect toward religious people, no attempt to indoctrinate the child into atheism, and no refusal to allow religious exploration. The author is taking a neutral, educational stance that prioritizes the child's right to make informed decisions.

AITA for being mad at my dad for turning off the WiFi at night? 

Background: ever since I bought a PC with money I had saved my dad started turning off the WiFi. 

Hi...",Nobody,Other,0.72,0.6190476190476191,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives of both the author and their father.

The father's actions appear to have legitimate parental concerns behind them - wanting to ensure proper sleep schedules and managing screen time. Turning off WiFi at 10-11pm is actually a reasonable boundary for healthy sleep hygiene, especially for someone dealing with depression. The father is also paying for the internet service, which does give him authority over its use.

However, the author raises valid points about the timing and motivation. The WiFi restrictions only started after they bought their own PC with their own money, and the father had previously expressed disapproval of the purchase. The fact that the author can still access internet through their phone suggests this isn't really about internet access or sleep - it's specifically targeting the PC usage.

The author seems to be interpreting this as spite rather than genuine concern, and given the context provided, this interpretation appears reasonable. The selective nature of the restriction (only affecting the PC, not the phone) and the timing (only after the PC purchase despite previous internet access) suggests the father may be using his authority over the WiFi to indirectly control something he disapproves of but can't directly prevent since it was purchased with the author's own money.

While parents have the right to set household rules, using those rules to undermine a young adult's legitimate purchases made with their own money crosses into problematic territory.

The author has invested significant time, money, and effort into their Imperial Guard army over nearly a year. They've developed expertise and attachment to this faction. Their concern about wanting variety in their gaming group (bringing ""something fresh and new to the table"") has some merit from a gameplay perspective.

However, the author acknowledges they're being possessive over a game faction that they don't actually own exclusively. Larry has every right to choose whatever army interests him, regardless of what others are playing. The author's feeling ""slighted"" that Larry wants the same army suggests they view this as some kind of personal affront, when it's likely just Larry's genuine interest in that particular faction.

The author is self-aware enough to question whether they're being selfish, which shows some introspection. But ultimately, they're asking others to validate their desire to control what army their friend chooses to play, which crosses into unreasonable territory.

While the author's feelings are understandable, acting on them by discouraging Larry from choosing the army he wants would be inappropriate. Larry isn't doing anything wrong by wanting to play Imperial Guard.

The friend's father made a comment that could be seen as somewhat old-fashioned or paternalistic, but it appears to have been well-intentioned - likely coming from a place of caring about his daughter's friend. While not introducing himself first wasn't ideal etiquette, his comment ""I hope you're looking after her"" seems to have been meant in a protective, caring way rather than as an insult.

The author's response, however, was clearly sarcastic and confrontational. Responding with ""well yes, I hope you look after your wife also?"" was unnecessarily hostile and created awkwardness at what should have been a pleasant social gathering. This response was disproportionate to what was likely meant as a benign (if somewhat awkward) comment from an older generation person.

The author acknowledges making the situation awkward and that their girlfriend was unhappy with their behavior. The fact that they're questioning whether they were wrong suggests some awareness that their response may have been inappropriate.

One o...,Other,Everybody,0.72,0.8888888888888888,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the responsibilities and actions of each party involved.

The author clearly communicated her boundaries - she told her friend she wasn't interested romantically and only saw him as a friend. She even gave him an out by saying she'd understand if he didn't want to continue the friendship. This was appropriate and direct communication.

The friend said he could handle remaining friends and didn't want to lose the friendship, but according to the author, it's still obvious he likes her. If he's continuing to harbor romantic feelings while claiming he's moved on, or if he's subtly pursuing her despite her clear rejection, then he's not being honest about his intentions or respecting her stated boundaries.

The father and brother are essentially arguing that the author should take responsibility for managing another adult's emotions and decisions, using the problematic reasoning that ""that's just how guys are."" This places unfair burden on the author and excuses the friend's potential lack of respect for her clearly stated position.

However, the author does acknowledge that it's ""obvious he still likes me,"" which suggests she's aware the dynamic isn't healthy, yet she continues the friendship anyway.

While I understand the author's frustration with having to manage others' feelings and the ""that's just how guys are"" mentality, continuing a friendship where one person clearly hasn't moved on from romantic feelings (despite claiming otherwise) can be problematic for both parties.

The group of 4 was clearly disrupting the show by:
- Constantly talking during the performance
- Repeating punchlines
- Explaining jokes to each other
- Making it difficult for others to hear the comedian
- Continuing this disruptive behavior for 30 minutes

The author's response was:
- Waited a reasonable amount of time (30 minutes) before saying anything
- Made a polite, quiet request (""guys, you're killin' me here"")
- Only escalated after being confronted post-show
- Made a reasonable point about comedy show etiquette

The group's post-show behavior was particularly problematic - complaining to strangers about being asked to be quiet, then confronting the author and suggesting they should stay home if they can't tolerate talking during a performance. This shows a complete lack of awareness about appropriate venue behavior.

Basic etiquette at live performances, especially comedy shows, is to be quiet so everyone can enjoy what they paid to see. The author handled this appropriately by waiting, asking politely, and only defending themselves when confronted.

The author parked in a coworker's ""favorite"" spot - unless this was an assigned spot, parking in any available space is generally acceptable workplace behavior. However, the coworker retaliated by hiding the author's car keys, which is clearly inappropriate and potentially illegal (theft/interference with property). 

The author then escalated further by removing valve stems from the coworker's tires and deliberately not providing the tool to reinstall them. This response goes beyond the original offense and creates a safety hazard, as the coworker cannot drive their vehicle.

Both parties engaged in inappropriate retaliation that escalated the conflict. The coworker initiated the inappropriate behavior by hiding keys, but the author's response was disproportionate and potentially more serious (stranding someone and creating safety issues).

This is a clear case where both individuals made poor choices and contributed to an escalating workplace conflict through retaliatory actions.

While the girlfriend may have been disregarding their diet agreement, weddings are special occasions where people commonly make exceptions to their usual eating habits. The author could have addressed this privately later or simply let it go for one special event.

The author's method of ""taking a stand"" was controlling, embarrassing, and designed to shame his girlfriend in front of family members. This crossed a clear line from supportive partner to controlling behavior, regardless of any diet agreement they had.

The author made a joke using disability as a punchline about a sports team's poor performance. When someone expressed that they were offended because they are disabled, the author responded with ""edgy jokes"" and told them they ""have a problem"" rather than acknowledging the concern or apologizing.

While the other person's response escalated with name-calling and blocking, their initial reaction - being offended by a disability joke - was understandable. The author's choice to double down with more edgy content rather than show empathy, even knowing they share similar experiences with disability, was problematic.

The author's own disability doesn't give them license to make jokes that hurt others in the disability community, and their response showed a lack of consideration for how their words affected someone else. However, the other person's escalation to personal attacks wasn't constructive either.

When the homeless man became disruptive, refused to leave, and then physically struck the author, the author responded with minimal necessary force to remove him from the premises. The author's desire to reinstate the ban after being assaulted seems reasonable and professional.

The homeless man, despite his circumstances, crossed clear lines by refusing to leave when asked, becoming disruptive near an open restaurant, and most importantly, physically assaulting the security guard. Age and housing status don't excuse assault.

The team leader made a questionable decision to lift the original ban without consulting the night shift security who actually deals with these situations, then called the author ""harsh"" and an ""asshole"" for wanting protection after being assaulted at work.

The on-call person seems to have created confusion by promising cigarettes to the homeless man, though this appears to be a minor contributing factor.

While I have sympathy for the homeless man's situation, his actions - particularly the physical assault - were unacceptable regardless of his circumstances. The author was doing their job professionally and has a right to workplace safety.

In most grocery stores, the standard expectation is that customers unload their own items from baskets or carts onto the conveyor belt. This is considered basic courtesy - the cashier's job is to scan items and process payment, not to unload customers' shopping containers. By consistently placing your basket on the belt without unloading it, you've been creating extra work for cashiers and potentially slowing down the checkout process.

However, the cashier's response was also unprofessional. While she had legitimate reason to be frustrated, giving dirty looks, glaring, and pointedly ignoring you while chatting with other customers was inappropriate workplace behavior. A simple polite request like ""Could you please unload your basket?"" would have been the professional approach.

That said, the core issue here is that you've been unknowingly violating a widely understood social norm for years. The cashier's frustration, while poorly expressed, was understandable given that you were making her job harder.

The author was rejected in November, moved on appropriately while maintaining friendship, then developed feelings for a different person during the holidays (roughly 1-2 months later) and asked them out. This is completely normal human behavior - people can develop romantic interest in different people at different times, and there's no prescribed waiting period after rejection.

The criticism from the friend group seems to be based on an unrealistic expectation that romantic feelings should follow some arbitrary timeline or that asking out different people within a certain timeframe is somehow inappropriate. The author handled both situations respectfully - accepting rejections gracefully and maintaining friendships.

The other people (the friend group) are creating drama and judgment over perfectly normal dating behavior. They're essentially policing the author's romantic life based on their own arbitrary standards of how fast feelings should ""change.""

The author is being considerate of both their own health and their pet's needs. Air quality at this level poses real health risks to both humans and animals. The dog's disappointed expression is understandable but doesn't create a moral obligation for the owner to risk their health in dangerous conditions.

The author is dealing with legitimate frustration about their sister's relationship choices and the timing of the pregnancy affecting their wedding plans. However, their response - kicking their sister out of the wedding because she's pregnant and due around the wedding date - is disproportionate and hurtful. While the author acknowledges saying regrettable things, they're primarily focused on how this affects their wedding rather than supporting their sister during what's likely a difficult time.

The sister, while making questionable relationship choices that concern the family, hasn't actually done anything malicious toward the author. Getting pregnant wasn't done to spite the author or ruin their wedding - it's just unfortunate timing. The sister's silence after being kicked out of the wedding seems like a reasonable response to being hurt.

The author is treating their sister's pregnancy as a personal attack on their wedding, which is taking the situation too personally.

While it's understandable to notice changes in personal organization systems, jumping to conclusions about snooping without any direct evidence or conversation is problematic.

There are many innocent explanations for how socks could get mixed up - the girlfriend might have been doing laundry as a helpful gesture, looking for something the author asked her to find, or there could be other explanations entirely. The author admits they ""obviously can't prove anything"" but is still assuming the worst intentions.

The boyfriend is in a workplace situation where gift-giving appears to be normal among colleagues. However, the context matters significantly here. Both women have displayed clear romantic interest - one has openly hit on him and made inappropriate comments about hiring him for his looks, while the other regularly compares her fiancé unfavorably to him. The boyfriend acknowledges these romantic feelings exist.

The author's concerns are reasonable given this context. She's not objecting to normal workplace friendships or gift exchanges, but specifically to gift-giving with women who have romantic feelings for her boyfriend. Her discomfort with him spending significant time with these women, knowing their feelings, is also understandable from a relationship perspective.

However, the boyfriend seems to be trying to navigate workplace relationships professionally while perhaps being somewhat naive about the implications. His reasoning (feeling obligated due to Girl 1's gift, wanting to get Girl 2 something nicer because they work closely together) suggests he may be genuinely trying to maintain professional relationships rather than encourage romantic interest.

The author's request isn't unreasonable, but demanding he not give any gifts at all might be too controlling if gift-giving is a workplace norm. A better approach might be discussing appropriate boundaries and gift types.

This seems like a situation where both parties have valid concerns but could handle it better through communication about boundaries rather than ultimatums.

Both parties are engaging in harmful behaviors - the friend through theft and manipulation, and the author through verbal aggression and gossip.

The mother initially presented herself as supportive, explicitly telling her daughter she wanted her to be safe and offering to cover birth control through insurance. She even shared her own experience using contraception early in marriage. However, once the daughter took her up on this offer, the mother began lecturing about STDs, making religiously-based arguments about contraception being equivalent to abortion, prying for details about sexual partners, and getting angry when the daughter maintained reasonable boundaries.

The daughter has been respectful throughout - she reflected on her decision, communicated appropriately with her mother, listened to medical advice preferences, but reasonably refused to divulge private information about her sexual partners. She's a legal adult making responsible healthcare decisions.

While the mother may have good intentions rooted in concern, her approach constitutes a bait-and-switch. She offered support and coverage, then used that as leverage to lecture, judge, and attempt to control her adult daughter's private life. The daughter is being responsible by seeking contraception and maintaining appropriate boundaries about her personal relationships.

The author is feeling uncomfortable about his new girlfriend's social media posts featuring her ex-boyfriend from a previous relationship. He's considering asking her to remove these posts. The girlfriend has already explained that she doesn't have feelings for her ex but considers those posts part of her life history that she chooses not to delete.

The author's feelings are understandable - it's natural to feel some discomfort when dating someone whose social media prominently features a recent ex. However, asking someone to delete their social media history after only a couple weeks of dating would be overstepping boundaries. These posts represent her past experiences and memories, and she has the right to maintain her social media as she sees fit.

The girlfriend has been transparent about her feelings and provided a reasonable explanation. She's not doing anything wrong by keeping posts that document a significant period of her life.

The friends making comments about the ex's photos are perhaps being a bit tactless, but this seems more like normal social curiosity than malicious behavior.

The father's intentions may have been good - wanting to help his son - but the execution was problematic. Ambushing a shy 16-year-old with unsolicited advice about masculinity and dating, especially with another sibling present, was likely to make him feel embarrassed and defensive. The approach of comparing him unfavorably to his siblings and suggesting he needs to ""be more of a man"" was insensitive to his personality and interests.

However, the 16-year-old's response of telling his father to ""fuck off"" and calling him an ""asshole"" was disrespectful and inappropriate, regardless of how uncomfortable or angry he felt. There were better ways to express his feelings or remove himself from the situation.

The father's escalation after being cursed at - screaming, name-calling (""little shit""), and taking away the video games - was an overreaction that made the situation worse.

The author went along with the ambush without questioning whether this was the right approach, and while they express some regret about the video games being taken away, they still seem to support the overall confrontational method.

The author was using the computer for work and light browsing, which is normal behavior. When confronted with an accusatory question and demand to see browsing history, they asserted their right to privacy by refusing the inspection. Privacy in a relationship, especially regarding personal browsing history, is generally considered reasonable.

The girlfriend's behavior is more problematic. She immediately assumed wrongdoing (""wasting time""), demanded to inspect private browsing history without any evidence of actual problems, and when refused, used emotional manipulation (""You know I have trust issues!"") to try to get her way. Having trust issues doesn't justify violating a partner's reasonable privacy boundaries, especially when there's no history of actual problems in the relationship.

This kind of guilt-tripping and name-calling crosses a line, even when someone is disappointed or uncomfortable.

Both parties could have handled this better - the author could have offered alternative ways to help, and the pregnant partner could have accepted the boundary more gracefully.

This escalates the conflict unnecessarily and could be hurtful regardless of someone's actual financial situation.

The SO apologizing for the ""poor"" comment shows he recognized it was inappropriate, which suggests he was trying to maintain a civil co-parenting relationship. While the author might have wanted support, the comment itself was indefensible.

The baby mama's name-calling and aggressive behavior also contributed to the toxic dynamic, but the ""poor"" comment was a deliberate escalation that moved away from the legitimate concern about missing clothes.

The person spreading false rumors about having sex with your girlfriend is clearly engaging in harmful behavior that could damage your relationship and your girlfriend's reputation. That's unacceptable.

The author spent $20 (which is significant money for their financially struggling family) on a thoughtful Christmas gift for their best friend. The friend accepted the gift graciously and seemed to appreciate it. However, the friend then listed the unworn shirt for sale online, which the author discovered.

From the author's perspective, this feels like a betrayal of the thoughtful gesture and financial sacrifice they made. From the friend's perspective, once a gift is given, it typically becomes the recipient's property to do with as they choose - even if that choice might hurt the giver's feelings.

The key issue here is whether wanting the gift back makes the author an asshole. While the author's hurt feelings are completely understandable, demanding a gift back after it's been given crosses a social boundary. Gifts, once given, belong to the recipient. The friend's decision to sell it, while potentially insensitive, is technically within their rights.

The author initially acted appropriately by complimenting the child's costume and trying to engage positively. However, when the situation became uncomfortable, the author asked the child to leave multiple times and eventually walked away - these were reasonable responses to unwanted behavior.

The critical issue is the author's decision to physically assault the child. Even without knowing about the child's disability, hitting a child who was making noises and trying to ""scare"" (what the child likely thought was playful interaction) is completely unacceptable. The author ""lost control"" and ""beat him up,"" landing ""fists on his face and body."" This is a severe overreaction to what was essentially annoying but harmless behavior from a child.

While the child's behavior was persistent and bothersome, children - especially those with developmental disabilities - often don't understand social cues about when to stop. The child was likely trying to engage in what he thought was fun, playful interaction and didn't understand the author's discomfort.

The author's lack of knowledge about the child's condition doesn't excuse the violence. Adults are expected to exercise self-control and find non-violent solutions when dealing with children's behavior, regardless of how frustrating it might be.

The author was positioned strategically in a spot that provides stability and comfort for their longer journey, which is reasonable transit behavior. They mention they do move when there are significant numbers of people getting on/off, showing general consideration for others.

The key facts are:
- Only 2 people total were getting off at this station
- There was a clear second lane available for exit
- The other passenger could have easily used the alternative path
- Instead, this person chose to verbally insult the author and then physically push them

While there's always some gray area in transit etiquette about when to move, the other passenger's response was completely disproportionate and inappropriate. Calling someone names and physically pushing them over a minor inconvenience when an alternative was readily available crosses the line into unacceptable behavior.

The author's position wasn't unreasonable given the light passenger load and available alternatives, and even if it was slightly inconsiderate, it certainly didn't warrant verbal abuse and physical contact.

Susan...",Author,Author,0.72,0.7777777777777778,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the author's intentions versus their execution, and whether their friend's reaction was reasonable.

The author clearly cares about their friend and has legitimate concerns about a 19-year-old with self-destructive tendencies getting engaged after only 6 months of dating. These are valid worries that a good friend might have. However, the way they handled the situation was problematic.

Laughing at the announcement and immediately calling it ""one of the biggest mistakes she's ever made"" was hurtful and insensitive, even if well-intentioned. When someone shares important news, the appropriate response is to be supportive in the moment, even if you have private concerns. The author could have congratulated her initially and then found a more tactful way to express concerns later if needed.

That said, the author did recognize their mistake, apologized during the conversation, clarified their intentions, and followed up with additional apologies. They showed genuine remorse and tried to make things right.

Susan's hurt feelings and decision to end the evening early were completely understandable given how her announcement was received. However, not answering follow-up calls seems like a reasonable boundary rather than vindictive behavior.

While the author made a significant social misstep in their initial reaction, their genuine care for their friend, immediate recognition of the mistake, and efforts to apologize show they weren't maliciously intended to hurt Susan.

The author has clearly and repeatedly communicated a boundary - they don't want their partner to do this specific physical action. Despite multiple requests to stop, the partner continues the behavior. When confronted, the partner:
1. Dismisses it as ""such a small thing""
2. Gets angry at the author for being upset
3. Blames the author for ""ruining Valentine's Day""
4. Shows no genuine accountability beyond surface-level apologies

This pattern shows a concerning disregard for consent and boundaries. The partner's response of minimizing the author's feelings and turning themselves into the victim is particularly problematic. The author's reaction - feeling upset about repeated boundary violations and questioning why they continue - is completely reasonable and justified.

The author has done nothing wrong by setting boundaries, communicating them clearly, and being upset when those boundaries are repeatedly ignored. They are not overreacting or being unreasonable.

The author went through their boyfriend's phone without permission and made accusations of cheating, which violates privacy and trust in the relationship.

However, the boyfriend's response was completely disproportionate and illegal. He:
- Physically grabbed the author
- Pushed them hard enough to knock them down
- Destroyed expensive property (textbooks, laptop) by throwing them in a river
- Stole important documents and cards
- Likely destroyed the author's phone and took their car keys

While going through someone's phone is wrong, it absolutely does not justify physical violence, destruction of property, or theft of important documents. The boyfriend's actions constitute assault, theft, and destruction of property - serious crimes that put the author in physical danger and caused significant harm.

The author's decision to press charges and file a restraining order is a reasonable response to protect themselves from someone who has demonstrated they will respond to relationship conflicts with violence and destructive behavior.

The boyfriend's actions are so severe and illegal that they far outweigh the author's initial wrongdoing.

The author was trying to protect someone who appeared to be in a vulnerable state - heavily intoxicated and being touched without consent by a stranger. The author's intention was clearly to help, and they tried multiple approaches (getting the girl's attention first, then physically intervening when that didn't work).

However, the execution was flawed. Grabbing someone in heels on an elevated surface created a dangerous situation that resulted in injury. The author could have sought help from security, bar staff, or tried other methods before physical intervention.

The drunk girl, while a victim of unwanted touching, was too intoxicated to consent or be aware of her situation, which isn't her fault.

The man who was touching her without consent was clearly behaving inappropriately and potentially criminally.

The bystanders who later blamed the author seem to have missed the context of what was happening with the inappropriate touching.

While the author's method was imperfect and led to an unfortunate outcome, their core intention was to protect someone from sexual assault. The real wrongdoing here was the man's inappropriate behavior. The author made a judgment call in a difficult situation where someone appeared to be in danger.

The author acknowledges that their girlfriend and friends aren't wrong to be afraid of rape and assault, but criticizes them for ""dwelling"" on these fears and suggests they're choosing to be afraid. However, this perspective demonstrates a significant lack of understanding about the reality of women's safety concerns.

The behaviors the author describes - being cautious about walking alone, locking doors, being wary of certain men - are not irrational fears or ""dwelling on worst case scenarios."" These are reasonable safety precautions that many women take based on statistical realities and lived experiences. The author's suggestion that people can simply ""choose"" not to be afraid oversimplifies complex safety concerns and dismisses legitimate experiences.

While the author may have good intentions in wanting their loved ones to feel less anxious, their approach of minimizing these concerns and suggesting the women are at fault for their own fear is problematic. The real issue isn't that women are ""choosing"" to be afraid - it's that they're responding rationally to genuine safety risks in society.

The author is demonstrating a lack of empathy and understanding about women's safety experiences, making them primarily at fault for their dismissive attitude toward legitimate concerns.

The author experienced truly devastating events in rapid succession - losing their grandmother, nearly dying in a fire, becoming homeless, and losing their belongings and possibly a pet. They were dealing with trauma, grief, and displacement while still trying to maintain some normalcy by attending school.

When friends repeatedly asked ""how are you doing"" after being fully informed of these catastrophic events, the author had a very mild outburst - simply raising their voice slightly to point out the obvious fact that they weren't okay. This is an incredibly restrained response given the circumstances.

The friends' reaction was disproportionate and lacking in empathy. They gave the author the silent treatment, confronted them as a group, and demanded an apology for what was essentially a traumatized teenager having a very minor emotional response to repeated questioning about their obvious distress. Rather than showing understanding for someone going through multiple traumas, they made the situation about their own hurt feelings and added more stress to an already overwhelmed person.

While the author did apologize (showing maturity and conflict-avoidance), their friends failed to demonstrate basic compassion and emotional intelligence in handling a friend's crisis.

However, ...",Other,Other,0.75,0.6666666666666666,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives of all parties involved.

The group of friends repeatedly went to one person's house night after night for 5 days straight, staying very late (past 2am) even on school/work nights. This would understandably disrupt a household with middle/high school students who need sleep. The stepmother's request to stop coming over so frequently seems entirely reasonable given the circumstances.

The author shows self-awareness by recognizing that going to someone's house ""2 nights in a row let alone a whole week"" would be too much, and acknowledges they were likely bothering the younger siblings with their late-night visits. This demonstrates good judgment about appropriate boundaries.

However, the friend whose house they were using shows poor judgment by calling his stepmother a ""demon"" for setting reasonable household boundaries and thinking it's ""totally reasonable"" for the group to hang out there as much as they want, without considering the impact on his family.

The group as a whole was inconsiderate for repeatedly imposing on one household and staying so late on school nights, but the author specifically recognizes this was problematic behavior.

The author was in a difficult position when his cousins made racist comments about potential children having a ""shit-like complexion."" His intention was to defuse the situation, which shows he recognized the comments were inappropriate. However, his method - making a joke calling his girlfriend ""burnt"" - was deeply problematic for several reasons:

1. He amplified the racist commentary rather than shutting it down
2. He failed to understand the power dynamics and historical context of colorism that his girlfriend explained
3. When she tried to educate him about why his comment was harmful, he became defensive and made false equivalencies between her lighthearted memes about ""white people spicy food"" and his comment that reinforced harmful stereotypes about skin color
4. He dismissed her valid concerns about colorism and discrimination

While the cousins were clearly the instigators with their overtly racist comments, the author's response and subsequent defensiveness when confronted about the harm he caused makes him significantly at fault. His girlfriend's reaction was completely justified given the hurtful nature of his comment and his failure to understand why it was wrong.

The author initially borrowed clothes without asking when they had nothing, which established a pattern. However, they mention asking for important items and that their friend ""never seemed to mind."" When the friend started doing the same thing back, the author was initially okay with it.

The problem escalated when the friend began taking newly purchased items, favorite shoes (wearing them out), and makeup without asking - going beyond the informal arrangement they had established. The author feels unable to speak up due to feeling indebted to the friend's family for housing them during a crisis.

While the author did start the pattern of borrowing without asking, they were in an emergency situation as a minor with nothing to wear. The friend's family took them in, which created an unequal power dynamic. The friend then escalated the behavior by taking new purchases and personal items like makeup, and damaged the author's favorite shoes.

The author is trying to address this by communicating their feelings, which is the appropriate response. The friend appears to be taking advantage of the author's vulnerable position and gratitude.

The author has legitimate parental rights that are being unreasonably restricted. After 2+ years of being present and seeing his daughter 4-5 times per week, he should be able to have independent time with his child. The mother's concerns, while understandable from a protective standpoint, appear excessive given that:

1. He's been consistently involved and present
2. He's done nothing to warrant such extreme distrust
3. The pool concern, while valid, can be addressed through reasonable safety measures
4. Being ""forgetful"" with keys/wallet doesn't equate to being negligent with a child

However, the mother's behavior, while overprotective, seems to stem from genuine (if irrational) fear rather than malice. Her 24/7 presence with the child and work situation suggest she may have developed her own attachment issues.

The author's decision to file for custody without discussion wasn't ideal, but it appears to be a last resort after years of unsuccessful conversations and reasonable attempts to resolve the situation. Sometimes legal intervention becomes necessary when one parent unreasonably restricts the other's access.

The child's separation anxiety is concerning but is likely a result of the current arrangement rather than a reason to maintain it. Gradual, supervised transitions would be healthier long-term.

While the author could have handled the legal filing more transparently, the core issue is the mother's unreasonable restriction of his parental rights.

The author had lingering feelings for Jack but handled them maturely - accepting the situation, maintaining appropriate boundaries, and not acting on those feelings. When Chris asked her out, she declined partly due to these feelings and the awkwardness of dating within the friend group, which shows self-awareness and consideration for group dynamics.

The key issue is that Jack repeatedly badgered her for weeks about why she wouldn't date Chris, despite her giving polite excuses. She only revealed her feelings after persistent questioning, explicitly stating she wasn't expecting anything and that it was her personal issue to manage.

Jack's reaction seems disproportionate. While it might feel uncomfortable to learn about someone's feelings, his anger at being told something he repeatedly demanded to know suggests he bears significant responsibility. He created the pressure for this revelation through his persistent questioning, then blamed her for the discomfort of receiving the answer he insisted on hearing.

The author acknowledges they were ""kind of an asshole"" during their previous falling out and takes responsibility for not reacting ""in a way a friend should have."" They've apparently grown as a person since then and are enjoying reconnecting with these people unknowingly.

However, the core issue is whether it's ethical to maintain friendships under false pretenses, even if the deception is by omission. The former friends have a right to make informed decisions about who they associate with. By not revealing their identity, the author is denying these people the agency to decide whether they want to rebuild that relationship or maintain boundaries.

While the author's desire for friendship and personal growth is understandable, and while people can genuinely change, the foundation of any healthy relationship should be honesty. The longer this deception continues, the more problematic it becomes, and the greater the potential hurt when the truth inevitably comes out.

The author describes a breakdown in friendship where N and D allegedly treated her boyfriend poorly, made hypocritical demands about household responsibilities, and told her she was ""too good for him."" After moving out, the author was willing to give N another chance as a friend but set boundaries - N could dislike the partner but needed to keep negative thoughts to herself, and N wouldn't be welcome in their home because the partner wasn't comfortable with it.

The author's approach seems reasonable - she's trying to balance maintaining a friendship while respecting her partner's comfort in his own home. Setting boundaries after conflict is appropriate, and both people who pay rent should have input on who enters their shared living space.

The wider friend group calling the author an ""ass"" for not inviting N to hangouts at her house seems unfair, as they weren't involved in the original conflict and may not understand the full context of what happened during the sharehousing period.

A few y...",Other,Nobody,0.72,0.40669856459330145,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the fairness of the grandmother's gift distribution and the author's response to the significant value disparity.

The grandmother gave what she believed were equivalent sentimental gifts to all grandchildren - she had no knowledge of the monetary value difference and was acting with good intentions to treat everyone equally. The fact that one item turned out to be worth $75,000 while others had no monetary value was completely unintentional.

The author's suggestion that their son share half the value with his sister if he sells the item shows an attempt to address the unfair outcome. However, the author is essentially trying to override their mother's gift-giving decisions and redistribute wealth that legally belongs to their son. While the intention is good, they're inserting themselves into a situation where they don't have the authority to make such demands.

The son's reluctance is understandable - he received a gift that is legally his, and while his reasoning about income differences isn't particularly noble, he's not obligated to share his inheritance.

The daughter appears to have done nothing wrong and is simply the victim of an unfortunate circumstance.

This seems like a situation where good intentions from multiple parties have created an awkward dilemma, but no one has acted with malicious intent or clear wrongdoing.

My gf did not want me to go with the friend because I drunkenly hooked up...,Nobody,Author,0.72,0.5,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives and reasonableness of all parties involved.

The author's girlfriend has expressed discomfort with him going on a trip with someone he previously hooked up with, even though it was before their relationship. This is a fairly common and understandable boundary in relationships - many people would feel uncomfortable with their partner going on an extended trip alone with a former hookup, regardless of current relationship statuses or claimed lack of feelings.

The author acknowledges his girlfriend's concerns but decides to go anyway, which suggests he's prioritizing the trip over his girlfriend's comfort and the health of their relationship. While he has the right to make his own decisions, in a committed relationship, it's generally expected that partners consider each other's reasonable concerns about situations that could create jealousy or insecurity.

The girlfriend's request seems reasonable given the history, and her discomfort is understandable. The author choosing to dismiss these concerns and go anyway shows a lack of consideration for his partner's feelings.

The author is experiencing a natural shift in their feelings toward a friend - they were initially attracted to her appearance, but after she changed her hairstyle, they're no longer physically attracted and are now noticing personality incompatibilities they hadn't focused on before. They're realizing the friendship may have been sustained more by attraction than genuine compatibility.

Importantly, the author:
- Didn't criticize her hair choice or make her feel bad about it
- Recognizes she's a nice person, not calling her names
- Plans to distance themselves rather than ghost her completely
- Is being honest about their own shallow motivations

While it might seem shallow that physical attraction was masking personality differences, people can't control what they're attracted to or what interests them in conversation. The author isn't being cruel or manipulative - they're recognizing an incompatibility and planning to handle it by naturally distancing themselves rather than continuing a friendship they no longer enjoy or being dishonest about their feelings.

This appears to be a case where someone is having a realization about the nature of their friendship and choosing to handle it in a relatively mature way.

The girlfriend:
- Went through his text messages without permission (violation of privacy)
- Had been cheating on him with a coworker (major betrayal)
- Her cheating is a much more serious breach of trust than his omission

While the author's decision to hide the hangout wasn't ideal and shows some fault, the girlfriend's actions are significantly worse - both the invasion of privacy and especially the actual cheating. The author's deception was about an innocent social interaction, while the girlfriend was engaged in actual infidelity.

The author explicitly asked for honest feedback multiple times and emphasized how much they hate being lied to. However, there are several possibilities here:

1. The friend genuinely liked the story but has different taste/standards than the professor
2. The friend was trying to be supportive but gave overly positive feedback
3. The professor and friend were evaluating different aspects or had different criteria
4. The friend was being dishonest to spare feelings despite being asked for honesty

The key issue is that the author made their need for honesty crystal clear, repeatedly asked for brutal honesty, and specifically said they'd rather scrap the work than submit something bad. The friend knew lying was the author's biggest trigger.

Even if the friend had good intentions or genuinely liked the story, they failed to provide the kind of critical, honest feedback the author explicitly requested. When someone repeatedly asks for harsh honesty about something important to them, and you know they value truth above all else, you have a responsibility to either give that honest assessment or decline to review it.

The author's reaction seems proportionate given their clearly stated boundaries about honesty and the consequences of the misleading feedback.

The author's former friend made a move on his girlfriend while she was blackout drunk and he was more sober - this shows poor judgment and a violation of trust. The pattern of similar behavior with other friends' girlfriends and lack of impulse control suggests this wasn't an isolated incident. The author has every right to set boundaries about who they want in their life, especially after such a betrayal.

The girlfriend was heavily intoxicated to the point of being ""blackout,"" which significantly impairs judgment and consent capacity. While being drunk doesn't excuse all behavior, her level of incapacitation is a mitigating factor.

The author has handled this maturely - giving his girlfriend another chance after she demonstrated changed behavior, clearly communicating his boundaries to his former friend, and being willing to compromise for important events. He's not demanding others cut contact or creating drama for the friend group.

The friend group and former friend seem to be pushing for reconciliation without fully acknowledging the severity of the betrayal or respecting the author's reasonable boundaries.

The author is being reasonable in choosing not to maintain a friendship with someone who violated his trust in such a significant way, especially given the pattern of similar behavior. Setting boundaries after betrayal is healthy and appropriate.

The author acknowledges several key points:
- The aunt is ""very generous"" and spent around $1,000
- The gift is ""very nice"" 
- They do use the vase
- They appreciate the aunt's rationale
- The aunt was being thoughtful in her own way (""everyone needs to have a set of Waterford"")

The author's frustration stems from the practical reality that the crystal glasses don't fit their lifestyle - they're too fragile for regular use, require hand-washing, and can't be used for entertaining due to breakage concerns. They would have preferred something from their registry that they'd actually use.

However, the aunt gave what she genuinely believed was a meaningful, high-quality gift based on her own values and experience. She wasn't being malicious or thoughtless - she was sharing something she considered essential for a proper home.

While it's natural to feel some disappointment when a gift doesn't match your needs or preferences, being ""annoyed"" at someone's generous gesture crosses into ungrateful territory. The author is focusing more on what they didn't get rather than appreciating the thought and expense that went into what they did receive.

The renter is clearly neglecting their dog - leaving it kenneled for hours causing distress, leaving it outside in cold weather without shelter after a haircut that removes its natural insulation, never walking or properly caring for it, and then demanding the landlords fix a gate issue while making threats. This is poor pet ownership and inappropriate tenant behavior.

However, the author (landlord) is knowingly allowing animal neglect to continue on their property. While they've ""mentioned"" the kenneling issue, they haven't taken meaningful action despite witnessing ongoing animal welfare concerns. They're also deliberately delaying fixing a safety issue (the gate) that could result in the dog being lost or injured, even though they acknowledge wanting the dog to be safe.

The author does have some valid points about tenant responsibilities and the purpose of pet deposits. But their passive approach to obvious animal neglect and intentional delay in addressing a safety concern that affects a living creature makes them partially culpable.

Both parties are failing the dog - the renter through active neglect and the landlord through passive enablement and deliberate inaction on safety measures.

The 15-year-old author was insensitive in telling their crying sister to ""get a grip"" when she was hurt about being excluded from their grandfather's gift-giving year after year. While the sister's exclusion is painful and the author may have been frustrated by the recurring drama, dismissing someone's hurt feelings so harshly was unkind.

However, the mother's response was also problematic. Taking half of the author's gift money to give to the sister essentially punishes the author for their grandfather's choices and creates resentment. The money was specifically given to the author by their grandfather, and redistributing it without the gift-giver's consent undermines that relationship.

The sister, while understandably hurt by the grandfather's consistent exclusion, does seem to create drama about this predictable situation every year rather than finding healthier ways to cope.

The grandfather's pattern of excluding one grandchild year after year is the root cause of this family conflict, though he's not directly involved in this particular incident.

The author is being practical about their living situation - they acknowledge they lead hectic lives, are rarely home, live in a city without a backyard, and that the dog currently has a better quality of life with retired parents in the country. These are legitimate concerns about the dog's welfare.

The girlfriend wants her dog back, which is understandable as an emotional attachment, and she believes having the dog would motivate her to be home more. However, she's angry that her partner won't even try a trial period, and her reasoning seems somewhat idealistic rather than practical.

The author's concerns appear well-founded and focused on what's best for the dog's welfare, while also being realistic about their current lifestyle constraints. The girlfriend's anger over not getting a trial period seems unreasonable given the valid concerns raised, and her belief that the dog would automatically make her change her lifestyle patterns may be overly optimistic.

Neither party is being malicious, but the girlfriend's insistence and anger over a reasonable position makes her slightly more at fault for not accepting valid practical concerns.

The author's behavior: She snooped through his private browsing history and online accounts without permission - a clear violation of privacy. More concerning, she's now considering asking him to give up or reduce a harmless hobby simply because it doesn't align with her preferences for ""masculinity"" and ""maturity."" She's essentially trying to control his interests based on her own biases and stereotypes.

The author is attempting to police her partner's completely harmless personal interests while having violated his privacy to discover them in the first place.

The author appears to have chosen the name innocuously, likely based on the cat's appearance or simply liking the sound of the name. There's no indication of malicious intent or deliberate cultural insensitivity. The name ""Moo Shu"" (or Mu Shu) refers to a legitimate Chinese dish, and naming pets after foods is extremely common and generally accepted.

The girlfriend's concern about racism seems to stem from sensitivity about cultural appropriation, but naming a pet after a food dish - even one from another culture - doesn't rise to the level of racism. Many pets are named after foods from various cultures (Sushi, Nacho, Biscotti, etc.) without it being considered offensive.

The author is now in a difficult position because the cat has already bonded with the name, and changing it could be confusing for the animal. The girlfriend's reaction, while perhaps well-intentioned, appears to be an overreach in labeling this as racist behavior.

This seems to be a case where different perspectives on cultural sensitivity have created conflict, but the author's action of naming their pet after a food dish doesn't constitute wrongdoing.

The author waited 40 minutes, expressed their frustration about being stood up again, and left when they felt the friend was being manipulative rather than taking responsibility. While the author could have handled it more diplomatically, their core complaint about chronic lateness and lack of apology is legitimate.

The author is in a genuinely difficult position. She's found someone she really connects with and wants to explore the relationship, but is facing harsh judgment from colleagues and even family members. The comments she's receiving are inappropriate, sexist, and hurtful - ranging from assumptions about gold-digging to crude sexual rumors.

However, the author is contemplating ending what she describes as an amazing relationship with someone who has ""kindness,"" ""wonderful outlook on life,"" and genuine compatibility with her - not because of any issues with the relationship itself, but because of other people's perceptions and gossip.

While the workplace harassment and societal judgment she's facing is absolutely wrong and unfair, choosing to end a good relationship primarily because of what others think would be allowing those negative voices to control her personal happiness and life choices. The author acknowledges this herself when she asks if she'd be wrong to let ""society beat her down.""

The author has been in a stable 8-year relationship and wants to take a solo trip to Europe for 7 weeks after losing her father to cancer.

Her boyfriend's supportive response shows maturity and trust in their relationship. The author's belief that non-codependent relationships are strongest is also sound relationship wisdom.

The friend, however, is imposing her own narrow views about relationships and making harmful, unsolicited judgments.

When given the honest answer she claimed to want, she became upset and punished the author for providing exactly what she demanded. This creates an impossible situation - she explicitly asked for honesty multiple times, then became angry when she received it.

While I understand the author's frustration and their point about listening to marginalized voices, shutting down dialogue based on someone's identity rather than addressing their poor arguments directly was counterproductive. The author even acknowledges they don't actually believe people shouldn't be allowed opinions based on sexuality, suggesting they know this approach was flawed.

The friend, however, showed a pattern of irresponsibility:

Your sister is dealing with an extremely difficult emotional situation - having a father who committed murder, even under circumstances that weren't premeditated. Her back-and-forth between forgiveness and condemnation over decades shows she's genuinely struggling with conflicting feelings about maintaining a relationship with someone who took lives, regardless of the circumstances.

While I understand your frustration about the planned visit falling through, your sister has legitimate reasons for her decision. She may be protecting her own mental health and making what she believes are appropriate parenting choices about exposing her children to this situation. The fact that she's wrestled with this for decades suggests this isn't a casual or spiteful decision.

You have every right to maintain your own relationship with your father and feel disappointed about the visit, but your sister also has the right to set boundaries about her and her children's involvement, even if those boundaries change over time as she processes her feelings.

The author clearly acknowledges significant wrongdoing - cheating with three different people despite knowing their partner had PTSD from previous infidelity, and even having professional knowledge that should have made them more aware of the impact. The cheating itself was a serious betrayal.

However, the ex-partner's response, while understandable given the hurt, included calling the author ""a bad person,"" saying other ""angry and hurtful words,"" and then blocking contact for months. Now the ex wants to reconcile for their own mental health and peace of mind.

The key question is whether the author has an obligation to participate in this reconciliation process. While the author caused the initial harm through cheating, they are not responsible for managing their ex's ongoing mental health issues or required to subject themselves to further interaction if they don't want to. The ex's current suicidal feelings, while concerning, are not the author's responsibility to fix through forced reconciliation.

The author seems to recognize their wrongdoing in the cheating but is setting reasonable boundaries about not being obligated to engage in reconciliation they don't want. Both parties have done wrong things, but the current conflict is about whether reconciliation is mandatory.

The author (Bison) is experiencing reasonable concerns about their girlfriend's relationship with her ex, especially given that mutual feelings still exist. However, the author hasn't done anything wrong - they've communicated their concerns appropriately with their girlfriend and haven't acted inappropriately toward the ex despite feeling uncomfortable.

The girlfriend (G) is in a difficult position but seems to be handling it reasonably well. She's being honest about the situation (telling the author about the mutual feelings) and providing reassurance. While maintaining a close friendship with an ex while in a new relationship can be problematic, she hasn't crossed clear boundaries based on the information provided.

The ex (X) appears to be overstepping boundaries by giving gifts and baking food for someone who is now in a relationship, especially when mutual feelings are acknowledged. However, X is also being kind to the author, which suggests they may not be intentionally trying to sabotage the relationship.

This seems like a complex emotional situation where people are navigating difficult feelings, but no one has committed clear wrongdoing. The author's concerns are valid, but they're handling them maturely. The situation is uncomfortable but doesn't appear to involve anyone being truly at fault.

The author had made arrangements in advance for a surprise gift, which the hotel offered to provide for free as a congratulatory gesture. When they arrived, the front desk agent had no record of this arrangement. While the author's disappointment is completely understandable, their response was problematic.

The author admits to being sarcastic ""several times"" and making it clear it wasn't ""ok"" in a way that created ""a bit of a scene."" The front desk agent apologized and offered to remedy the situation by bringing the items the next evening, which was a reasonable solution given the circumstances. However, the author chose to respond in a way that made the agent ""feel so bad"" and caused enough of a disturbance that their fiancé noticed and felt compelled to comment on it.

While the hotel made an error by not properly noting the arrangement, mistakes happen in service industries. The author's sarcastic and scene-making response was disproportionate to the situation, especially when the agent was trying to help fix the problem.

The author is a 17-year-old trying to lose weight and wanting family support, which is understandable. However, they're essentially asking their parents to change the entire household's food budget and eating habits to accommodate their personal weight loss goals. While the motivation to protect their younger brothers from potential bullying is well-intentioned, the author is placing responsibility on others for their own eating choices and weight management.

The parents have legitimate constraints - they're feeding a family of 5 on what appears to be a tight budget, and healthier foods can indeed be more expensive. The step-dad's concern about cost isn't unreasonable when managing a household budget. The parents aren't obligated to restructure their entire food purchasing and preparation around one family member's diet goals.

The author acknowledges being ""not very in control of my own eating"" and being ""pretty picky when it comes to healthy food,"" which suggests the primary issue is personal discipline and food choices rather than lack of family support. They also admit to giving in to temptation with the sweet tea.

While family support for healthy lifestyle changes is ideal, the author is essentially asking others to solve a problem that requires personal responsibility and self-control. The parents aren't being malicious - they're managing practical household constraints.

The girlfriend is doing intermittent fasting (12-8 eating window) and initially made a reasonable request for her partner not to eat around her during fasting hours. However, she then extended this to asking him not to cook at all during those hours due to the smell making her hungry.

The author is trying to be supportive - he agreed to the first request and attempted to accommodate the second by switching to cereal and oatmeal. However, he's struggling with giving up cooking breakfast (something he really enjoys) and late-night snacks in his own home.

The core issue is that the girlfriend's second request significantly restricts the author's ability to prepare food in his own living space for about 16 hours a day. While her struggle with hunger during fasting is understandable, expecting a partner to completely avoid cooking in a shared home for two-thirds of the day seems unreasonable. The author has made genuine efforts to compromise and accommodate her needs.

The girlfriend appears to be asking for accommodations that go beyond what's fair in a shared living situation, while the author has been trying to be supportive but is reasonably pushing back on an overly restrictive request.

You and Amy have been consistently taking on all the planning responsibilities - from choosing times, places, activities, and even initiating hangouts. When you finally asked Josh and Kate to plan something, they essentially just shifted the decision-making back to you with a list of restaurants and vague timing, which isn't really planning at all.

However, your sarcastic comment (""I'm sorry for asking yall to plan for once I guess that was too hard for yall"") was unnecessarily rude, even though you apologized for it later. Josh's response was also quite harsh and dismissive.

That said, the core issue here is about friendship equity. It's reasonable to want your friends to occasionally take initiative and put in effort to maintain the friendship. Some people are naturally more passive or less comfortable with planning, but completely relying on others to do all the work isn't fair in a balanced friendship.

The fact that you resolved it and are still good friends suggests this was more about communication styles and expectations than any malicious intent from anyone.

The author has legitimate sexual needs that aren't being met in the relationship, and he's tried to respect his girlfriend's boundaries around frequency. He's drawing what seems like a reasonable parallel between her solo toy use and his own. He's also been transparent about his purchase rather than hiding it.

However, the girlfriend's reaction, while emotionally understandable, seems inconsistent. She uses toys 3-4 times per week while limiting partnered sex to once weekly, and she objects to his porn use but hasn't explicitly forbidden it. Her demand that he get rid of an expensive purchase without discussion or compromise appears unreasonable, especially given her own frequent toy use.

The core issue seems to be a fundamental sexual incompatibility that neither party has adequately addressed. The girlfriend appears to be applying a double standard - her solo sexual activities are acceptable, but his are not. While sex dolls can understandably feel more threatening than other forms of masturbation to a partner, the principle of sexual autonomy should apply equally.

The author offered their friend a spare room as temporary help during a difficult time. This was a generous gesture to help someone in need. However, the friend brought two strangers into the author's home without asking permission first. This is problematic because:

1. The author has a family (wife, mother, and two children) living in the home, so safety and comfort of all residents is a legitimate concern
2. Bringing unknown guests into someone else's home without permission violates basic courtesy and respect
3. The arrangement was for the friend to stay temporarily, not to treat the space as his own apartment where he can host others

The author's discomfort with strangers in their family home is reasonable. While the ""no girls rule"" phrasing is awkward and could be better expressed as ""no overnight guests without permission,"" the underlying boundary is appropriate.

The friend should have asked permission before bringing anyone over, especially for what appears to be an overnight stay. This shows a lack of respect for the homeowner's generosity and family situation.

- Ignored persistent calls after expressing they weren't ready to schedule

The company's actions:

The friend's actions are clearly problematic and cross multiple boundaries:
- Attempting to kiss someone after being told they only want friendship

- Continuing unwanted romantic/sexual advances after being rejected
- Using derogatory language like ""little bitch""

The author (15-year-old):

- Tried to ignore the behavior rather than addressing it directly
- Eventually chose to cut contact, which is a reasonable response to persistent harassment

While the author could have been more direct in addressing the inappropriate behavior earlier, this doesn't make them at fault. A 15-year-old dealing with an older friend's sexual harassment shouldn't be expected to handle it perfectly.

2. Intercepting new donations before they even reached the bin
3. Claiming ownership of cards that were meant for community sharing

While the author's method of grabbing cards and walking away was somewhat confrontational, it appears to be a reasonable response to someone who was hoarding a community resource. The author was trying to restore the intended function of the bin - allowing multiple people to access the donated cards.

The parent is concerned about their 10-year-old daughter's habit of practicing unusual body movements and facial expressions, particularly covering her nostrils with her upper lip. While the parent expresses love for their daughter and acknowledges her intelligence and creativity, they're trying to control and punish her for these harmless self-expressions because they find them ""ugly"" and see no ""positive benefits.""

The child is simply exploring her body's capabilities and practicing skills that interest her - this is normal developmental behavior. She's not harming anyone or being disruptive beyond asking for attention (which is also normal for a 10-year-old). The parent's sister encourages the behavior, which creates additional family tension.

The core issue is that the parent is trying to control their child's harmless self-expression based on aesthetic preferences rather than any real concern for the child's wellbeing. Threatening punishment for facial expressions crosses into controlling territory that could damage the child's self-esteem and relationship with her parent. The parent acknowledges these activities aren't actually harmful but wants to stop them anyway because they don't find them attractive or useful.

Jack is clearly at fault for cheating on his wife, regardless of the circumstances that led to the marriage or his feelings for Hannah. Marriage creates obligations that he's violating.

Hannah, while having long-standing feelings, chose to engage in an affair with a married man. Even if she believes Jack will leave his wife, she's participating in infidelity.

Jasmine, while described as emotionally immature and having pushed for a relationship Jack wasn't ready for, didn't deserve to be cheated on. However, her manipulative behavior (trying to drive wedges, attempting to secretly move in, pressuring Jack into commitment) contributed to creating an unhealthy dynamic.

The author and friend group, while trying to stay out of the drama, seem to be somewhat enabling the situation by providing a venue where the affair could develop and by having a ""she had it coming"" attitude.

The author has clearly communicated their dietary preferences and health goals to their mother ""hundreds"" of times, specifically mentioning they don't want junk food like Chex Mix. They've been consistent in their message and have even tried giving the unwanted food away before resorting to throwing it out.

The mother, while likely well-intentioned in wanting to provide for her child, is repeatedly ignoring clearly stated boundaries about food preferences. Even accounting for her ""extremely bad memory,"" the pattern of giving the same unwanted items (like Chex Mix) every week suggests this goes beyond simple forgetfulness. The author mentions the mother ""really doesn't listen,"" which indicates a communication issue on the mother's part.

However, I don't see malicious intent from either party. The mother appears to be expressing care through food (a common parental behavior), while the author is trying to maintain their health. The core issue seems to be the mother's failure to respect clearly communicated boundaries, whether due to memory issues, not listening, or difficulty accepting her child's independence.

The author is being honest about their mixed motivations - they're concerned about both safety and potential damage to their first car. While they admit that concern about ""dinging up"" their car was their primary worry initially, they also have legitimate safety concerns about driving in snow with a 2000 Corolla.

The key factors here are:
1. The author owns the car and has the right to decide how it's used
2. They have valid safety concerns about driving in snow
3. While vanity about the car was a factor, it's understandable for someone with their first car
4. The other available vehicles have serious safety issues (non-functioning seatbelts, no airbags)
5. The author isn't refusing outright but expressing reasonable concerns

The father asking to borrow the ""nicer"" car initially seems to be about appearances rather than safety, though it turns out the author's car is actually the safest option. The author isn't being unreasonable in having concerns about lending their vehicle in hazardous conditions.

This appears to be a normal family discussion about logistics and safety rather than anyone being particularly at fault.

The author is upset about several things:
1. Their brother marrying someone primarily for immigration convenience
2. The couple's financial dependence on elderly grandparents
3. Their perception that the couple hasn't faced ""real"" relationship challenges
4. The brother expecting family to fund their European venture

While the author has legitimate concerns about the financial burden on elderly grandparents and the seemingly transactional nature of the marriage, their response seems disproportionate. They admit to personal bias against both the girlfriend and their brother, and they're considering skipping a family wedding over issues that don't directly affect them.

The brother and girlfriend are making questionable financial and relationship decisions, but adults have the right to make their own choices, even poor ones. The grandparents are apparently willing participants in supporting them financially.

The author's anger, while understandable, is leading them toward actions (boycotting the wedding) that would damage family relationships over matters that are ultimately not their business to control.

The ...",Author,Author,0.72,0.6956521739130435,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the complex dynamics of grief, family obligations, and emotional responses to tragedy.

The author is experiencing what appears to be emotional numbness or detachment following their brother's death - this could be a form of grief response, depression, or other psychological condition. While their lack of emotional response may seem unusual, people process trauma and loss differently, and this isn't inherently wrong or their fault.

However, the author's decision not to attend their brother's funeral - citing being ""busy"" rather than honestly explaining their emotional state - is causing additional pain to grieving family members. The father is begging them to come, and other family members are upset by what they perceive as callous indifference during a time of profound loss.

The family members are dealing with their own grief and naturally expect support from each other during this tragedy. Their upset reaction is understandable given the circumstances and the author's apparent dismissiveness.

While the author cannot control their emotional response to the tragedy, they could handle the situation with more consideration for their grieving family members, perhaps by being more honest about their emotional state or finding ways to support the family despite their own detachment.

This appears to be a situation where everyone is struggling with an extremely difficult circumstance, but the author's approach to handling family expectations during this crisis is problematic.

They also made an effort to return the TV to its original owner.

The friend moved out without notice, left belongings behind (including dangerous items), ignored repeated requests to collect the guns, and then demanded property back nearly a year later after complete radio silence about his possessions.

While there could be an argument that the author should have given more formal notice before disposing of the items, the friend's behavior was far more problematic - abandoning property for nearly a year, leaving firearms with someone uncomfortable having them, and providing no communication about his intentions for the items.

The author made a reasonable decision to pursue a career opportunity that unexpectedly became available. They had initially committed to summer plans with Ben only after believing the internship opportunity had fallen through completely (no responses for a month). When the internship opportunity surprisingly materialized, they chose their career development over recreational activities - a mature decision for a 14-year-old. They communicated the change to Ben promptly and explained their reasoning.

Ben's reaction, while disappointing, is understandable. He's a teenager who had summer plans with his friend fall through at the last minute. His comment about ""just pouring coffee"" shows some dismissiveness of the author's goals, but this seems more like typical teenage frustration than serious wrongdoing.

The professor was very late in responding (over a month), which created this timing conflict, but professors are busy and this delay, while inconvenient, doesn't constitute a moral failing.

This appears to be a case where circumstances created disappointment, but no one acted in a way that would make them ""at fault.""

The author's concerns about cultural appropriation and superficial incorporation of Hindu/Indian wedding traditions have some validity. As someone from that culture, they're witnessing what appears to be a ""pick and choose"" approach to sacred traditions without deep understanding. Their discomfort is understandable.

However, the author's approach was problematic. Telling someone they ""shouldn't have an Indian wedding"" is quite harsh, especially to an adopted person trying to connect with their birth culture. While Jenn's approach may be flawed, her desire to connect with her Indian heritage is legitimate, even if her understanding is limited. The author could have offered to help educate her or suggested ways to incorporate elements more respectfully, rather than essentially telling her she has no right to her own cultural heritage.

Jenn's reaction - breaking down, ending the friendship, and cutting off communication - seems disproportionate to receiving honest feedback from a friend, even if it was delivered bluntly. However, this touches on deeply personal issues of identity and belonging for an adopted person.

Both parties handled this poorly. The author was insensitive in their delivery, and Jenn overreacted to criticism, even if it stung.

(not the smartest ...,Author,Author,0.72,0.8,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the intentions versus the outcomes and whether the actions taken were reasonable.

The author and their friends had good intentions - they wanted to help their depressed friend who had been struggling with unrequited feelings for months. However, their method was problematic. DMing someone on behalf of another person without that person's consent is generally not appropriate, especially in romantic situations. This kind of interference can come across as immature or pushy to the recipient.

The girl's upset reaction was understandable - being contacted by a group of friends trying to orchestrate romantic contact would likely feel uncomfortable or manipulative to most people. The friend who liked the girl also seems to have been hurt by this well-intentioned but misguided intervention.

While the author acknowledges this ""wasn't the smartest idea"" and shows genuine remorse, the action itself was still a mistake that caused harm to both parties involved. The author took it upon themselves to interfere in someone else's romantic situation without permission, which crossed boundaries even if done with good intentions.

The road to problematic outcomes can be paved with good intentions, and in this case, the author's actions, while meant to help, were inappropriate and caused the very harm they were trying to prevent.

The author (25M) has:
- Been clear about his boundaries and sexual orientation from the start
- Given P. a second chance after inappropriate behavior
- Tried to address P.'s concerning behavior directly
- Been put in an uncomfortable position repeatedly, including in front of his girlfriend

P. (24M) has:
- Repeatedly ignored clearly stated boundaries
- Made unwanted romantic/sexual advances multiple times
- Used manipulative tactics (calling the author homophobic, seeking pity)
- Escalated inappropriate behavior in public settings
- Made the author so uncomfortable that strangers noticed
- Continued pursuing someone who has explicitly rejected him

The author is now considering going no-contact, which he acknowledges he normally wouldn't do, but feels it's necessary given P.'s pattern of manipulation and boundary violations.

While ghosting isn't ideal, the author has already tried direct communication multiple times without success. P. has shown a clear pattern of not respecting boundaries, manipulating situations, and making unwanted advances despite repeated rejections. The author has been patient and given multiple chances, but P.'s behavior has only escalated.

The author witnessed a drunk driving accident where the driver lost control and flipped their vehicle. When the drunk driver asked the author to lie and claim they were driving (to help the drunk driver avoid a DUI), the author refused this request, which was the right thing to do.

However, the author then helped the drunk driver leave the scene of an accident by giving them a ride away from the crash site. This is problematic because:

1. It helped someone evade responsibility for drunk driving and fleeing an accident scene
2. It potentially interfered with a police investigation
3. It enabled someone who had just demonstrated they're a danger on the roads to avoid consequences
4. The drunk driver should have remained at the scene to speak with police and take responsibility

While the author's initial response of refusing to lie was correct, and their concern for making sure no one was hurt was admirable, ultimately helping the drunk driver flee the scene was wrong. The author became complicit in helping someone evade legal consequences for dangerous behavior that could have killed people.

The drunk driver is clearly more at fault for driving under the influence and causing an accident, but the author bears some responsibility for their decision to aid in the escape.

The girlfriend asked direct questions about her appearance and specifically asked for suggestions on how she could look better. The author initially tried to avoid the topic and redirect to positive things about her, which shows some awareness that this was sensitive territory. However, when pressed further, he gave brutally honest answers that he knew would be hurtful.

While honesty in relationships is generally important, there's a significant difference between being truthful and being unnecessarily cruel. When someone asks ""how could I look better?"" they're typically seeking reassurance or maybe gentle, constructive feedback - not to be told they're a 5/10 and can never improve. The author seems to have missed the emotional subtext of these questions entirely.

The author's approach lacked basic emotional intelligence and empathy. Even if he genuinely believes these things, the way he communicated them was tactless and damaging. There were many ways to handle this situation that would have been both honest and kind - focusing on what he finds attractive about her, discussing that attraction isn't just physical, or even having a more nuanced conversation about the role of physical appearance in their relationship.

The girlfriend's questions, while putting him in a difficult position, seem to come from normal relationship insecurities rather than any malicious intent.

- Couldn't have predicted the weather emergency
- Participated in a fair raffle that was explicitly offered to the entire office
- Is showing genuine concern and guilt about the situation
- Won through random chance, not manipulation

- The vacation was properly approved in advance
- The raffle was conducted fairly with full knowledge of who was included

This appears to be an unfortunate coincidence where bad weather created a stressful situation while someone was on pre-approved leave. The author feels guilty due to natural empathy, but didn't do anything wrong by taking approved time off or participating in a raffle they were explicitly invited to join. The coworkers and boss also acted reasonably throughout.

Sometimes difficult situations arise from circumstances beyond anyone's control, and this seems to be one of those cases.

The friend explicitly asked to be roasted about his cancer ""as hard as they could without holding back."" The author initially resisted but eventually participated at the friend's insistence. However, the author's comment revealed devastating information that the friend hadn't considered - that he would likely lose mental function before dying. This caused genuine distress and ongoing sadness.

While the friend did ask for harsh roasting, there's a significant difference between dark humor and revealing genuinely traumatic medical realities that someone hasn't processed yet. The author could have declined to participate or found a way to ""roast"" without introducing new, devastating information about the friend's prognosis. The fact that this revelation has caused lasting distress suggests the author crossed a line, even within the requested context.

The author is a 21-year-old who has been financially independent since 18 and living away from home. Their parents have a history of financial struggles and relationship issues, and have been asking hypothetical questions about having another child for years. The author has consistently expressed that they think it would be unwise.

When the parents announced the pregnancy via video call, the author tried to hide their negative reaction during the call but is now taking a ""not my problem"" stance and considering distancing themselves from the situation.

The father's behavior is clearly problematic and dangerous - using reckless driving as an intimidation tactic puts everyone in the vehicle at serious risk and is a form of emotional abuse/manipulation. This has been going on for years and affects multiple family members.

However, the author's response of deliberately not wearing a seatbelt as a form of protest is also concerning. While I understand the frustration and desire to make a point about the father's dangerous behavior, intentionally increasing personal risk of serious injury or death is not a safe or effective way to address the problem. This approach could result in tragic consequences that go far beyond making a point.

The author is essentially engaging in a dangerous game of chicken, risking their own life to try to teach their father a lesson. While the motivation is understandable, this creates additional unnecessary risk in an already dangerous situation.

The author acknowledges they missed rent payments and had an agreement with their roommate to pay back what was owed. They thought they had paid everything back but discovered they still owe two months. However, they're now considering whether they should have to pay because the roommate's girlfriend has been living there rent-free since mid-2016.

The key issue is that these are two separate matters that were never formally connected:

1. The author's missed rent payments and agreement to pay them back
2. The girlfriend moving in without contributing to rent

The author never raised the rent redistribution issue when the girlfriend moved in, and continued to make payments under the original agreement for about two years. They can't retroactively decide that their debt should be forgiven because of an unrelated housing arrangement they never formally objected to.

While the author might have a valid point about rent redistribution going forward, using it to avoid paying back acknowledged debt feels like trying to escape responsibility rather than addressing the housing arrangement properly.

The author has clearly communicated their values about treating possessions carefully and wanting items to last long-term. They've explained that they research purchases thoroughly and expect longevity. The boyfriend, while well-intentioned in offering to replace anything that breaks, is missing the point - the author doesn't want their belongings damaged in the first place, regardless of replacement offers.

The author's request for the boyfriend to drive their car more carefully is entirely reasonable. It's their property, and they have every right to set expectations for how it should be treated. The boyfriend's approach of ""drive it hard and replace if needed"" might work for his own belongings, but applying this philosophy to someone else's carefully chosen possessions shows a lack of respect for their values and boundaries.

The boyfriend isn't malicious, but he's being inconsiderate by not adjusting his behavior to respect his partner's clearly stated preferences about their own belongings.

The aunt's behavior shows a clear pattern of manipulation, theft, and cruelty - taking advantage of the family's EBT card, making hurtful comments about the author's beloved cat, and ultimately being responsible for the cat going missing.

While addiction is a disease that deserves compassion, the author has endured years of disappointment, broken promises, and emotional neglect.

The author appears to have made these decisions after reaching adulthood and having time to reflect on these relationships.

The author acknowledges they have ""no rational argument"" for refusing to sign the name change application and admits they can't say they believe it would hurt their daughter.

The author has been refusing for ""a year or two"" based on a ""vague feeling"" that the daughter is too young, but this appears to be an emotional reaction rather than a reasoned position. A 9-year-old is certainly old enough to understand what having both parents' names means, especially when both parents are supportive of the change. The author's prolonged resistance seems to be causing unnecessary delay and potentially distress to their daughter who has expressed this desire.

The author acknowledges they sold cannabis to their 17-year-old cousin despite knowing the parents strongly disapprove of cannabis (they ""despise"" the business and cut contact over it). Even though the author had good intentions - wanting to help a stressed teenager - selling cannabis to a minor against explicit parental opposition crosses important legal and ethical lines. In most jurisdictions, this would be illegal regardless of the author's legitimate business.

The uncle and aunt's strong reaction, while perhaps extreme in cutting off family contact, is understandable given they discovered someone was selling drugs to their minor child against their wishes. The parents' anger is also justified - even though they support the author's business generally, selling to a minor family member against parental consent violates important boundaries.

While the family situation sounds difficult for the cousin, and the author's intentions were compassionate, good intentions don't excuse poor judgment in this case. The author should have found other ways to support their cousin or encouraged the family to seek proper help for the teenager's stress and depression.

The sister consistently insults the author daily for about a year, making hurtful comments about their weight and appearance. The parents enable this behavior by dismissing the author's concerns and always siding with the younger sibling. However, the author also escalates conflicts by deliberately retaliating with petty acts of revenge, and in this specific instance, interrupted an important system update and then told family members to ""go fuck off.""

While the author's frustration is completely understandable given the constant verbal abuse they're enduring, their method of handling it through retaliation is making the situation worse for everyone. The sister's daily insults are cruel and damaging. The parents are failing in their duty to address the bullying and create a respectful household environment.

This is a case where everyone's behavior is problematic - the sister for the constant insults, the parents for enabling the toxic dynamic and dismissing legitimate concerns, and the author for choosing escalation over more constructive approaches to addressing the problem.

The author is faced with a genuinely inconvenient recycling system that requires going down six floors, through multiple areas, and across a parking lot. They made a reasonable effort to find an alternative by asking the building manager. When told there was no better option, they chose convenience over environmental responsibility.

While the building's recycling system is poorly designed, this doesn't absolve the author of environmental responsibility. Recycling is important for environmental protection, and the inconvenience, while real, doesn't justify completely abandoning it. Many people deal with similar inconveniences to do the right thing environmentally.

The guests' reaction was harsh and their language was inappropriate, but their core point about environmental responsibility has merit. Calling someone ""the problem with this country"" over recycling habits is an overreaction, but they're not wrong that choosing convenience over environmental responsibility is problematic.

This appears to be a case where the author is making a choice that prioritizes personal convenience over environmental responsibility, despite having a viable (if inconvenient) alternative.

The author received a last-minute request (same day, just a few hours before the shift) to cover for a coworker. The author declined because:
- It was very short notice
- They had just woken up and weren't prepared to work
- They had already covered multiple shifts recently and worked 5 days straight
- They have their own things to do on their day off
- They need rest before working tomorrow

The coworker's request was quite last-minute and vague (""something to take care of""), and while offering a ride was considerate, it doesn't obligate the author to accept the shift.

The author was polite in declining and explained their reasoning. They also indicated they'd be happy to help with more advance notice, showing they're generally cooperative. Having boundaries about last-minute requests, especially after recently covering multiple shifts, is reasonable workplace behavior.

The coworker isn't necessarily wrong for asking, but the timing and vague reasoning make this a fairly weak request. Neither party seems to have acted inappropriately - one person asked for help, the other politely declined for valid reasons.

The author has been in a 5-year relationship with someone who is clearly struggling with what sounds like depression or similar mental health issues. The author has tried to be supportive for an extended period but is now at their breaking point due to their partner's hostility, apathy, and refusal to seek professional help.

The author wants to have an honest conversation about their own unhappiness and encourage their partner to get therapy. This is a reasonable and caring approach - they're not threatening or ultimatum-giving, but rather trying to address the situation constructively.

While the partner is clearly struggling with mental health issues (which isn't their fault), their hostility toward support attempts and refusal to seek help when it's clearly needed does create problems in the relationship. However, mental health struggles can make it very difficult to recognize the need for help or take action.

The author is dealing with depression and self-harm, which is serious, but they communicated their boundaries about how they wanted to be treated. The friend discovered this information and responded with what she believed was caring behavior - being extra attentive, speaking in a gentle/childlike voice, and repeatedly offering support.

However, the friend's approach, while well-intentioned, was infantilizing and continued even after the author tried to communicate that they were ""fine."" The friend ignored these initial attempts at boundary-setting.

The author's final response was harsh - essentially giving an ultimatum about cutting off communication - but it came after their gentler attempts to address the issue were ignored. While the delivery could have been more tactful, setting boundaries about unwanted treatment is reasonable and necessary.

The friend meant well but failed to listen to what the author actually needed and instead imposed her own idea of what help should look like. The author could have been more diplomatic in their final communication, but their frustration was understandable given the circumstances.

This seems like a case where both parties made mistakes - the friend by not respecting boundaries despite good intentions, and the author by delivering their final boundary in a harsh, ultimatum-like way rather than having a more constructive conversation.

The author was clearly in emotional distress and seeking support/venting space in their group chat. When their friend offered what they felt was helpful advice about ""not getting invested too quickly,"" the author firmly but politely set a boundary, explaining they weren't looking for lessons but rather emotional support. The author was direct about their needs and explained their reasoning.

The friend, while likely well-intentioned, gave unsolicited advice to someone who was clearly just venting. When the author set a boundary, the friend responded somewhat defensively, saying it ""rubs me the wrong way to have it taken in such a negative way."" This suggests the friend took the boundary-setting personally rather than respecting the author's clearly stated needs.

The author's response was assertive but not aggressive - they explained their position, acknowledged they didn't mean to ""go off,"" and even used friendly emojis. They were communicating their emotional needs clearly. The friend's defensive reaction and somewhat passive-aggressive final message suggests they didn't handle the boundary well.

The author volunteered personal information about Rebecca's political beliefs (having a Republican flag in her room) to justify their role assignments in a class simulation. While the author's intention was to provide context and perhaps add some humor, they shared information about Rebecca without her permission in an environment where she clearly felt vulnerable about her political identity.

Rebecca's reaction - feeling ""humiliated and isolated"" - suggests this disclosure had real negative consequences for her. Even though she may not be secretive about her conservative views in general, there's a difference between someone choosing to share their own political beliefs and having someone else announce them to a class.

The author acknowledges they ""should not volunteer information about other people that they may not be comfortable with becoming public"" and feels awful about the impact. This shows awareness that they crossed a boundary, even if unintentionally.

While Rebecca could potentially communicate her boundaries more clearly beforehand, the primary responsibility lies with the person sharing information about others. The author made an assumption about what Rebecca would be comfortable with rather than asking first.

The author made a significant assumption about exclusivity without having the defining conversation, which was his mistake. However, his emotional reaction to seeing someone he'd been intimately involved with (spending 3-4 nights a week together for 1.5 months) suddenly ignore him and make out with another person at a party is understandable, even if not handled perfectly.

The girlfriend technically didn't break any explicit agreement since they never discussed exclusivity. However, her behavior was quite hurtful - completely shifting attention from someone she'd been physically affectionate with all evening to another person, then making out with that person in full view. While not technically ""wrong"" by the strictest interpretation, it showed poor consideration for someone's feelings.

The author's public outburst was inappropriate and embarrassing for everyone involved. However, the girlfriend and her friends' continued harassment calling him names seems excessive given that he was genuinely hurt by the situation.

Both parties contributed to this mess - the author through assumptions and poor emotional regulation, and the girlfriend through inconsiderate behavior despite technical correctness about their undefined status.

The author is a 17-year-old who has faced years of bullying and antisemitic harassment about her appearance. She's been deeply hurt by cruel comments, including from someone she had feelings for. Her request for a nose job comes from a place of genuine pain and a desire to feel more confident as she enters college. She's not rejecting her Jewish identity - she explicitly states she considers herself Jewish both culturally and religiously. She simply wants to reduce the target she feels she carries for harassment.

Her parents, while well-intentioned in wanting her to embrace her heritage and not give in to bullies, are dismissing the very real psychological impact this has had on their daughter. They're treating her desire for the surgery as a rejection of her Jewish identity rather than recognizing it as a response to trauma from years of bullying and antisemitism. Their cold shoulder treatment is particularly concerning given that she's already struggling with self-esteem issues.

The real fault lies with the bullies and antisemites who have tormented this young woman for years. However, between the author and her parents, the parents are being unsympathetic to their daughter's genuine suffering and are making her feel worse during an already difficult time.

The author has spent years curating a personal playlist from their Discover Weekly, which they're proud of. When their wife copied a large chunk of these songs to her own playlist in the same order, it created confusion about whose playlist they were listening to and seemingly diminished the uniqueness of the author's curation.

However, the author's response seems disproportionate. Music discovery and sharing is typically a positive thing in relationships. The wife didn't steal anything - she appreciated the music her partner had found and wanted to enjoy it too. The author's demand that she delete songs or reorder them comes across as possessive over something that should ideally be shared between partners.

The wife's anger is understandable given that she was essentially told to stop enjoying music her partner had introduced her to. The author's framing of wanting her to ""find her own music"" suggests they view this as some kind of creative theft rather than normal music sharing between couples.

While I can understand the author feeling some frustration about playlist confusion, their reaction and demands were unreasonable for what amounts to a minor inconvenience in a marriage.

While the author could have handled the beer-pouring differently, her actions were driven by fear and desperation in a crisis situation created entirely by her boyfriend's reckless behavior. The boyfriend's drinking problem and refusal to acknowledge the danger he's putting everyone in is the core issue here.

The author initiated the breakup due to their mental health struggles in a new environment, which is understandable. However, after the breakup, they continued to contact their ex despite being told to stop, sent multiple texts over the years, and are now considering reaching out again after being blocked. This pattern shows a lack of respect for their ex's clearly stated boundaries.

The ex's response of telling them to stop contacting her and eventually blocking them is a reasonable way to enforce boundaries after a breakup. While the author perceives this as ""cruel and uncaring,"" the ex has the right to move on and not maintain contact with someone who broke up with them.

The author seems to be minimizing their own boundary-crossing behavior while characterizing their ex as the problem for not wanting to reconcile. The ex is not obligated to ""try and listen"" or maintain any relationship after being broken up with, especially when they've explicitly asked to be left alone.

The author engaged in several problematic behaviors:
- Grabbed the girl's buttocks after she said ""don't do it"" - this is sexual assault when someone explicitly says no
- Requested nude photos from a minor (both are 16)
- Called their consensual kissing ""disgusting"" and said he didn't want to see her ""for a long time"" - this was cruel and hurtful
- Shows little understanding of why his actions were wrong, focusing more on social consequences than the harm caused

The girl's behavior was largely appropriate:
- She clearly communicated her boundaries when she said ""don't do it""
- She declined to send nude photos
- She expressed her feelings honestly
- Telling classmates about the situation could be seen as seeking support after experiencing unwanted sexual contact

The classmates' reaction of supporting the girl and distancing themselves from the author appears to be a reasonable response to learning about his behavior, particularly the boundary violation.

Your friend expressed clear interest in this girl (""I'm definitely going to hook up with her tonight""), but he got kicked out of the bar before anything could happen. You then hooked up with her later that night. While your friend's statement doesn't give him exclusive rights to pursue someone, it does create a reasonable expectation among friends that you wouldn't immediately move in on someone they've expressed romantic interest in, especially on the same night.

The fact that your friend hasn't spoken to you since suggests this violated his trust and hurt him significantly. Even though there was no prior relationship between them and she was free to make her own choices, friend dynamics involve some level of consideration for each other's expressed interests.

However, your friend also bears some responsibility - getting kicked out of the bar was his own doing, and his declaration doesn't actually reserve someone for him. The girl also made her own autonomous choice about who to be with.

This seems like a situation where everyone could have handled things better - you could have been more considerate of your friend's expressed interest, and he could have been more mature about the situation and communicated rather than giving you the silent treatment.

The author is a 17-year-old who receives money from relatives specifically to ""treat herself,"" which she saves for personal purchases. Her mother repeatedly borrows this money without asking and fails to return it promptly despite having money for non-essential items like new clothes, cigarettes, and beer. The mother took money the author was specifically saving for a Kindle months ago and hasn't returned it despite the author's subtle hints.

While the author doesn't ""work"" for this money in a traditional sense, it was given to her by relatives with the explicit purpose of being hers to spend on herself. The mother's pattern of taking money without asking, not returning it promptly, and prioritizing her own wants (new shoes, dress, cigarettes, beer) over honoring her debt to her daughter shows a lack of respect for boundaries and commitments.

The author is being reasonable in expecting borrowed money to be returned, especially when it was earmarked for a specific purchase. The mother's behavior of treating her daughter's savings as an available family fund without proper communication or timely repayment is problematic.

The author handled this maturely by recognizing the situation, communicating clearly, and proposing a reasonable solution that didn't demand the group change for them. The friends who responded negatively showed a lack of empathy and made unfair characterizations of the author's motivations.

The author explicitly stated they understood the group wanted to play competitive games and had ""no right to demand a change just for my sake"" - this shows self-awareness and consideration for others.

The girlfriend was actively tearing apart a scrapbook that the biological mother made for her 5-year-old daughter, throwing away pictures of the child with her biological mother. This happened while the child was present and distressed, pleading for her to stop. The girlfriend's reasoning - that because she's now raising the child, the biological mother ""doesn't deserve to be remembered"" - shows a concerning lack of understanding about what's best for the child.

Even when the author explained he wanted to preserve these memories for his daughter (not himself) and store them appropriately, the girlfriend insisted on destroying ""all evidence"" of the ex-wife. This goes beyond reasonable boundaries and enters territory that could be psychologically harmful to the child.

The author's response - stopping the destruction and preserving the photos for his daughter's sake - demonstrates appropriate parenting priorities. He's putting his child's emotional wellbeing and right to her own history above adult relationship dynamics.

The author is expressing a philosophical view that diseases like cancer serve a beneficial population control function, and that humanity doesn't deserve cures until we can control population growth responsibly. They acknowledge this view would be hurtful to those who have lost loved ones to disease.

While the author has a right to hold and express philosophical views about population dynamics, the specific framing here is problematic. They're essentially arguing that the suffering and death of millions of people from diseases is beneficial and necessary. This shows a concerning lack of empathy and devalues human life. The casual way they discuss others' suffering and death as serving a greater good is callous.

However, this appears to be someone sharing a genuinely held (if misguided) philosophical position rather than intentionally trying to harm others. They seem to be grappling with complex global issues, even if their conclusions are deeply flawed.

The view itself is ethically problematic, but expressing controversial philosophical positions, even insensitive ones, doesn't necessarily make someone ""at fault"" in the same way as harmful actions would.

The author is a high school student who feels left out because their parents are spending significant money ($1200/month) on private school for their grade 3 sister who has apparent dyslexia and is struggling academically. The author acknowledges they don't struggle with grades but still wants to attend private school for the prestige and potential benefits.

The parents' decision appears to be based on genuine need - the sister is falling behind and likely has a learning disability that requires specialized attention. The author admits they've never struggled with grades and have never needed help with schoolwork. The parents are making educational decisions based on each child's individual needs, which is actually good parenting.

While the author's feelings of being ""tossed to the side"" are understandable from an emotional standpoint, their reasoning centers largely on wanting the prestige of saying they attended private school and a belief they would benefit despite already performing well. This seems more about wanting equal treatment in terms of money spent rather than equal treatment based on educational needs.

The author isn't being malicious, but their perspective shows a lack of understanding about why their sister needs different support. They're conflating equal spending with fair treatment.

Few days ago, I was at work...",Other,Other,0.72,0.7142857142857143,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the balance between reasonable communication in a relationship and personal privacy boundaries.

The author is asking basic questions about her boyfriend's whereabouts and who he's with - this is generally considered normal communication between partners living together. When someone you live with asks where you are or who you're with, it's typically not about control but about basic awareness and connection. Her concern escalated when he became evasive and then explicitly refused to share this information.

The boyfriend's response seems unnecessarily secretive and defensive. While everyone deserves some privacy, completely refusing to tell your live-in partner who you're spending time with, especially when directly asked, creates suspicion and breaks down trust. His statement that she has ""no right to know"" where he is or who he's with is quite extreme for a committed relationship where they live together.

However, the author's insistence and the way she describes pushing for answers could potentially be seen as somewhat controlling, though her reaction seems more driven by confusion and concern than possessiveness.

The boyfriend's behavior is the primary issue here - his secretiveness and refusal to provide basic information that most partners would share freely is creating unnecessary conflict and suspicion.

The packa...,Author,Author,0.72,0.875,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider both the cheese consumption and the reaction to her anger.

The cheese eating itself seems like a reasonable misunderstanding - the author didn't know how many pieces were originally there, the package was addressed to both of them, and his fiancée had been talking about eating healthy. He also waited several days before touching it and ate it over multiple days rather than hoarding it.

However, the key issue is his reaction when she got upset. When someone you care about is genuinely hurt or angry about something, laughing at them is dismissive and hurtful, regardless of whether you think their concern is trivial. The cheese clearly had sentimental value to her (sent by her mother from her home state), and his laughter likely made her feel like her feelings didn't matter.

While her anger might seem disproportionate over cheese, people can have emotional attachments to gifts from family, especially when living far from home. His inability to recognize this and his decision to laugh instead of apologize or try to understand shows a lack of empathy.

The author is primarily at fault for his insensitive reaction, though this appears to stem from genuine misunderstanding rather than malicious intent.

The author has a severe case of mono - a legitimate medical condition that causes extreme fatigue. They're sleeping 20 hours a day at worst and falling asleep by 4pm when not actively kept awake. Despite this, they made an effort to go on the date, suggested compromises (hanging out until movie time, making plans for the weekend, asking to hang out the next day), and prioritized safety by not wanting to risk falling asleep while driving.

The girlfriend's reaction seems unreasonable given the circumstances. When presented with a legitimate health concern and safety issue, she gave attitude, refused the compromises offered, and interpreted his medical limitations as lack of interest rather than showing understanding for his condition. Her suggestion to rent a movie and watch at home would still involve the same late timing that caused the original problem, and would disappoint her daughter who was expecting a theater experience.

The author is considering asking out someone his friend is attracted to, knowing his friend lacks the confidence to do so himself. While the author hasn't made any explicit agreement with his friend about not pursuing this person, there's an implicit understanding that when a friend expresses attraction to someone, it creates a social expectation of respect for that interest.

The friend Bill has clearly communicated his attraction to this person over their regular visits to the restaurant. Even though Bill hasn't acted on his feelings due to his personality, the author is aware of Bill's interest and is considering pursuing the same person anyway. This could reasonably be seen as disloyal or inconsiderate to the friendship.

However, the author hasn't actually done anything yet - they're asking for judgment before acting, which shows some awareness that this might be problematic. The situation isn't entirely black and white since no one ""owns"" another person's romantic availability, but friendship loyalty is an important consideration.

The core issue is that the author would be knowingly pursuing someone their friend has feelings for, potentially damaging the friendship, even though they're more confident in their ability to ask her out.

- They have been ""constantly"" giving Steven shit, even when others weren't
- They admit to not even realizing how persistent their behavior was
- They recognize Steven may be on the autism spectrum
- They're now feeling guilty about potentially bullying someone with a disability
- Steven is described as sometimes acting like ""an asshole"" but also as someone who misses social cues

While Steven may sometimes behave inappropriately, the author explicitly states they've been targeting him more persistently than others, even when the group wasn't collectively giving him trouble. The author's own admission that they were ""constantly"" giving him shit and weren't even realizing it suggests this went beyond normal peer conflict into bullying territory.

The fact that Steven may have autism and is a cancer survivor doesn't excuse any genuinely problematic behavior on his part, but it does provide important context for understanding why he might miss social cues or act in ways that irritate others. The author's recognition of this and their current guilt suggests they understand they crossed a line.

The author's easy irritability and admitted targeting of someone who may have a disability, combined with their own recognition that this was wrong, points to them being primarily at fault for escalating normal peer dynamics into persistent bullying behavior.

The author was dealing with severe anxiety that made them physically sick and caused them to miss school.

While breaking up over text is generally considered poor etiquette, the specific context here matters significantly:

- The author was experiencing genuine mental health struggles
- The method matched how most of their communication had occurred
- The recipient was understanding and not hurt by the approach
- The author recognized they needed help and sought it

The author showed self-awareness about their limitations and made a responsible decision to address their mental health before pursuing relationships. The fact that the girlfriend took it well and they remained friends suggests the approach, while not ideal, wasn't harmful in this specific case.

The author describes a clear pattern of sexual harassment over three years, including:
- Unwanted sexual comments and sounds
- Inappropriate physical contact (pressing against them, touching their breast)
- Being tricked into viewing explicit images
- Explicit sexual propositions
- Creating a hostile work environment

The author expresses guilt about two things: 1) not clearly saying ""no"" earlier due to fear of confrontation and retaliation, and 2) the coworker being fired after they reported the behavior.

However, victims of harassment are not responsible for:
- The harasser's choice to engage in inappropriate behavior
- Their own fear-based responses to harassment
- The employer's decision to terminate the harasser
- Not reporting harassment immediately (this is extremely common due to valid fears)

The coworker's behavior was clearly inappropriate and illegal regardless of whether explicit boundaries were verbally stated. The swift termination (within 24 hours) suggests the company found the behavior serious enough to warrant immediate action. The author did nothing wrong by eventually reporting harassment, and the natural consequences that followed are entirely the result of the coworker's own actions.

The author is genuinely concerned about a 2-year-old's wellbeing in what appears to be an unusual custody arrangement (switching homes every single day). While the author acknowledges they ""shouldn't intrude into people's lives"" and admits they're ""not a parent,"" their concern seems to come from a place of caring about the child's stability and development.

- They're questioning whether to bring it up again, not actually doing anything intrusive yet
- Child development experts generally recommend consistency and routine for toddlers
- The author recognizes their limitations (not being a parent) but still feels compelled by concern for the child

The parents have made their decision and explained their reasoning. While daily transitions might indeed be stressful for a toddler, the parents are the ones with legal authority and responsibility.

The author made one mistake (reading private messages) but took responsibility and apologized. The others made the initial mistake of talking trash, then compounded it by continuing public harassment even after apologizing, showing they weren't genuinely sorry.

The author communicated a clear preference about saying goodnight before falling asleep, which is a reasonable request for maintaining connection in a relationship. The girlfriend acknowledged this, said it made her feel bad, and promised to try to change the behavior. However, she has continued the same pattern 80% of the time over several months.

While falling asleep while texting can happen occasionally, the consistency of this pattern (80% of the time) after an explicit conversation and promise to change suggests either a lack of genuine effort or a dismissive attitude toward the author's expressed needs. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable - just a simple ""goodnight"" text before going to sleep.

The author seems to be approaching this thoughtfully, acknowledging it's not necessarily a dealbreaker while trying to understand if their expectations are fair. They're showing self-reflection about whether to be more understanding or view this as a pattern of not following through on commitments.

The girlfriend's repeated failure to follow through on something she explicitly said she would try to change, especially something relatively simple, suggests she may not be taking the author's feelings seriously or making genuine effort to accommodate a reasonable request.

The girlfriend clearly planned to buy the author a computer, brought them shopping specifically for this purpose, and when the in-store option was too expensive, she found a more reasonable alternative online. She's expressing genuine desire to give this gift and has the financial means to do so (having saved up money and already purchased items for herself).

The author's response, while coming from a place of not wanting to be a burden, is actually creating conflict where none needed to exist. By repeatedly refusing and arguing against accepting the gift, they're:

The passenger by the window has a legitimate right to keep their shade open - it's their assigned window seat, and they have a practical need (reading) that requires light. Their argument about it being daytime is also valid from a circadian rhythm perspective. While their reaction was unnecessarily aggressive (""0-100 rant""), their underlying position is reasonable.

The author's request was polite initially, but they're essentially asking someone to give up their window seat privileges for the collective comfort of other passengers. While understandable, this puts them in the position of trying to impose their preferences on someone else's legitimate use of their seat.

The flight attendant correctly stated the policy - passengers generally can't be forced to close their window shades, especially during daytime hours.

2. It's clearly ineffective - he just buys replacements and continues smoking
3. It creates conflict and frustration rather than addressing the underlying issue
4. Taking items from his backpack crosses personal boundaries

While the smoking friend has an unhealthy habit, he's made it clear he doesn't want this ""help"" and finds it disrespectful. The repeated boundary violations, even with good intentions, make this counterproductive.

The author specifically held the lighter for 10 minutes while the friend asked for it back, then threw it away despite the friend's clear objections. This shows awareness that the friend was genuinely upset, yet the author proceeded anyway.

Good intentions don't justify disrespectful methods. There are better ways to support a friend with an addiction, such as having honest conversations, offering alternative activities, or suggesting professional resources.

The author has clearly communicated their discomfort with their friend maintaining a relationship with someone who was abusive to them. They've repeatedly expressed this over 4 years and have now decided they cannot continue the friendship if M continues to associate with T. The author is not demanding M end the friendship - they're making a personal boundary decision about what they can tolerate in their own relationships.

M, on the other hand, has the right to choose her own friends. However, her justifications seem problematic - saying she feels bad for T because ""he doesn't have anything else going on"" despite acknowledging he's unpleasant and was abusive, and blaming the author for not maintaining contact during college while T did. Her choice to prioritize T over the author (inviting him instead when the author visits) sends a clear message about her priorities.

The author is not being controlling by setting a boundary about their own participation in the friendship. They're not trying to force M to do anything - they're making a decision about what they can personally handle. Given that T was abusive and continues to speak poorly of the author, the author's boundary seems reasonable for their mental health and wellbeing.

M has the right to her choices, but those choices have consequences, and the author has the right to protect themselves by stepping away from a friendship that causes them distress.

The author received tickets as a Christmas gift that was intended for her and her boyfriend as a couple's activity. Her discomfort around children is a known factor to her boyfriend, and given that they're in a long-distance relationship, their time together is limited and valuable. The exhibition was clearly meant as a romantic gift for the two of them.

However, the boyfriend wanting to include his little sister isn't inherently wrong - he likely wants to share something he thinks she'd enjoy. But he's essentially changing the nature of what was meant to be a couple's gift without discussing it with his girlfriend first.

The author hasn't acted on anything yet (she's asking ""would I be the asshole""), and her feelings about wanting to preserve the original intent of the gift are understandable. She's not being unreasonable in wanting the experience that was actually gifted to them.

The boyfriend is somewhat at fault for unilaterally deciding to change plans for a gift that wasn't meant to include his sister, especially knowing his girlfriend's discomfort around children and the limited nature of their time together.

We will call them S and K...,Other,Everybody,0.72,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the facts and behaviors of all parties involved.

The core issue is that you were misled about the garage arrangement - you were told S and K paid extra for the spots when they actually didn't. This deception lasted 3 years, during which you paid equal rent but received unequal access to shared amenities. That's genuinely unfair.

However, your current approach is problematic. Withholding the garage door opener as ""collateral"" after they paid for it crosses a line into manipulative behavior. Even if you plan to reimburse them, holding their property hostage to force a discussion is not appropriate conflict resolution.

The roommates aren't blameless either - the initial lie about paying extra was wrong, and their apparent sense of entitlement to both spots despite equal rent payments is unreasonable. But your current tactics (keeping their opener, parking in the garage without agreement) are escalating the conflict unnecessarily.

A reasonable resolution would involve honest communication about fair garage access going forward, immediate return of their property, and possibly involving the landlord if needed. Both sides have valid points, but both are handling this poorly.

While it's completely valid to lose romantic interest and want to end things, the author chose deception over honesty. They could have simply said they realized they weren't compatible or that their feelings had changed, rather than fabricating personal issues and false hope for future contact.

The other person doesn't appear to have done anything wrong - they had genuine feelings and were led to believe there was hope for reconciliation. The author's approach was unnecessarily cruel and dishonest, prioritizing their own convenience over treating someone with basic respect and honesty.

The author made a significant error in judgment by proposing with a ring from a previous engagement without disclosing this to his fiancée beforehand. This is a major breach of trust and transparency in what should be one of the most meaningful moments in their relationship. Even though he had practical and financial reasons, and even romanticized it as ""this is the girl that should have had it all along,"" he should have been upfront about the ring's history from the start. His surprise at his fiancée's reaction and questioning whether this is ""really the worst thing in the world"" shows a lack of understanding about why this would be deeply hurtful.

However, the ex's behavior is also problematic. Reaching out to the current fiancée to inform her about the ring's history appears vindictive and deliberately designed to cause problems in their relationship. There was no constructive purpose to this contact - it seems motivated by a desire to create drama or hurt the author.

The fiancée's reaction, while understandably emotional, is proportionate to the betrayal of trust she experienced. Learning about something this significant through a third party rather than her partner would be devastating.

While the author bears primary responsibility for the deception, the ex's malicious interference makes this a situation where multiple parties contributed to the conflict.

The hitchhiker was sharing what appears to be a traumatic experience - being raped. While this may have been uncomfortable for the driver to hear, sharing trauma is often part of the healing process, and there's no indication she was being inappropriate or threatening toward him.

The author's response was to abandon a vulnerable person at a rest stop based on unfounded fears. His concern about false accusations appears to stem from prejudice rather than any actual threatening behavior from the woman. Abandoning someone who trusted you enough to share their trauma, especially someone who may already be in a vulnerable state, is a significant breach of basic human decency and the implicit social contract of offering someone a ride.

The author's fear, while perhaps understandable on some level, led to an action that was disproportionate and harmful. There were other options available - he could have politely changed the subject, explained he was uncomfortable with the conversation, or simply completed the ride as agreed upon.

The author has admirable motivations - they're passionate about blood donation due to personal family experiences and genuinely want to help save lives. Their cause is worthy and their personal commitment is commendable.

However, the author's approach is problematic. They:
- Called their friends ""negligent and lazy"" for not donating
- Made assumptions about their friends' reasons without understanding their perspectives
- Used guilt and shame as persuasion tactics
- Imposed their own values and priorities on others without considering that people may have valid personal reasons (beyond medical/athletic/religious) for not donating

While the friends could have been more understanding about why this issue is personal to the author, the author initiated the conflict by being judgmental and accusatory. The friends' response about a ""superiority complex"" seems to be a defensive reaction to being criticized and shamed.

The author acknowledges their friends ""don't know that it has impacted my family on a more personal level,"" which suggests they didn't communicate their personal connection effectively before resorting to criticism. A more constructive approach would have been sharing their personal story and explaining why it matters to them, rather than attacking their friends' character.

Ever since I started b...",Author,Author,0.75,0.7875,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the author's behavior and mindset around rejection and relationships.

The author describes a pattern of immediately cutting all contact with women who reject romantic advances, viewing rejection as being ""shit on"" and considering continued friendship as ""torture."" They block women completely after rejection and see this as ""what's best for everyone."" The author also shows concerning attitudes by characterizing rejection as women ""shitting all over you"" and expressing anger at being called out for this behavior.

While everyone has the right to distance themselves after rejection to process emotions, the author's approach goes beyond healthy boundary-setting. They're treating women as having value only if they provide romantic interest, immediately discarding any human connection upon rejection, and showing hostility toward the very concept that women might want friendship. The language used reveals problematic attitudes about women's autonomy in making romantic choices.

The friend who confronted the author may have been harsh in their delivery, but their core point about the author not valuing women as people (only as romantic prospects) appears accurate based on the described behavior pattern.

The author attended his girlfriend's gymnastics meet and was uncomfortable with elements of her routine that he perceived as sexual. However, several key factors stand out:

1. This is an established routine that was developed with professional coaches and choreographers over years
2. Gymnastics routines often incorporate expressive, artistic elements that may include sensual movements as part of the athletic performance
3. The author has only been dating her for one month but feels entitled to dictate changes to her long-established athletic career
4. He compared her athletic performance to stripping, which is dismissive and insulting
5. He claimed it was ""his job"" as her boyfriend to ""look out for her,"" showing a controlling attitude
6. His concerns seem to stem from possessiveness rather than genuine care for her wellbeing

The girlfriend's response was appropriate - she explained the context, defended her athletic choices, and called out his overstepping behavior. The author's disappointment about missing their planned date, while understandable, doesn't justify his attempt to control her athletic expression.

The author is trying to impose his personal discomfort and possessive feelings onto his girlfriend's established athletic career after only one month of dating. This represents a significant overreach of boundaries.

The friend with photoshop skills clearly crossed boundaries by:
- Using the author's photo without permission for embarrassing content
- Continuing to use an image the author explicitly said they hated
- Deliberately sharing the embarrassing template in a group chat with the author's crush, knowing full well how the author felt about it

However, the author's retaliation was also problematic:
- Publicly exposing their friend's crush by name in the group chat
- This was a deliberate attempt to embarrass and hurt their friend
- Even though they deleted it quickly, it was still a vindictive action

The other friends enabling the situation by downloading and sharing the embarrassing photo further also bear some responsibility for escalating the humiliation.

While the author's anger was understandable given the repeated boundary violations and public embarrassment, responding with their own attempt to publicly humiliate their friend wasn't the right approach. Two wrongs don't make a right, even when the retaliation feels justified in the moment.

The friend (25M) appears to be dealing with normal relationship insecurities about his girlfriend posting more attractive photos of herself. While insecurity isn't ideal, it's a common human emotion and he seems to be processing it rather than acting inappropriately.

The girlfriend (21F) is simply posting photos where she looks happy and attractive. There's nothing inherently wrong with this - people post photos when they're feeling good about themselves, and being in a happy relationship often makes people feel more confident and attractive.

The author, however, took their friend's vulnerable moment of insecurity and amplified it by sharing a personal anecdote that directly suggested the girlfriend might be preparing to leave him for someone else. Even the author acknowledges this might have been an ""asshole"" move. This kind of input during someone's moment of vulnerability is likely to increase anxiety and potentially damage the relationship, regardless of whether the concern has merit.

The author's story about their own past experience may have been well-intentioned as a warning, but sharing it in this context was more likely to harm than help. It planted seeds of doubt based on a single data point from a completely different relationship.

The author and her husband appear to have made genuine efforts to maintain a relationship with the godson - sending gifts, money, supporting his education by buying school books, and preparing the iPad as a Christmas gift. Resetting a used device before giving it to a child is standard practice for security and privacy reasons.

However, the brother-in-law's behavior is consistently problematic throughout the narrative. He becomes aggressive over normal device maintenance, leaves threatening voicemails, makes unreasonable demands, and has a pattern of being difficult about gifts and gestures. The fact that even the other godmother has cut contact suggests this is a recurring pattern of unreasonable behavior.

While the husband's decision to end the godparent relationship affects an innocent child, it appears to be a reasonable response to sustained verbal abuse and impossible expectations. The brother-in-law and his wife have created a toxic dynamic where no gesture is good enough and normal actions are met with hostility.

- They have separate emergency funds that aren't being touched

The student was genuinely traumatized by witnessing a horrific shooting video, which understandably affected their ability to focus on homework. This is a legitimate psychological response to trauma. However, the student's approach to handling the situation was problematic.

The email sent to the teacher was disrespectful and accusatory. While the student was upset and traumatized, telling a teacher ""what you did today was very messed up"" and ""I don't know how I was supposed to handle this situation differently. I really don't know man"" crosses professional boundaries. The student could have communicated their situation more respectfully, perhaps requesting a meeting or writing a more formal explanation.

The teacher's response also seems lacking in empathy. While teachers do need to maintain academic standards and communicate with parents about missing assignments, there appears to be little consideration for the student's mental state after witnessing trauma. However, the teacher was following standard procedures by informing parents about missing homework and addressing the disrespectful email.

The parents seem to lack understanding of their child's trauma response, but they're working with limited information and dealing with what appears to be disrespectful behavior toward a teacher.

Everyone could have handled this better - the student with more respectful communication, the teacher with more empathy and trauma awareness, and the parents with more understanding of their child's mental health needs.

The author created an intro for their friend, but after the friend spread false information about them and blocked them from defending themselves, the author explicitly told the friend not to use the intro anymore.

The author has legitimate grounds for a DMCA claim - they created the intro, own the copyright, and explicitly revoked permission for its use. The friend's behavior (spreading lies, blocking the author, using copyrighted content without permission, and including other stolen content) shows a pattern of disrespectful and potentially illegal behavior.

While the author's other friends think filing a DMCA is being a ""dick,"" they may not fully understand the situation or the principle of protecting one's intellectual property rights. The author is not being vindictive but rather enforcing reasonable boundaries after being mistreated.

The author expressed interest in sex, had a nice day out, but their partner was tired when they got home. The partner chose to cuddle and sleep instead. The author then took care of their own needs privately through masturbation, which is a normal and healthy response when partners have mismatched libidos or energy levels.

When asked directly the next morning, the author was honest about what they did. The partner is now giving them the silent treatment and calling masturbation ""disgusting,"" which suggests some problematic attitudes about sexuality and personal autonomy.

The author didn't pressure their partner when told they were tired, didn't make them feel guilty, and handled their own needs privately and respectfully. Being honest when directly asked seems reasonable. The partner's reaction - ignoring them and shaming them for a normal sexual behavior - appears to be the problematic response here.

While couples should communicate about sexual needs and expectations, no one is obligated to have sex when they don't want to, and no one should be shamed for taking care of their own needs in a private, non-harmful way.

Regarding the first incident with the ""arrogant guy"" who mocked the author's friend - the author's response (""Oh sure, why don't you step a little more on people while you're at it"") seems like a reasonable defense of their humiliated friend. This appears justified.

The neighbor's behavior was clearly inappropriate - complaining about free bagels that were generously shared, accusing the author of deliberately giving them ""ugly"" ones, and doing this in front of her children who were visibly uncomfortable. This was ungrateful and rude.

The author's immediate reaction to kick them out was understandable given the shocking nature of the complaint. However, the decision to stop texting the neighbor (knowing this would effectively cut off the children's access to the bagels) seems like an overreaction that primarily punishes innocent kids for their mother's behavior.

The children did nothing wrong and were caught in the middle of an adult conflict. They clearly enjoyed the tradition and the bagels, and now they're suffering the consequences of their mother's poor behavior.

While the neighbor bears the primary responsibility for creating this conflict through her ungrateful and inappropriate complaint, the author's response, though emotionally understandable, creates collateral damage to innocent children.

The author and sister physically restrained a 13-year-old against her explicit refusal to have a blackhead removed. This is a clear violation of bodily autonomy, regardless of the ""joking"" context or family dynamics. The author shows some awareness that this was wrong and wants to apologize.

However, the sister is actively preventing the author from apologizing and dismissing the niece's upset feelings as being a ""drama queen."" She's minimizing the violation and blocking any attempt at repair or accountability.

The niece clearly communicated ""no"" but was overpowered by two adults. While she could have been more assertive, expecting a 13-year-old to successfully resist two adults who are treating her boundaries as a joke is unrealistic.

The author recognizes the wrongness of their actions and wants to make amends, which shows some accountability. The sister, however, is doubling down on the harmful behavior and preventing resolution.

The author describes a friend who:
- Regularly bullies others with cruel comments (calling someone ""albino monkey,"" making fun of poverty, etc.)
- Can dish out harsh treatment but becomes defensive when receiving any criticism
- Refuses to take responsibility for his actions
- Apologizes to friends who don't stand up to him but won't apologize to the author who did

The author tried to address the problematic behavior directly, which is actually the mature approach. When the friend responded defensively and refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing, the author made the decision to end the friendship.

Ending a toxic friendship where someone consistently bullies others and refuses to be accountable is not only reasonable but healthy. The author recognized that while this person had some positive qualities, the negative behaviors were crossing lines and creating an unhealthy dynamic.

The author handled this appropriately by:
1. Addressing the behavior directly rather than just tolerating it
2. Standing up for themselves when dismissed

The author describes a pattern where their girlfriend consistently accused them of looking at or talking to other women without basis, showing persistent distrust despite 5 years together and no evidence of wrongdoing. The author claims they never cheated, treated her well, and both families were involved.

The breaking point came when the author saw what appeared to be a photo of their girlfriend with another man and asked to see it. The girlfriend ""freaked out"" and refused to show the photo, then blamed the author to friends afterward.

While we only have one side of the story, the described pattern suggests the girlfriend had significant trust issues that were unfounded and created a toxic dynamic. Her extreme reaction to a simple request to see a photo, combined with years of baseless accusations, points to problematic behavior on her part. The author's decision to end the relationship after years of dealing with unfounded suspicions seems reasonable.

- Setting an urgent deadline (""by end of the day"")

- They declined to lend money without knowing the purpose

- They discussed it with their spouse, which is appropriate for such a large financial decision

The author knew exactly who this person was - someone her former roommate had been involved with for 6 months. Even though it wasn't an exclusive or serious relationship, the author was aware of the connection and chose to pursue it anyway, knowing it would likely hurt her former roommate. This shows a disregard for someone she had lived with and presumably had some level of friendship with.

The former roommate's reaction of treating the author ""like shit"" is understandable given the betrayal of trust, even if the relationship wasn't exclusive. However, her anger seems proportionate to the situation.

The guy was already seeing multiple people and wasn't committed to anyone, so his behavior, while perhaps not ideal, was consistent with the non-exclusive arrangement he had established.

The author was sitting in a priority seat (designated for people who need them) while being completely disconnected from their surroundings with loud music and daydreaming. Priority seats come with an implicit responsibility to be aware of who might need them. While the author didn't intentionally ignore the woman with the walking stick, their choice to be completely oblivious in a priority seat created the problem.

However, once made aware of the situation, the author immediately apologized and gave up the seat, showing they weren't malicious.

The woman who hit the author's arm was trying to help someone in need, but physical contact (hitting/smacking) wasn't necessary - a tap or gesture would have sufficed.

The woman with the walking stick doesn't appear to have done anything wrong - she simply needed the priority seat.

The comment about ""something is definitely off here"" was particularly harsh and designed to hurt her confidence.

The street performer appears to have been doing nothing wrong - she was performing in a public space, which is generally allowed, and responded graciously even when insulted. She took the money and stopped, showing she was reasonable.

The wife's mortification seems entirely justified given her partner's public rudeness to a stranger.

The author's initial intervention (snapping fingers to redirect) was appropriate.

This was a mutual decision that made sense for both of them.

However, the author then made the mistake of telling a mutual friend about planning to save money by buying gifts after Valentine's Day when prices drop. While this is financially practical, sharing this with someone else was tactless and showed poor judgment about what should remain private between partners.

The author's friend is clearly being excessive with the law school content and making condescending comments about the author's law school aspirations. Telling someone ""don't do it"" and ""are you sure you want to do it? It's so hard"" when you know they have those same goals is dismissive and unsupportive, especially coming from a best friend. The constant social media posts about law school also seem attention-seeking.

They admit to being ""triggered"" by their friend's posts and ""faking excitement"" - but they haven't actually communicated their feelings to their friend. Instead of having an honest conversation about how the comments make them feel or asking for more balanced conversations, they're letting resentment build up internally. The author also makes some unnecessarily competitive comments about university rankings that suggest some underlying jealousy or superiority complex.

The author has been providing tech support for years for very basic tasks that their parents could reasonably learn to do themselves. The parents have explicitly refused to learn (""Why? We have you to do it"") and used guilt tactics when the author tried to establish boundaries. While families should help each other, there's a difference between occasional assistance and being taken advantage of due to willful helplessness.

The parents' response of guilt-tripping (""we provide everything for you"") and refusing to develop basic digital literacy skills that are essential in modern life shows they're taking advantage of their child's knowledge rather than making reasonable requests for help. The author tried to set reasonable boundaries and encourage independence, which is healthy.

However, the author did give in to the guilt-tripping, which enabled the pattern to continue. A more firm boundary-setting approach might have been more effective.

The core issue is the parents' unwillingness to learn basic skills and their manipulation when asked to be more self-sufficient. While the author could have handled it better, the primary fault lies with the parents' behavior.

The author has consistently:
- Communicated their boundaries clearly and repeatedly
- Made accommodations and shown patience for their friend's ADHD
- Tried to work with the friend on solutions
- Given multiple chances over many years
- Only ended the friendship after exhausting other options

The friend ""A"" has consistently:
- Damaged the author's property without taking responsibility or offering compensation
- Been chronically late without communication, despite knowing it affects the author's work and volunteer commitments
- Used ADHD as a blanket excuse for all problematic behaviors, including those that seem more related to consideration than the disorder itself
- Ignored repeated requests for basic courtesy (like communication about schedule changes)
- Refused to respect the author's financial limitations
- Had emotional outbursts that damaged property and refused accountability
- Dismissed the author's concerns and accused them of making her ""walk on eggshells""

While ADHD can certainly cause challenges with time management, memory, and organization, it doesn't excuse a complete lack of consideration for others' financial situations, property, or time. The friend's response of ""they're just things"" to breaking items the author had to replace on minimum wage, and her refusal to help pay for damage she caused, suggests issues beyond ADHD symptoms.

The author showed remarkable patience and tried repeatedly to address these issues constructively. The final incident - leaving the author waiting for two hours on an emotionally difficult day without any communication - was a reasonable breaking point.

The author studied hard for the test and witnessed another student cheating by using their phone - something this student had apparently done before. Academic cheating undermines the fairness of the educational system and devalues the efforts of honest students like the author. The author chose to report this violation by writing a note on their test paper.

While some might argue that ""snitching"" is socially unacceptable, in academic contexts, maintaining integrity is crucial. The cheating student was violating rules that everyone agreed to follow, gaining an unfair advantage over students who studied legitimately. The author had every right to report this violation, and arguably even a responsibility to help maintain academic fairness.

The aunt's behavior was problematic - she was being condescending and dismissive about the author's fitness achievements, claiming their 10-mile run ""doesn't REALLY count"" and lecturing someone training for a half Ironman about aerobic exercise after completing just one hike. This kind of gatekeeping and dismissive attitude toward someone's genuine athletic accomplishments is inappropriate.

However, the author's response was extremely harsh and crossed clear lines. Calling the aunt's friends ""pig friends,"" making cruel comments about being passed by ""grandmas and toddlers,"" and the overall tone of fat-shaming went far beyond what was warranted, even in response to condescending behavior. The author also shows concerning attitudes throughout, describing the aunt in derogatory terms and seeming to harbor long-standing resentment.

The author is going through a difficult time - recently divorced, having a ""real shitty year,"" and explicitly wanting some alone time to process and heal. They've clearly communicated their preference for solitude and self-care activities. Wanting to be alone during a difficult period is completely normal and healthy.

The neighbors, while well-intentioned, are being pushy and not respecting the author's boundaries. They've complained about being ""neglected,"" scolded the author for not immediately visiting upon arrival, and are insisting on the party invitation despite clear reluctance. The author's mother is also being controlling by monitoring through cameras and pressuring about social activities.

The only questionable action by the author was lying about going to a restaurant party instead of being honest about wanting to stay home. However, this appears to be a defensive response to avoid further pressure and judgment, which is understandable given the circumstances.

Adults have the right to decline social invitations without justification, especially when dealing with personal difficulties. The author is not obligated to attend social events to make others feel better, and their desire for solitude is valid and healthy.

The author acknowledges they ""overstepped by showing too much persistence"" by asking someone out three times after being told no. This caused the person to become ""really really mad,"" indicating the author's behavior was inappropriate and made the other person uncomfortable or upset.

Now, after 6 months of no contact, the author wants to call this person ""just to see how she's doing."" However, given the context:

1. The person was very angry at the author's persistent behavior
2. She clearly wanted to be left alone (hence the anger)
3. The author cut contact, which was the appropriate response
4. Reaching out again, even with claimed innocent intentions, would likely be unwelcome and could be seen as continuing the unwanted attention

The person has already clearly communicated through her anger that she doesn't want this type of attention from the author. Respecting someone's boundaries means staying away when they've made it clear they don't want contact, regardless of the author's intentions.

The author seems to be considering this action more for their own emotional needs (""I still feel shitty"") rather than what would actually be best for the other person.

The author made a comment ""jumping back on that dick again, eh"" when their friend Sam (who uses they/them pronouns) told them about dating someone new who has male anatomy. Sam took great offense, interpreting this as transphobic and bigoted language.

While the author claims they meant it literally and were trying to be cheeky, this type of comment reduces people to their genitalia and can be particularly harmful when discussing relationships involving transgender or non-binary individuals. Even if unintentional, the comment was insensitive given the context of discussing Sam's new partner who presents as male but uses they/them pronouns.

The author did acknowledge the comment was ""tone deaf"" and apologized, which shows some recognition of the harm caused. However, they seem to minimize the impact and question whether their friend's reaction was justified.

Sam's strong reaction suggests this comment was genuinely hurtful and felt dehumanizing, especially in the context of their identity and their partner's identity. The fact that it ""ruined their friendship"" indicates the comment crossed a significant line for Sam.

While the author may not have intended harm, the impact of their words was clearly significant, and their continued questioning of whether they were ""THAT much of an asshole"" suggests they haven't fully grasped why their comment was so problematic.

She also broke up with him during his study abroad to hook up with her ex, then got back together. This represents a pattern of dishonesty and emotional infidelity.

Additionally, he encouraged her to move closer to him while having unresolved doubts about the relationship, then broke up with her shortly after she made this significant life change.

While the girlfriend's emotional cheating and dishonesty were serious relationship violations that occurred first and created the underlying trust issues, the author's invasion of privacy was also wrong, even if it revealed important information.

The author did take responsible action by forwarding concerning messages to the partner's father and calling when they suspected imminent danger. They also tried to set appropriate boundaries.

While cheating is never acceptable, the author's subsequent actions show they recognized their wrongdoing and tried to handle the situation responsibly. The partner's refusal to accept the breakup and escalation to self-harm threats represents a more serious pattern of problematic behavior.

During this break, the friend developed feelings for the ex-partner and pursued them (though apparently unsuccessfully). The author feels betrayed, especially since the friend had previously presented as gay.

While I understand the author's hurt feelings, they don't have exclusive claim over someone they're on a break with. The friend, while perhaps not following ideal ""friend code"" etiquette, isn't necessarily doing anything objectively wrong by developing feelings for someone who is currently single. The ex-partner appears to have rejected these advances, so she's handling the situation appropriately.

The author's hostility and assumption that others are ""just as much if not more"" at fault suggests they're struggling to accept that during a relationship break, other people may develop feelings for their ex-partner. This is painful but not necessarily anyone's fault.

The friend's previous sexual orientation presentation is a separate issue and doesn't make pursuing someone inherently wrong - people's understanding of their sexuality can evolve.

He of...",Author,Author,0.75,0.9103448275862069,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider whether anyone is acting unreasonably or causing harm.

The husband appears to be genuinely passionate about music and wants to share that with his daughter. He's not forcing anything - he exposed her to music from birth (which research supports as beneficial), helped her develop perfect pitch, introduced her to various instruments, and let her choose which one she wanted to learn. Crucially, the daughter has expressed that she wants to learn music.

The author's concerns about forcing music on the child seem misplaced given that the daughter has actively chosen this path. The author is essentially overriding their child's expressed interest based on hypothetical future scenarios (""what if she doesn't like it later""). While wanting to protect a child from being pushed too hard is understandable, preventing a 4-year-old from pursuing something she's interested in and has chosen herself seems counterproductive.

The husband's approach appears thoughtful and child-led rather than forceful. Starting music early (when the child is interested) is actually supported by child development research. The author seems to be the one trying to impose their will by preventing the daughter from exploring her stated interest.

The other person was rude by calling the author a ""bitch"" when they were trying to help resolve what appeared to be an email mix-up. However, being rude doesn't justify what happened next.

The author's response was completely disproportionate and problematic. They:
1. Hacked into someone else's account without permission
2. Changed the person's password (locking them out)
3. Deleted their recovery information
4. Modified their profile

These actions constitute unauthorized access to someone else's digital property, which is both unethical and likely illegal. The author had no right to take control of another person's account, regardless of the initial rudeness or confusion about names/emails. There were proper channels to resolve any legitimate email issues (contacting the platform's support, for example).

While the other person was impolite, the author's actions were a serious violation that far exceeded any reasonable response to rudeness.

The author made 4 attempts to call their husband during a 20-minute commute, which shows genuine effort to reach out and presumably ask what he wanted for dinner or if he wanted anything at all. After receiving no response to multiple calls, the author had to make a decision about dinner while already out.

It would be unreasonable to expect someone to either wait indefinitely for a response, make a guess about what their partner might want, or go out again later. The author made a practical decision based on the information available to them at the time.

The husband's lack of response (assuming he was available to answer) created the situation where he was excluded from the dinner plans. Without knowing his preferences or even if he wanted dinner, the author couldn't reasonably be expected to get him something.

The grand aunt has been persistently trying to force the author to return to church despite the author clearly having stopped attending years ago. While her intentions may come from a place of care and religious conviction, repeatedly pressuring someone about their religious choices after they've made their position clear crosses boundaries and shows a lack of respect for the author's autonomy.

The author was tired from camp and reached a breaking point after ongoing pressure. However, shouting at an elderly relative and calling her ""crazy and delusional"" was unnecessarily harsh and hurtful, even if the frustration was understandable. The author also acknowledges feeling bad about it but refuses to apologize, which compounds the issue.

The grand aunt initiated the problematic behavior through persistent religious pressure, but the author escalated it to personal attacks. Both parties handled this poorly - one through boundary violations and the other through verbal cruelty.

The author demonstrates several problematic attitudes and behaviors:

1. **Medical misinformation**: They incorrectly believe that having had the flu once this year makes them immune to spreading it. Flu immunity is strain-specific, and there are multiple strains circulating each season.

2. **Disregard for vulnerable populations**: Even when the nurse explained that masks protect ""seniors and kids who are more vulnerable,"" the author dismissed this concern, showing a lack of empathy for other patients in the hospital.

3. **Inappropriate hospital behavior**: Hospitals have infection control policies for good reason. Refusing to follow basic safety protocols in a healthcare setting puts other patients at risk.

4. **Hostile attitude toward healthcare worker**: The author admits to being rude to the nurse who was simply doing their job to protect patients.

5. **Selfish reasoning**: The statement ""It is not my problem if you cannot take care of yourself"" shows a fundamental lack of understanding about community health responsibility, especially in a hospital setting with immunocompromised patients.

The author's concerns seem legitimate - his girlfriend was pressuring him about clothing choices, wanting to do cocaine with a sketchy stranger who was already distributing drugs without clear consent, and engaging in increasingly reckless behavior that concerned him as her partner. His decision to leave the dangerous situation was reasonable, and his initial upset feelings were understandable.

However, the girlfriend also has some valid points. They were on vacation, she wanted to have fun and dance, and while her judgment may have been impaired by alcohol and her medication interactions, she wasn't necessarily doing anything malicious. The author's reaction of telling her to ""fuck off"" and storming out escalated the conflict unnecessarily.

The core issue seems to be a mismatch in how they wanted to spend their vacation, combined with concerning substance use patterns and communication breakdown under stress. The girlfriend's reckless behavior and drug-seeking with strangers was problematic, but the author's harsh response and inability to communicate his concerns more constructively also contributed to the escalation.

Both parties made mistakes - she with poor judgment and risky behavior, he with harsh communication and storming out rather than working through the issue together.

Initially, the author offered to refer this acquaintance and proposed splitting the referral bonus 50/50. The acquaintance explicitly refused this offer, saying he didn't want any bonus and just wanted to get accepted. The author then offered to help with interview preparation instead, which the acquaintance accepted.

However, months later at the Christmas party, the acquaintance brought up splitting the referral bonus, seemingly changing his mind about the arrangement. The author gave a non-committal response (""let's see"") rather than clearly reaffirming that the original agreement was no bonus split.

The core issue is that there were conflicting understandings about the final arrangement. The acquaintance initially refused the bonus split but later expected it. The author should have been clearer at the Christmas party about sticking to the original agreement where no bonus was to be shared.

While the author has some justification based on the initial refusal, the lack of clear communication when the topic was raised again created ambiguity. The acquaintance also bears responsibility for changing his position and not being consistent with his original stance.

The author's ex-girlfriend has been deliberately deceiving both parties - lying to Jack about still seeing the author, and lying to the author about being back with Jack. This creates a web of deception that's harmful to everyone involved. However, the author is now considering inserting themselves into Jack's relationship by revealing the truth, despite having decided to cut contact with the ex.

While the author's concern for Jack may seem altruistic, there are several problematic aspects: they're making assumptions about what will happen (""I know for a fact that if I leave them alone she will hurt him""), they're positioning themselves as the arbiter of what Jack should know, and they're potentially motivated by residual feelings or a desire for vindication rather than pure concern for Jack's wellbeing.

The cleanest approach would be for the author to simply remove themselves from this toxic dynamic entirely, as they've already decided to do. Getting involved further by telling Jack would likely create more drama and complications, and could be seen as an attempt to sabotage the relationship.

The ex-girlfriend's deceptive behavior is clearly problematic, but the author inserting themselves as the truth-teller when they've already decided to cut contact suggests mixed motives.

He absolutely loves to assert himself...",Other,Other,0.75,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider whether the author's proposed response is reasonable given the circumstances.

The author has:
- Clearly communicated that the backseat driving bothers them
- Asked their brother to stop multiple times
- Been told dismissively that the brother is ""helping"" despite it being unwanted
- Dealt with this pattern for an extended period, including a particularly bad 3-hour incident

The brother:
- Continues unwanted backseat driving despite being asked to stop
- Makes unnecessary, critical comments that are distracting to the driver
- Claims to be ""helping"" when told to stop, dismissing the author's concerns
- Refuses to drive himself during difficult conditions while criticizing the author's driving

The author's proposed solution (threatening to pull over and following through) is:
- A reasonable boundary-setting technique
- Focused on safety (removing distractions while driving)
- A natural consequence for the unwanted behavior
- Not aggressive or harmful

The author has exhausted reasonable communication attempts and is now considering a firm but non-harmful consequence. The brother's behavior is genuinely problematic - backseat driving can be dangerous as it distracts the actual driver, and continuing after being asked to stop shows disrespect for boundaries.

While the author's approach might seem dramatic, they've been pushed to this point by someone who won't respect basic requests to stop distracting behavior while driving.

The author is dealing with a relationship that has lost both physical and emotional intimacy. When he brought up his concerns about feeling like roommates rather than partners, his girlfriend immediately responded by asking permission to enter what she described as an emotionally committed relationship with someone else. The timing here is particularly significant - right after he expressed feeling emotionally disconnected from her.

The author's concerns seem reasonable:
- He's already feeling insecure due to intimacy issues in their relationship
- The timing of this request (immediately after discussing their emotional distance) would understandably feel hurtful
- He researched the term as requested and maintained his boundary after understanding it better
- He explicitly said he's fine with close friendships but uncomfortable with the ""relationship"" labeling

The girlfriend's actions are more problematic:
- The timing of bringing up this request shows poor emotional awareness
- When her partner expressed discomfort about their emotional distance, her immediate response was to seek that emotional connection elsewhere rather than working on their relationship
- While she has every right to close friendships, the specific timing and framing suggests she may be emotionally checking out of the relationship

The author handled this maturely by researching the concept, clearly communicating his boundaries, and distinguishing between close friendship (which he supports) and a labeled ""relationship"" (which crosses his line). His insecurity appears to be a natural response to legitimate relationship issues rather than unfounded jealousy.

The author has a diagnosed medical condition (OCD) that creates specific challenges around food contamination. When their husband accidentally burped on their food, the author couldn't eat it due to their condition - this is not a choice but a symptom they're managing with medication. Importantly, the author didn't get angry, blame their husband, or make a scene. They simply couldn't eat the contaminated food and asked politely for him to cover his mouth in the future.

The husband's response was problematic on multiple levels. Instead of showing understanding for his partner's medical condition, he:
- Demanded they eat food they physically couldn't consume due to their disorder
- Threatened that friends and family would tell him to leave over this
- Dismissed the reasonable request to cover his mouth when burping
- Made the situation about his feelings rather than showing empathy

Taking the friend aside privately and explaining that ""no means no"" was actually quite reasonable and mature - much better than letting resentment build or addressing it publicly.

The sister has clearly communicated what she wants - specific skincare products. Even if the author believes these won't be effective due to the birth control-related acne, the sister is an adult who can make her own choices about what to try for her skin concerns. Gift-giving is typically about showing care by honoring what the recipient actually wants, not what the giver thinks is best for them.

The author's intention to get hair products instead, while potentially well-meaning, disregards her sister's explicit request. This could come across as dismissive of her sister's concerns and autonomy. The fact that they describe their relationship as ""very blunt"" doesn't justify ignoring direct gift requests.

However, this isn't a severe transgression - it stems from a desire not to ""waste money"" rather than malicious intent. The author seems to genuinely care about her sister's wellbeing, just with misguided execution.

The author has been very clear and consistent about their preferences - they've explicitly told friends, family, and especially their girlfriend multiple times that they don't want gifts, prefer to buy things themselves, and have specific aesthetic preferences. They've even provided alternatives (consumables) when people insist on giving something. The author has been particularly direct with their girlfriend about not wanting physical items and has explained their minimalist approach and specific office aesthetic.

The girlfriend, despite years of being told these preferences and seeing the author's consistent style choices, continues to buy items that directly contradict what she's been told - cartoon t-shirts for someone who clearly has a sleek, minimalist aesthetic, and a dying plant when the author specifically mentioned wanting to choose their own bonsai as a finishing touch for their carefully curated office.

While the author could potentially be more direct about their displeasure when receiving unwanted gifts, they're trying to be kind and not hurt feelings. The real issue is that clear, repeated communication is being ignored. The girlfriend appears to be either not listening to or not respecting the author's clearly stated preferences.

The friend is a new mother who is being cautious about protecting her newborn's health. While her approach may seem extreme to some, newborns do have vulnerable immune systems, and whooping cough and flu can be particularly dangerous for infants. Medical professionals often recommend that close contacts of newborns be up-to-date on these vaccinations. Her request, while strict, comes from a place of legitimate concern for her baby's wellbeing.

The author acknowledges understanding why the friend would be concerned and initially agreed to the vaccination requirement. However, they're now having second thoughts and seem to be looking for validation that the friend's request is unreasonable by comparing it to their own less strict approach when they had a baby and noting that others have questioned the friend's requirements.

The author has the right to make their own medical decisions, but they also need to respect their friend's boundaries as a new parent. The friend isn't forcing anyone to get vaccinated - she's simply setting a condition for close contact with her newborn. The author can choose not to get the shots, but then should respect that this means not holding the baby.

The author seems to be creating unnecessary drama by questioning their friend's reasonable (if cautious) parenting decisions rather than simply accepting the boundary or declining to visit.

The author is facing an incredibly difficult choice between honoring their father's wishes and helping their family with a genuine need.

While I understand the mother's desperation and the practical need, I don't think the author is at fault here.

- Creating a conflict that escalated from a previous incident

However, the author also took responsibility by:

- Admitting their mistakes to Bob
- Promising it wouldn't happen again

Bob's response seems disproportionate given that:
- The author has apologized and taken accountability
- Ann herself has forgiven the author
- The author is actively trying to make amends
- They've been best friends for 5 years

While the author was clearly wrong initially, they've made genuine efforts to repair the damage. Bob's unwillingness to engage or work toward reconciliation after a sincere apology and accountability seems unreasonable, especially when his own partner has moved past the issue.

The author was the primary instigator but has taken appropriate steps to make amends. Bob's refusal to communicate or work toward resolution makes him partially at fault for the ongoing situation.

This seems inconsistent and potentially hurtful, especially given that the couple has been together for a significant time and the boyfriend made effort to attend this destination wedding.

However, the author's response - leaving her designated maid of honor seat next to the bride during the reception - violated wedding etiquette. As maid of honor, she had specific ceremonial duties and her assigned seat was part of the wedding's formal structure. Moving seats during the reception, particularly when photos were being taken, was disruptive to the planned event.

4. The response is disproportionate - escalating from a harmless (if annoying) prank to potentially criminal behavior

Even if some people are intentionally startling the author, responding by entering their vehicles crosses a significant line. The author would be escalating from a minor annoyance to behavior that could reasonably make someone fear for their safety or property.

The fact that the author acknowledges this ""may backfire if someone made a genuine innocent mistake"" shows they recognize the plan could harm innocent people, yet they're still considering it.

Today, som...",Author,Author,0.75,0.9523809523809523,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider gym etiquette and the perspectives of both parties.

The author has been following what they believed was a helpful courtesy for 10 years - leaving 45-pound plates on each side (135 lbs total) because most people bench at least that much. Their intention was to save others time from having to reload the plates.

However, the other gym member was clearly upset about this practice. Standard gym etiquette at most facilities is to completely strip the bar after use, regardless of what weight you think the next person might use. This ensures the equipment is reset to its neutral state for anyone to use.

The author's practice, while well-intentioned, makes assumptions about what others can or want to lift. Some people might be warming up with just the bar, doing different exercises, or simply prefer to load their own weights. The fact that this person got ""pissed"" suggests this isn't just a minor preference but a violation of expected gym norms.

The author also mentions there were other benches available, but this doesn't change the principle - each piece of equipment should be properly reset after use.

While the author's intentions were good and they've done this for years without complaint, gym etiquette generally dictates that you should completely clear the equipment for the next user.

The author (F18) is prioritizing her education and future by attending important university preparation courses that her parents are paying for. She's being responsible about her academic goals and financial obligations to her family. Her position is reasonable - these courses are crucial for her to score well on a very difficult exam that will determine whether she gets free tuition.

The boyfriend (M20), while understandably wanting more time together, is asking her to skip these important courses just for privacy and more time together. More concerning is his emotional manipulation - saying she doesn't love him and that his sacrifices were ""pointless"" because she won't make the same sacrifices for him. This is unfair pressure, especially when what he's asking her to sacrifice is her educational future and her parents' financial investment.

The boyfriend is being unreasonable and manipulative by:
1. Asking her to compromise her education for relationship time
2. Using guilt and emotional manipulation when she sets reasonable boundaries
3. Framing her responsible choice as a lack of love or commitment

The author was genuinely engaged with new VR equipment and had noise-canceling headphones on, making it impossible to hear the doorbell or phone. The girlfriend forgot her keys and was locked out for 20 minutes, which would understandably be frustrating. However, her accusation that this was done ""on purpose"" and calling him names seems excessive given that:

1. She knows he can't hear anything when gaming with headphones
2. His phone being on silent is a work habit, not malicious
3. He had just received long-awaited equipment and was naturally excited to use it
4. There's no indication this is a pattern of deliberately ignoring her

While the author could potentially be more mindful about accessibility when his partner is out, this appears to be an honest mistake rather than intentional inconsideration. The girlfriend's angry reaction and name-calling, while born from frustration, seems disproportionate to an accidental situation.

The husband is primarily at fault here. While the author violated privacy by accessing his emails, this was done to confirm suspicions about serious betrayals of trust that were already occurring. The husband:

1. Systematically shared private marital details with business partners without consent, damaging the author's professional relationships
2. Used emotionally abusive language (""You'll never be able to do this without me"")
3. Had explosive reactions to minor mistakes, creating a climate of fear
4. Lied directly when confronted about sharing personal information
5. Isolated the author socially by only sharing his perspective of conflicts

The author acknowledges several key points:
- Missing check-in was their fault
- They understand service jobs are difficult
- They were initially patient during the weather delays
- They became ""bolder"" with complaints and engaged in ""incessant bitching""
- They felt guilt and apologized to the flight attendant

The airline staff also showed problematic behavior:
- Gate attendant walked away while the author was explaining their situation
- Flight attendants made jokes about unreliable times in front of stranded passengers
- The flight attendant's apology seemed potentially sarcastic

However, the author's escalation from understanding passenger to vocal complainer, even by their own admission, crossed a line. While frustration after 15 hours of delays is completely understandable, loudly complaining to the point where staff felt compelled to address it specifically suggests the author's behavior became disruptive enough to warrant attention.

The airline staff's unprofessional moments (walking away, joking in front of passengers) were inappropriate, but the author's decision to become increasingly vocal with complaints, knowing it was ""immature,"" makes them primarily responsible for the interpersonal conflict that developed.

The author's immediate guilt and apology to the flight attendant suggests they recognized they had crossed a line in their behavior.

The author is dating someone who clearly has serious body image issues and a history of eating disorders. She's actively in therapy and on medication, showing she is trying to address her mental health concerns. However, the author is expressing frustration that her recovery isn't happening fast enough for his sexual satisfaction.

Several concerning elements stand out:
1. He's pressuring someone with documented eating disorders and body dysmorphia about physical intimacy
2. He dismisses her explanation that his pressure is making things worse
3. He claims she's ""not trying"" despite her being in therapy and on medication
4. He prioritizes his sexual frustration over her mental health recovery process
5. His approach of giving ultimatums (""enough is enough"") shows a lack of understanding about how trauma and body image issues work

Mental health recovery, especially from eating disorders and body dysmorphia, takes time and cannot be rushed. The girlfriend is actively seeking help, which demonstrates she is trying. The author's impatience and pressure tactics are counterproductive and potentially harmful to someone in recovery.

While it's understandable that physical intimacy is important in relationships, the way he's handling this situation - by pressuring someone with serious mental health issues and dismissing her explanations - makes him primarily at fault.

The author was experiencing severe physical distress - uncontrollable shaking, nausea, and feeling like they might pass out. They made a reasonable decision to stop the session for their health and safety. They communicated this clearly and tried to power through initially before asking to stop. This shows they weren't being dramatic or unreasonable.

The main artist showed some concerning behavior by pressuring the author to continue despite their obvious distress, but this seems more misguided than malicious - she was excited about the work and may not have fully grasped the severity of the situation.

However, the other artist's behavior was clearly inappropriate and unprofessional. Making mocking comments like ""put your big girl pants on"" to someone experiencing a medical episode, smirking at their distress, and shaming them for prioritizing their health crosses a clear line. This created a hostile environment and made the author feel worse about an already difficult situation.

The girlfriend put thought and money into a meaningful gift that represented her commitment to the relationship. While the author has valid personal preferences about jewelry and promise rings, the way he handled this was problematic. He initially deceived her by wearing it temporarily just to make her happy, then gave a dismissive response when asked about it, and finally called her gift ""stupid"" and ""childish"" - which was unnecessarily hurtful language that attacked something meaningful to her.

However, the girlfriend also contributed to the conflict by immediately jumping to accusations about his commitment and making assumptions about his feelings rather than trying to understand his perspective first.

The author has legitimate concerns about the stepfather potentially sabotaging the proposal by telling the mother, who ""despises"" them. The author already has the biological father's blessing and support from other family members. The girlfriend was even kicked out by her mother previously, suggesting a strained relationship there.

However, the girlfriend specifically told the author that they would need to ask both her dad AND her stepfather for blessing. By choosing not to follow her explicitly stated wishes about something as significant as a marriage proposal, the author is disregarding what their girlfriend has communicated is important to her.

The author is prioritizing their own concerns about the proposal being ruined over respecting their girlfriend's expressed desires about how this important milestone should be handled. While their fears may be understandable, they're making a unilateral decision about something their partner has given clear guidance on.

This creates a situation where the author is not honoring their girlfriend's wishes regarding her own proposal, which seems problematic regardless of the family dynamics involved.

The author is dedicating 4-6 hours daily to gaming during weekdays while living with their girlfriend, essentially treating her presence as if she's not there. While they do dedicate weekends to her, the weekday dynamic creates an imbalance. Living together typically comes with an expectation of increased quality time and interaction compared to when dating separately. The author's rationale of ""think of it as the same thing, except I am in the living room"" misses the point that cohabitation fundamentally changes relationship dynamics and expectations.

However, the girlfriend also bears some responsibility. Moving in together requires clear communication about expectations and boundaries. If she expected significantly more attention during weekdays after moving in together, this should have been discussed beforehand. The author has been transparent about their gaming habits and stress relief needs, and they are making an effort to dedicate entire weekends to the relationship.

Both parties failed to properly communicate and establish mutually agreeable boundaries before taking the significant step of living together. The author is being somewhat inconsiderate of their partner's reasonable expectations in a cohabiting relationship, while the girlfriend may have had unrealistic expectations without proper prior discussion.

The author is clearly coming from a place of caring about their friend, and some of Evan's comments (especially ""I plan on puttin a baby in her soon. I haven't decided exactly when would be right"") are genuinely concerning from an outside perspective. The pattern of weaponized incompetence the author describes is also a legitimate relationship issue.

However, the key problem here is how the author handled their concerns. When their friend explained she was planning around Evan's football schedule, the author responded with ""Yikes"" - a judgmental comment that immediately put their friend on the defensive. This wasn't a moment where the friend was asking for advice or expressing unhappiness; she was simply explaining her evening plans.

The friend has made it clear she's happy in her relationship and doesn't see these behaviors as problematic. While the author's concerns may be valid, inserting unsolicited judgment into someone else's relationship - especially when that person hasn't asked for help or expressed dissatisfaction - crosses a boundary.

The author admits they can't decide if they're trying to help someone who needs it or if they're overstepping. The fact that this led to a ""pretty serious argument"" suggests the latter. Good intentions don't excuse poor execution when it comes to respecting a friend's autonomy in their relationships.

The author has been helping their grandmother care for their bedridden grandfather with Alzheimer's and dementia for 3 years - this is significant and commendable. On this particular day, they had to wake up much earlier than usual due to their brother's schedule change, resulting in sleep deprivation. When they arrived at their grandparents' house exhausted and fell asleep, they were unable to help when called upon.

The grandmother's reaction - calling the author a ""son of a bitch"" and ""lazy piece of shit"" - was extremely harsh and hurtful, especially given the author's long history of helping. However, I need to consider that she is likely under enormous stress as the primary caregiver for someone with severe dementia and physical limitations. Caregiver burnout and stress can lead to emotional outbursts, though this doesn't excuse the verbal abuse.

The author's response of saying they didn't want to help and suggesting their uncle could do it instead, while understandable given their exhaustion and hurt feelings, wasn't ideal in a moment when help was genuinely needed.

This appears to be a situation where stress, exhaustion, and difficult circumstances led to a conflict where both parties reacted poorly, but the grandmother's verbal abuse was disproportionate and particularly harmful.

The author is experiencing genuine distress due to their autism-related sensory sensitivities. They're not choosing to be bothered by their friend's speech pattern - this appears to be an involuntary neurological response that's causing them physical discomfort (fidgeting, nausea). They're also showing awareness that this could be hurtful to their friend and are trying to handle it sensitively by not immediately confronting them about it.

The friend appears to have developed a new speech pattern (described as a ""lisp"" with pitch changes). There's no indication this is intentional or meant to be annoying - it could be due to various factors like stress, medical issues, or just a natural change in speech patterns. They haven't done anything wrong by speaking differently.

The author's avoidance behavior, while understandable given their condition, isn't ideal for maintaining the friendship. However, they're genuinely struggling with a disability-related issue and trying to balance their needs with not wanting to hurt their friend.

The author's response ""Get over yourself"" was unnecessarily dismissive and rude, especially when his wife was just expressing her feelings. This escalated the conflict unnecessarily.

The decision to break up ultimately rests with the friend - she's an adult who made her own choice about her relationship.

While the author feels guilty about potentially influencing the situation, giving advice (even when tired or not fully engaged) between friends is normal. The friend was already emotionally invested in this other person and likely would have made similar decisions regardless.

The author works an extremely demanding 3am-11am schedule and was genuinely sleep-deprived after not being able to nap for several days. Taking a sick day for severe sleep deprivation is legitimate, and wanting to use that time to recover is reasonable.

However, the girlfriend was dealing with significant tooth pain from wisdom teeth (which can be excruciating) and was clearly struggling with her morning routine as a result. When someone is in pain and asks their live-in partner for help, especially with simple tasks, that's a normal part of a supportive relationship.

The key issues I see:
- The author's dismissive attitude toward his girlfriend's pain and struggles (""her 'help' was just her having a bad time and wanting me to solve her problems"")
- His unwillingness to provide even minimal assistance to someone he lives with who was clearly suffering
- The girlfriend screaming his name and getting angry when he didn't help, rather than communicating more effectively about her needs

While both could have handled this better, the author's lack of empathy for his girlfriend's pain and his characterization of her legitimate need for help as just ""complaining"" and wanting him to ""solve her problems"" shows a concerning lack of partnership.

- The child's interests (gymnastics) may not align with the toy
- The child is in a different state, making it hard to know if it's actually being used
- Children naturally have varying interests and may not use every gift they receive

Gift-giving inherently comes with the risk that the recipient may not use or appreciate the gift as much as hoped. The author seems to understand this (""maybe it was just never gonna be her thing"") but is still disappointed, which is a natural human reaction.

No one appears to have done anything wrong here - it's just an unfortunate mismatch between gift and recipient's interests.

The girl engaged in emotional cheating - maintaining an intimate emotional relationship with the author while still in a committed relationship with her boyfriend. She led the author on with promises of potentially leaving her boyfriend, said ""I love you,"" and encouraged him to plan an expensive trip to see her, all while being unwilling to actually end her current relationship. This behavior was manipulative and unfair to both men.

The author, while understandably hurt and frustrated, chose to retaliate by calling the boyfriend to expose the emotional affair. While the boyfriend arguably had a right to know about the cheating, the author's primary motivation was admittedly to hurt the girl back (""I was hurt and felt the need to hurt her""). This was a vindictive action that escalated the situation unnecessarily.

The boyfriend appears to be an innocent party who was being deceived.

Both the girl and the author made significant mistakes - she through emotional manipulation and cheating, and he through vindictive retaliation. While her actions were more prolonged and manipulative, his response, though understandable, was also problematic.

The author is dealing with baby clothes that have significant sentimental value - they were originally bought for their brother, then worn by the author, and are intended by the grandmother to be passed down through the family. The sister-in-law has already demonstrated a clear pattern of rejecting these clothes (changing the daughter out of them, refusing to take them home) and has a history of being particular about brands and selling gifts she doesn't want.

The author's concern about offering the clothes with conditions (asking for them back if not wanted long-term) is reasonable given the sentimental value and the SIL's established behavior. The author isn't trying to be spiteful - they're trying to preserve family heirlooms that clearly mean a lot to multiple generations.

The sister-in-law has already had her chance with these clothes and made her preferences clear. While technically the clothes were the brother's first, the grandmother gave them to the author's family where they're appreciated and used. The author wanting to protect them for future generations (their own potential grandchildren) is understandable.

This seems like a situation where the author is trying to navigate family politics while protecting something meaningful, and their approach of either not offering or offering with conditions is reasonable given the circumstances.

Side not...",Other,Other,0.75,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the dynamics of what happened and whether anyone acted unreasonably.

The author was doing two favors for her boyfriend - cooking food he requested and providing oral sex he asked for. During the intimate act, he repeatedly interrupted to ask about setting a timer for the food, despite her saying she had it handled. When she expressed feeling hurt that he seemed more focused on the food than on her or the intimate moment they were sharing, he gave what she describes as a ""backhanded apology"" where he maintained he was right.

The boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of consideration and awareness. Repeatedly interrupting an intimate moment to worry about food timing, especially when his partner indicated she had it under control, demonstrates poor judgment about priorities and timing. His non-apology afterward compounds this by dismissing her valid feelings.

The author's response - stopping the activity, expressing her hurt feelings, and needing space - seems like a reasonable reaction to feeling unappreciated and interrupted during an intimate moment. She even tried to process her emotions away from him to avoid making him feel bad.

This appears to be primarily about the boyfriend's inconsiderate behavior and poor timing, rather than any significant fault on the author's part.

The friend (F) was being hypocritical - complaining about others not following directions while simultaneously insulting everyone and telling them what to do. When the author called this out, F responded with name-calling and denial.

However, the author crossed a major line by bringing up F's ex and their breakup. This was a deeply personal attack that went far beyond the gaming dispute. Mentioning someone's failed relationship in the heat of an argument is cruel and designed to cause maximum emotional harm.

While F was being problematic with the constant criticism and hypocrisy, the author's response was disproportionate and unnecessarily hurtful. The fact that the other two players immediately called the author ""a major asshole"" suggests the personal attack was clearly over the line.

Both parties contributed to the toxic situation, but the author's decision to weaponize personal information about F's relationship makes them primarily at fault for how badly this escalated.

The husband has legitimate concerns based on a clear pattern: his wife has consistently been unhappy in multiple pharmacy positions (retail and hospital), complaining about customers, colleagues, supervisors, and work conditions. He's observing that she seems to dislike working with people in general, yet is considering another customer-facing role. His concern that she might be romanticizing the beauty industry without considering the realities is reasonable.

However, his approach and attitude are problematic. He's already decided he's ""against the idea"" before having an open conversation with her. He's making assumptions about her motivations and seems to have little faith in her ability to make good decisions (calling her ""horrible at making decisions""). Most importantly, he's considering going back on his promise to be supportive, which would be a betrayal of trust.

The constructive approach would be to have an honest, supportive conversation where he shares his observations about the pattern of job dissatisfaction and asks thoughtful questions to help her think through the decision, rather than simply expressing opposition.

His wife isn't at fault for exploring career options or being unhappy in jobs that don't suit her. Career transitions are normal, and she deserves support in finding fulfilling work.

The dog clearly has serious behavioral issues - aggression when tired, resource guarding, attacking other dogs, and attempting to attack the boyfriend. These are legitimate safety concerns that go beyond normal pet challenges. The author has tried to work with the situation for some time and even sought professional help by working with dogs professionally.

However, the key issue is that the boyfriend, as the dog's owner, appears to be avoiding his responsibility to properly address these dangerous behaviors. A dog that attacks other dogs, shows resource aggression, and has attempted to attack humans needs immediate professional intervention, not just patience and hope. The boyfriend's reluctance to take decisive action is putting everyone at risk - the author, himself, other dogs, and potentially future children.

While ultimatums in relationships are generally problematic, this isn't really about choosing between a partner and a pet - it's about addressing a genuine safety hazard. The author has legitimate concerns about their physical safety and mental health, and has already experienced significant stress and a mental health crisis partially related to this situation.

The boyfriend is failing in his duty as a responsible pet owner to either properly train/rehabilitate this dog or make the difficult decision to rehome her to someone better equipped to handle her issues.

We have a Facebo...",Author,Other,0.72,0.5,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the communication patterns, planning timeline, and reasonable expectations for group trip coordination.

Carl showed initial enthusiasm for the trip back in September and was included in the planning group from January. However, he was largely absent from months of planning discussions and coordination. Most critically, when rides were being coordinated ""last week"" and he didn't respond at all, this created a reasonable assumption that he wasn't coming.

While Carl does have legitimate reasons for being less involved (moving and dealing with an injury), these circumstances actually support the author's point that maybe this wasn't the right time for him to commit to a challenging winter camping trip. The timing of his move (starting just last week) suggests this was a known upcoming commitment that should have factored into his trip planning much earlier.

The author's frustration seems reasonable - they're being asked to accommodate someone at the last minute who showed minimal engagement in months of planning. However, the author isn't being outright exclusionary or mean-spirited; they're just frustrated with the poor communication and timing.

Carl's lack of response to the ride coordination post, followed by a last-minute request, does put an unfair burden on the group. While his personal circumstances are understandable, they don't excuse the poor communication that left others uncertain about his participation.

The author's feelings are justified, and Carl's approach to the trip planning was inconsiderate to the group.

The other players were clearly behaving poorly by using offensive language (including a slur) and being generally toxic toward the author over their performance in what is described as a casual, random game mode. This kind of harassment is inappropriate regardless of someone's gameplay performance.

However, the author's response of leaving the match also negatively impacts the game experience for all players, including potentially innocent teammates who weren't participating in the harassment. In team-based games, leaving mid-match typically puts your team at a significant disadvantage.

The author did try to de-escalate initially by pointing out it was just a casual random mode, which was reasonable. But when that didn't work, there were other options like muting the toxic players rather than abandoning the match entirely.

Both sides contributed to making the gaming experience worse - the harassers through their toxic behavior, and the author through abandoning teammates.

The author made several questionable decisions:
1. Agreed to secretly coordinate with the girlfriend without informing John
2. When caught in an awkward moment, took a photo of John and sent it to the girlfriend to ""prove"" John was there
3. This photo directly enabled the girlfriend to catch John in a lie

However, the girlfriend also made poor choices:
1. Took John's number without permission
2. Didn't believe the author's explanation and demanded photo proof
3. Reacted extremely by immediately breaking up without seeking clarification

John's behavior was also problematic:
1. Lied to his girlfriend about his whereabouts for no apparent reason
2. Immediately jumped to accusations of cheating without listening to explanations
3. Made the situation worse by calling his girlfriend with unfounded accusations

While the author was trying to help plan a surprise party (good intentions), their decision to send the photo was the catalyst that exposed John's lie and led to the breakup. The author could have simply told the girlfriend they'd discuss it later without providing ""proof."" However, John's unnecessary lie and the girlfriend's extreme reaction were also significant contributing factors.

This appears to be a situation where multiple people made poor decisions that collectively led to the unfortunate outcome.

While I understand long phone conversations can be irritating, especially during a 6-hour journey, the person is following the rules and being reasonably considerate (not being loud). Asking someone to stop doing something they're allowed to do, simply because it personally bothers you, would put the author in the wrong.

The author has legitimate season tickets for that specific seat, which they paid for. Even though the fifth family member couldn't attend, they still own the rights to that seat for the game. The author initially approached the situation politely by asking the person to move and explaining they had tickets for the entire row.

The other person, while perhaps not malicious in intent, was sitting in a seat they didn't have a ticket for. When politely asked to move and given a reasonable explanation, they became argumentative rather than simply finding an appropriate seat. Their response of ""I don't see the problem"" shows a disregard for the ticket holder's rights. The situation escalated when they refused to move and ultimately ""cussed out"" the author before leaving.

The author handled this appropriately - they were polite initially, explained the situation clearly, and only threatened to call security when the person refused to comply. Having paid for season tickets gives them the right to control who sits in their seats, regardless of whether all seats are occupied.

- Set up the author with someone she knew had ""underlying issues"" without disclosing this information when directly asked
- Was dismissive of the author's emotional needs during a difficult time after an abusive relationship
- Refused to provide support, claiming it felt like blame when the author was simply seeking friendship
- Took the ex's side in disputes and defended him despite knowing his issues

- Chose to withdraw and avoid the friend rather than have a direct conversation about the issues

The author is experiencing hurt feelings about their cousin using their middle name for her baby without asking or even mentioning it. While the author acknowledges it's ""technically not a big deal,"" they're still bothered by it. However, being bothered by something and choosing not to confront the person about it doesn't make someone an asshole.

Key factors:
- The author hasn't acted on these feelings or confronted the cousin
- They recognize it may not be objectively a big deal
- They're simply experiencing an emotional reaction
- The cousin didn't technically do anything wrong by choosing a name, even if it feels inconsiderate

The cousin could have been more thoughtful by mentioning it, but people generally have the right to choose names for their children without needing permission from others who share those names. The author's feelings are valid, but having feelings alone doesn't make someone at fault.

Since the author is just experiencing internal conflict without taking any problematic actions, and the cousin made a naming choice that, while potentially inconsiderate, isn't inherently wrong, this seems like a situation where natural human emotions are at play without anyone being truly at fault.

The man's response of saying the author was ""wrong and mean"" before blocking suggests he may have been genuinely offended by the accusation. While unsolicited friend requests can feel uncomfortable, jumping straight to accusations of creepy behavior based on speculation crosses a line.

The author describes a pattern where:

- Author has tried to initiate/maintain relationships but they weren't reciprocated
- The family only expects connection during major events like weddings
- Author's mother is pressuring them to attend despite this history

While family relationships can be complex and there's value in showing up for important milestones, the author has a legitimate point about the one-sided nature of these relationships. They've experienced decades of minimal contact and effort from the extended family, yet are expected to prioritize a wedding for people who haven't invested in a relationship with them.

The author isn't being vindictive or cruel - they're making a reasonable decision based on established patterns. The extended family and mother seem to expect the author to maintain relationships that others haven't reciprocated, which isn't entirely fair.

The author is going through a difficult time and opened up to his girlfriend about his struggles. Her response was dismissive and focused on her own needs rather than offering support. She essentially gave him an ultimatum - manage everything perfectly or lose the relationship. The author has also reflected on a pattern where he makes sacrifices for her happiness but doesn't receive the same consideration in return.

Breaking up with someone because you realize you're incompatible or because the relationship isn't meeting your emotional needs is not being an asshole - it's being honest and mature. Staying in a relationship where you feel unsupported and have lost feelings would likely be worse for both parties in the long run.

The girlfriend's response to his vulnerability was particularly concerning. When someone you care about opens up about their struggles, responding with ""don't forget about me"" and threatening to leave if they can't ""juggle"" you shows a lack of empathy and emotional maturity.

The author was dealing with someone who:
- Misread or ignored clear signals of disinterest
- Was described as ""pushy"" and ""not reading any signals""
- Continued pursuing her despite her obvious discomfort
- Followed her around and inserted himself into her activities
- Misinterpreted her politeness as romantic interest even after apologizing
- Continued contacting her after the trip despite being ignored
- Made passive-aggressive comments when seeing her months later

- Briefly gave him another chance when he seemed to understand
- Resumed avoidance when he misread her politeness

The author is understandably hurt about being excluded from knowing about their best friend's severe abuse, especially when others in their social circle were informed. However, the key issue here is that the author's reaction - freezing up, promising violence, getting so angry they had to leave, and making everyone ""really scared"" - validates exactly why people were hesitant to tell them in the first place.

When someone is dealing with abuse, the priority should be supporting the victim in whatever way feels safest for them. The author's explosive reaction, while emotionally understandable, likely made the situation about their own anger rather than supporting their friend. The fact that they're now pretending not to remember suggests they recognize their reaction was problematic.

The friends and the abuse victim herself had legitimate reasons to be cautious about sharing this information with someone who might react with threats of violence and uncontrolled anger, even if well-intentioned.

The brother's position:

The author has legitimate concerns about having a third person (the brother) live with them during their first time moving in together as a couple. This is a significant relationship milestone that typically involves adjusting to shared living space, establishing routines as a couple, and navigating the intimacy of cohabitation. Having a roommate during this period could indeed complicate things.

However, the fiancé made these plans with her family without properly consulting the author first. While the financial benefit (brother paying 1/3 rent) is appealing, major living arrangements should be mutual decisions between partners. The family treating this as an obligation rather than a request that requires both partners' agreement is problematic.

The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting their first cohabitation experience to be just the two of them. The fiancé and her family should have discussed this thoroughly with the author before making commitments.

That said, the author could potentially be more flexible in finding a compromise, and the situation involves family helping family, which has merit.

The primary issue here is the lack of proper communication and mutual decision-making from the fiancé's side, combined with family pressure that disregards the author's legitimate concerns.

The next day she proce...",Other,Other,0.75,0.9739130434782609,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to evaluate whether there was a reasonable expectation that the offer would remain open indefinitely.

The author made a generous offer to cover their friend's shift on Saturday night for Sunday. The friend declined, stating she needed the money. This was a clear rejection of the offer. The author then made other plans for Sunday, which is completely reasonable after their offer was declined.

When the friend changed her mind the next day and asked for coverage, the author was no longer available due to the plans they had made. The friend's extreme reaction - ending the friendship and calling the author ""untrustworthy"" - seems disproportionate and unfair.

The author acted reasonably throughout: they made a kind offer, accepted the decline gracefully, made other plans, and politely explained they were no longer available when asked later. There's no indication they promised the offer would remain open indefinitely or that they were obligated to keep their schedule clear just in case their friend changed her mind.

The friend's expectation that the declined offer should remain available and her harsh reaction to being told ""no"" appears unreasonable.

I didn’t mind...",Other,Everybody,0.72,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the communication breakdown and expectations on both sides.

The author has been helping his girlfriend's mother with physical tasks regularly, which has become increasingly frequent and annoying to him. When his girlfriend brought up the tree limb job while he was drinking, there seems to be a genuine miscommunication about whether he agreed to do it. The author claims he didn't agree, while the girlfriend insists he did during their conversation.

The girlfriend made a significant error by telling her mother that the author would do the job before confirming his actual commitment when he was sober. This created an awkward situation and put pressure on the author. However, the author also bears some responsibility - he's been doing these tasks regularly without apparently setting clear boundaries about his availability and willingness to help.

The girlfriend's mother's anger, while understandable given she was told help was coming, seems to be misdirected since she wasn't part of the original miscommunication.

This appears to be primarily a communication issue between the couple, with both parties contributing to the problem - the girlfriend by making commitments on the author's behalf and the author by not establishing clear boundaries earlier in their relationship pattern.

The author shared positive observations about their child's school having students with disabilities and praised the inclusive environment. Their intent was clearly to appreciate the school's approach and the learning opportunity it provides their daughter about diversity and equality.

The friend's response suggests a ""colorblind"" approach - that truly respecting disabled people means not acknowledging disability at all. However, this perspective is problematic because:

1. Acknowledging and celebrating inclusion is generally considered positive advocacy
2. Visibility and representation matter for marginalized communities
3. The author was praising good inclusive practices, not treating disability as inherently noteworthy
4. The friend's reaction seems to misinterpret appreciation for inclusion as somehow discriminatory

The author was thoughtful about language barriers and potential terminology issues, showing awareness and good faith. Their core message - that inclusive education benefits all children by teaching acceptance of differences - aligns with mainstream disability advocacy.

The friend appears to have misunderstood the author's intent and applied an overly rigid interpretation that would essentially silence positive discussion about inclusion efforts.

The mother-in-law's behavior is clearly problematic:
- Sleeping in until 11am while expecting others to watch her 8-year-old child without asking
- Leaving the house without notice, again assuming childcare would be provided
- Being deliberately rude (not offering food to others at the same table)
- Refusing to take responsibility when confronted respectfully
- Dismissing legitimate concerns as the host being ""too sensitive""
- Allowing her child to be unsupervised, resulting in property damage

The author (host) appears to have:
- Been accommodating and helpful initially
- Addressed the issues respectfully and directly
- Set reasonable boundaries about childcare expectations
- Tried to resolve conflicts constructively

The wife seems caught in the middle but hasn't effectively addressed her mother's behavior, though she did support the author by waking her mother when the child broke the headphones.

The children are behaving as children do, and while there are some behavioral issues, they're not the core problem here.

The mother-in-law is a guest who has repeatedly violated basic courtesy and taken advantage of her hosts' hospitality. The author's decision to ask her to stay elsewhere seems like a reasonable response to someone who refuses to respect house rules or take responsibility for her child.

At the start of this year we...",Other,Author,0.75,0.8,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the dynamics between someone dealing with anxiety and their partner's response to it.

The girlfriend has clear anxiety issues around being in public spaces with men, which is a legitimate mental health concern that affects her ability to use the gym. She's not choosing to feel this way - anxiety disorders create genuine distress that can't simply be reasoned away. She has communicated her feelings clearly and the boyfriend acknowledges understanding her condition.

The boyfriend's feelings of annoyance and disappointment, while understandable on a human level, become problematic when expressed to someone struggling with anxiety. His reactions (saying ""really?"" multiple times when she couldn't enter, feeling annoyed despite knowing ""nobody is looking at her"") show a lack of empathy for her mental health struggles. His frustration seems to stem from prioritizing gym progress over his girlfriend's wellbeing.

The girlfriend appears to be making genuine efforts - she keeps trying to go to the gym, signed up for a new one, and has communicated her needs clearly. The boyfriend, while accommodating in some ways, is internally resentful and occasionally expresses this frustration in ways that likely make her anxiety worse.

This isn't a situation where the girlfriend is being unreasonable or manipulative - she's dealing with a mental health condition that requires patience and support, not annoyance.

The author made several problematic assumptions and actions:
1. He assumed that because a waitress was friendly and conversational (which is literally part of her job), she was romantically interested
2. He gave larger tips with the expectation of romantic reciprocation, essentially treating tips as transactional rather than for service quality
3. When rejected, he demanded his tip money back, which is completely inappropriate - tips are payment for service already rendered
4. He made a cruel comment about her not being ""dumb anymore,"" suggesting he thought less of her intelligence and was attracted to what he perceived as vulnerability
5. He blamed her for ""taking advantage"" when she was simply doing her job professionally

The waitress did nothing wrong. She was friendly in a professional capacity, politely declined his advance, and reasonably refused his inappropriate demand for tip money back. She had no obligation to proactively mention her relationship status to every customer.

The author has several legitimate concerns:
- They've had a serious disagreement with Mark over what they perceive as animal abuse
- They explicitly stated they don't want to go to Mark and Sarah's home anymore
- They're strongly child-free and atheist, making a Catholic baptism particularly uncomfortable
- They feel they've already given substantial financial gifts ($1,000+) to this couple
- The relationship has naturally drifted apart over the years

The author is offering a reasonable compromise - their husband can attend alone with a polite excuse. They're not preventing their husband from going or creating drama; they're simply choosing not to attend an event that would make them deeply uncomfortable.

The husband's concern about ""looking bad"" seems vague and he couldn't articulate to whom it would look bad. The author makes a valid point about not doing things purely out of obligation, especially when the relationship has deteriorated and the event conflicts with their core values.

While some might argue the author should attend to support their husband, they're being honest about their limitations and offering an alternative that allows the husband to maintain the relationship if he chooses.

The author admits to taking a screenshot of their friend calling someone else a ""bitch"" and sending that screenshot to the person who was called a bitch. This is a significant breach of trust and privacy. When someone vents to a friend about another person, there's an implicit expectation that this conversation remains private. By forwarding this screenshot, the author:

1. Violated their friend's trust
2. Escalated a conflict between their friend and the other person
3. Put their socially anxious friend in a very vulnerable position
4. Created drama that didn't need to exist

The friend's reaction - being hurt, angry, and no longer wanting the friendship - is a natural consequence of this betrayal. While the friend may be acting ""rude,"" this appears to be a defensive response to being betrayed by someone they trusted.

The author had a legitimate concern - they called ahead with a specific pickup time and their food wasn't ready when promised. The restaurant's policy of prioritizing walk-in customers over pre-orders does seem counterintuitive to the purpose of calling ahead.

However, the author's response was problematic in several ways:
1. They engaged in a 10-minute argument with an employee who was just following company policy and had no authority to change it
2. They continued pressing the issue even after the employee explained the restaurant's reasoning (avoiding soggy food) and policy
3. The discussion went on long enough that other customers felt compelled to intervene
4. They were essentially demanding that a front-line employee justify or change established business practices

While the author's frustration was understandable, the appropriate response would have been to either accept the explanation, ask to speak with a manager, or simply take their business elsewhere. Arguing with an employee for 10 minutes about company policy they cannot control is unreasonable and disruptive to other customers.

About four y...",Other,Everybody,0.72,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the dynamics and expectations on both sides.

The author has genuinely tried to help his mother by providing housing, paying for legal representation, buying her a car, and spending $10,000 to improve her situation. He's asking for only 10% of bills ($100), which seems reasonable given that she's working and living there with her child.

However, there appear to be communication issues here. The mother's responses suggest there may have been unclear expectations from the beginning - she references him saying he ""could afford this place on your own,"" which implies there may have been mixed messages about financial expectations when the arrangement was made.

The mother is working part-time and has been through significant stress caring for elderly parents with serious health issues. She's also dealing with legal issues regarding her younger child's father. While $100 seems like a small amount, her financial situation may be more constrained than it appears.

The author admits to his own past failures (2011-2014 period of not helping) and seems to be trying to make up for that now, but may be approaching this in a way that feels controlling or demanding to his mother.

The author made a reasonable assumption that they would be informed if a refill carried an additional charge, especially since many establishments do offer free refills on certain beverages. It's a common practice for servers to mention when something will incur an extra cost, particularly when a customer might reasonably expect it to be complimentary.

The waiter/restaurant failed to communicate clearly about the additional charge when the refill was requested. Good customer service typically involves transparency about costs, especially when they might be unexpected.

However, the author could have asked about the cost before ordering the refill if they were uncertain. Some responsibility lies with the customer to inquire about charges.

The author is away for a college sport and wants to videochat with their girlfriend instead of her going out to party with friends. While the author states they understand her not wanting to be alone and won't tell her what to do, they're still questioning whether they're wrong for wanting her to prioritize videochatting over socializing.

The key issues here:
- Both are college sophomores with their own social lives and commitments
- The girlfriend has made her preference clear - she wants to socialize with friends
- The author acknowledges there will be other opportunities to party but still wants her to choose videochatting
- The author seems to view videochatting as equivalent to not being alone, but that's not the same as in-person social interaction

The girlfriend isn't doing anything wrong by choosing to maintain her social life and friendships while her partner is away. College social experiences are important, and she shouldn't be expected to sacrifice them for videocalls, especially when this appears to be a temporary situation due to the author's sports commitment.

The author made a reasonable request to sleep over at a friend's place and, when denied, calmly asked for an explanation. This is a mature approach - wanting to understand the reasoning behind parental decisions is normal and healthy, especially for someone who lives independently during the week and is trusted with other adult responsibilities.

The parents' initial response was problematic. The mother's immediate ""absolutely no"" without explanation, followed by the father's scolding for simply asking ""why,"" was unnecessarily harsh. The father's statement that he ""doesn't care what [the author] thinks"" was particularly dismissive and escalated the situation unnecessarily.

However, the author did lose their cool and engage in an argument, which wasn't ideal. The fact that they were able to have a productive conversation later with their mother shows maturity and the ability to handle conflict resolution appropriately.

While the mother's explanation about the father being tired from a night shift provides context, it doesn't excuse the dismissive and hostile response to a reasonable question. The author's frustration was understandable given the circumstances.

The situation was ultimately resolved when the mother provided the reasoning (which the author accepted as valid), demonstrating that a simple explanation from the start would have prevented the entire conflict.

The bride is asking her bridesmaids to ""actively lose weight"" and ""look fit"" for photos, which goes beyond typical bridesmaid expectations like wearing a certain dress or hairstyle. This crosses into controlling territory regarding other people's bodies and lifestyle choices. While brides often have preferences for their wedding, dictating weight loss to friends is problematic.

The bridesmaid's refusal to exercise or change her lifestyle is her personal choice. Being in someone's wedding party shouldn't come with mandatory body modification requirements. The bride's willingness to remove a 10-year friend over this issue suggests misplaced priorities.

However, I do recognize that weddings are important personal events and people have visions for how they want things to look. But the specific demand here - weight loss - is particularly problematic as it involves health, body autonomy, and can be harmful or impossible for some people.

The author acknowledges that Southwest has open seating with no assigned seats - this is a clear policy that passengers agree to when they book. Seat saving, while sometimes tolerated informally, isn't actually permitted under these rules. The author was essentially trying to circumvent the boarding system by holding seats for people with later boarding positions.

However, the young woman's approach was unnecessarily confrontational. When told the seats were being saved, a more courteous response might have been to ask when the family members would arrive or to politely explain that seat saving isn't allowed. Her blunt ""So?"" response and insistence on taking the seat despite abundant other options shows a lack of basic courtesy.

The author's characterization of the woman's motivations (suggesting she saw this as some kind of victory against ""the patriarchy"" or ""toxic masculinity"") seems presumptuous and potentially reflects his own biases rather than her actual thoughts.

That said, the author was technically violating airline policy, even if his intentions were reasonable and the plane was mostly empty. The woman was within her rights to take any available seat, even if her manner was rude.

The friend is clearly exhibiting problematic behavior - making loud, embarrassing comments about the author's eating habits, questioning when she says she's full, and creating an uncomfortable dining environment. This behavior is inappropriate regardless of the underlying reasons.

However, the friend's history with bulimia and ongoing struggles with binge eating provide important context. Her comments about food portions and her focus on eating behaviors strongly suggest she's still dealing with disordered eating patterns. People with eating disorders often project their own food anxieties onto others and may genuinely not recognize normal eating cues or portions due to their distorted relationship with food.

The author's frustration is completely understandable - being constantly monitored and judged about food intake would be uncomfortable for anyone. Her desire to avoid eating together is a reasonable boundary. However, her temptation to make comments like ""you should be the one to eat more"" to someone with a known eating disorder history would be potentially harmful and insensitive.

1. A young child coughing without covering her mouth on a crowded bus
2. Various Disney park behaviors (people stopping suddenly, scooter usage, etc.)
3. A family asking them to get up during flight when seatbelt sign was on

While some of these behaviors are genuinely inconsiderate (parents not teaching their sick child to cover coughs, ignoring safety rules), the author's reactions seem disproportionate. They acknowledge that their anger ""gets directed unfairly towards my girlfriend"" and prevents them both from having a good time. They also recognize they might be ""the only one getting upset"" and wonder if they ""can't accept reality.""

The author shows some self-awareness about their reactions being excessive, but they're still seeking validation for their anger rather than taking responsibility for managing their emotional responses. Minor inconveniences and imperfect behavior from others (especially children) are normal parts of public life, and the author's inability to cope with these situations without letting them ""ruin their day"" suggests the problem lies primarily with their expectations and emotional regulation.

The author admits to entering their friend's home without permission while under the influence of alcohol and Ambien - this is essentially breaking and entering, which is both illegal and deeply violating. The friend understandably ended the friendship and set clear boundaries about maintaining only professional interactions.

However, the author continues to push against these boundaries by:

- Arguing when told no, claiming they ""don't deserve"" to be treated ""like a monster""

The friend has been remarkably patient - they agreed to act normal professionally, still play chess, and even had extended conversations. But when the author tried to push beyond the established boundaries, the friend rightfully reinforced them.

The author frames this as wanting understanding, but they're actually continuing the pattern of not respecting boundaries that led to the original violation. They're minimizing their actions by comparing their treatment to how the friend treats people who ""literally assaulted them"" - but entering someone's home uninvited while intoxicated is itself a form of violation that would make anyone feel unsafe.

This was a live, intimate acoustic performance in a small venue - a setting where audience attention and respect for the performer is particularly important. Using a phone extensively during such a performance, even if sitting in the back, can be distracting to both the performer and other audience members due to the screen light and the obvious disengagement it signals.

The author's comparison to ""reading a book in a bar"" misses the key difference - this was a ticketed live performance where someone was actively performing for the audience, not ambient background music. The social contract at a concert involves giving the performer your attention and respect.

However, I do give the author credit for immediately putting the phone away when asked, and for being open to feedback about their behavior. The fact that they're questioning whether they were wrong shows some self-awareness.

The other people (partner and friends) were appropriate in their response - they didn't make a scene, just gave gentle feedback about concert etiquette.

551,My  wife  called me today and tells me about this 21 year old coworker of hers who left her abusive boyfriend and is now living out of her car because she recntly moved her with him and has no friends...,Other,Everybody,0.72,0.5,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives of both the husband and wife, as well as the broader context of helping someone in an abusive situation.

The husband has legitimate safety and practical concerns about inviting a stranger into their home, especially given the potential danger from an abusive ex-partner with a criminal history. His worries about the situation escalating or becoming permanent are reasonable. However, his approach seems to lack empathy and he's not offering alternative ways to help.

The wife is showing compassion for a coworker in a dangerous situation, which is admirable. However, she appears to be making a unilateral decision about their shared living space without fully considering her husband's valid safety concerns or working together to find a compromise.

Both parties have valid points but are failing to communicate effectively or find middle-ground solutions. The husband could show more empathy while maintaining boundaries, and the wife could acknowledge the legitimate safety concerns while still advocating for helping her coworker in other ways (like helping her access resources, temporary financial assistance, etc.).

This appears to be a case where both people have understandable positions but are handling the disagreement poorly.

The author's behavior shows several concerning patterns:
- ""Flipped out"" on his girlfriend for having a normal social interaction at college
- Became angry when she asked an innocent, unrelated question about urinals
- Yelled at her repeatedly about a male friend
- Demanded to know about all her social interactions due to his own admitted insecurities
- Escalated conflicts over what appears to be normal college socializing

The girlfriend's actions seem much more reasonable:
- She declined when the male friend asked to sit with her (showing appropriate boundaries)
- She was transparent about who the person was when asked
- Her question about urinals appears to be completely innocent and unrelated to the conflict

While the girlfriend could potentially have been more proactive about mentioning her male friend earlier, this seems like a minor oversight rather than intentional deception. The author's reaction - yelling, demanding control over her social interactions, and letting his insecurities drive aggressive behavior - is disproportionate and problematic.

The core issue appears to be the author's inability to manage his insecurities in a healthy way, leading to controlling and verbally aggressive behavior toward his partner.

The author has a basic biological need (needing to use the bathroom) and is considering whether to gently move their sleeping dog to address this need. This is completely reasonable and necessary for their health and comfort. Moving a sleeping pet for essential human needs is normal pet ownership - dogs are quite adaptable and will simply go back to sleep elsewhere.

There's no malicious intent, no harm being caused to anyone, and no unreasonable behavior. The dog isn't doing anything wrong by sleeping, and the author isn't doing anything wrong by needing to address a biological necessity. This is just a normal, minor inconvenience of pet ownership that requires a practical solution.

The author is being considerate by even questioning whether this might be wrong, but ultimately this is just a mundane situation where someone needs to take care of themselves.

The author (16-year-old) had their foot propped up due to an ache and has hearing difficulties from an accident. They mention trying not to block the walkway too much and that there was 3 feet between their foot and the door. The hearing impairment appears to be a legitimate medical issue that prevented them from hearing the initial request.

The other person (30-year-old adult) escalated immediately to physical violence by stomping on the author's foot and ankle when they didn't respond to a verbal request, then continued yelling and being aggressive toward a minor.

Even if the author's foot positioning was somewhat inconsiderate (though they claim 3 feet of clearance), the adult's response was completely disproportionate. Stomping on someone's foot, especially someone with a stated injury, and then continuing to berate a teenager is unacceptable behavior. The adult had other options like speaking louder, tapping the author's shoulder, or simply walking around if there was indeed 3 feet of space.

The physical assault and continued aggression toward a minor with hearing difficulties makes this clearly the fault of the adult.

Hanging up on someone expressing suicidal thoughts and then ghosting them represents a severe breach of the implicit commitment made when offering help.

While it's true that no one is obligated to be someone's therapist, once you explicitly tell someone to call you if they need help, you create a reasonable expectation of support. The appropriate response would have been to either provide some immediate support and help connect them with professional resources, or at minimum explain the situation and help them find alternative support - not hang up and disappear.

The other person appears to have done nothing wrong - they were struggling with mental health issues and reached out to someone who had specifically offered help.

They want to ask their uncle if they can bring their significant other of 6 months (who they've known for 4 years and are about to move in with) to a family Easter dinner.

This is a normal, polite thing to do - asking the host if you can bring a plus-one to a family gathering, especially when it's a serious relationship. The author is showing good social awareness by asking first rather than just assuming or showing up with someone unannounced. Their concern about potentially putting their uncle in an awkward position actually demonstrates thoughtfulness, not poor judgment.

The author mentions having high-functioning autism and struggling with social norms, but in this case, their instinct is exactly right. There's nothing inappropriate about making this request, and no reasonable person would be offended by being asked. The uncle can simply say yes or no based on space/planning constraints.

The girlfriend's behavior includes several concerning elements:
- Being ungrateful and miserable during a surprise holiday
- Physically assaulting the author during an intimate moment (punching him in the face, causing a black eye and making him bite through his lip)
- Justifying the violence as releasing ""pent up anger""
- Going through his phone without permission

The author's problematic behaviors include:
- Cheating on his girlfriend by having sex with someone else at a club
- Lying about how he got his injuries to cover for his girlfriend's violence
- Not addressing the physical assault that occurred

While the girlfriend's physical violence during intimacy is extremely serious and unacceptable, the author's response of cheating rather than properly addressing the assault or ending the relationship appropriately was also wrong. Both parties engaged in significant wrongdoing - she through physical violence and invasion of privacy, he through infidelity and enabling the abusive behavior by covering it up.

The relationship was clearly dysfunctional with multiple red flags, but both individuals made choices that were harmful and inappropriate.

The author (F18) is feeling uncomfortable about her dating interest's close relationship with his ex-girlfriend and the drama from his ex-FWB. She's considering ending things because of these concerns. This seems like a reasonable response to a situation that makes her uncomfortable - she's not demanding he cut contact or creating drama, just considering removing herself from an uncomfortable dynamic.

The guy (M18) appears to be honest about his situation and isn't necessarily doing anything wrong by maintaining friendships with exes, though the timing and closeness might understandably concern someone he's newly dating.

The ex-FWB being ""really upset"" about the new relationship and causing drama is problematic behavior, but this person isn't the main focus of the moral judgment.

The author is simply recognizing her own boundaries and comfort level, and considering a mature response (stepping away) rather than trying to control the situation or create conflict. Having boundaries about dating someone who maintains very close relationships with exes, especially so soon after a breakup, is reasonable self-protection.

He started dating a guy named “...",Other,Nobody,0.72,0.6666666666666666,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider what reasonable expectations exist for someone in the author's position.

The author is dealing with:
- Serious allegations made on social media by an acquaintance (Alex) against a former close friend (Mark)
- Limited current contact with both parties
- No direct knowledge of the alleged events
- Geographic distance from everyone involved
- Uncertainty about how to verify or respond to the allegations

The author's approach seems measured and reasonable:
- They acknowledge Alex's pain and don't dismiss the allegations
- They recognize they lack sufficient information to make a judgment
- They're not actively supporting or defending Mark
- They're willing to address the situation if future contact occurs
- They're being honest about their uncertainty

Alex's pain is valid, but publicly naming alleged abusers and threatening to ""tag"" people who remain friends with the accused creates a problematic dynamic that puts distant acquaintances in an impossible position. While survivors deserve support, this approach essentially demands immediate action from people without the information needed to make informed decisions.

The author isn't enabling harm - they're not in regular contact with Mark or in a position where their continued friendship would meaningfully support potential ongoing abuse. Taking a wait-and-see approach while remaining open to learning more seems appropriate given their limited involvement in both parties' current lives.

The author is asking about their ex-girlfriend's sexual orientation discovery timeline after they've been broken up for over a year and had stopped talking for months. While it's natural to be curious about things that happened during a long relationship, there are several concerning aspects here:

1. The ex explicitly said this wasn't the author's business and asked them to stop, but the author ""pushed so hard"" anyway
2. They had already stopped talking months ago, suggesting boundaries were established
3. The ex indicated she didn't share this information during the relationship because she felt the author would make her feel bad about it
4. The author admits they both made each other ""feel bad about who we were"" in the early years

The ex's hostility, while not ideal, seems to stem from feeling pressured about something deeply personal after clearly stating boundaries. The author's persistence despite being told to stop crosses a line.

However, the ex could have handled the initial response more diplomatically rather than being immediately hostile.

The core issue is that the author violated their ex's clearly stated boundaries about personal information that, as she correctly pointed out, is no longer their business given they're broken up.

The author did inform Sam beforehand that he would be on-call during his wedding, acknowledging it was unlikely (99% chance nothing would happen) but possible. Sam presumably agreed to this arrangement as part of his professional engagement. When a genuine emergency arose, the author had legitimate business reasons to contact Sam.

However, the author's approach was problematic. Threatening to fire Sam (""I'd let him go if he didn't get on the fucking phone"") during his wedding day, using profanity, and being aggressive rather than finding a more diplomatic solution shows poor judgment and insensitivity to the significance of the occasion.

Sam's anger is completely understandable - being interrupted on his wedding day would upset anyone. However, he did initially refuse to do work he had apparently agreed to be available for, and calling his client ""a huge asshole"" was unprofessional, even under the circumstances.

Both parties handled this poorly. The author was unnecessarily harsh and threatening during an already difficult situation, while Sam was unprofessional in his refusal and response, despite having agreed to be on-call.

The author acknowledges they are much better at the game due to previous experience on 3DS, while their sister hasn't played since Brawl on Wii and didn't enjoy it then. When the sister got frustrated about losing repeatedly and blamed it on the author ""stealing"" items, the author got ""infuriated"" and admits they probably didn't respond as kindly as they could have.

The core issue here is that the author continued to play competitively against someone who was clearly not enjoying the experience and was getting increasingly frustrated. While the sister's accusation about ""stealing"" items wasn't technically accurate, her frustration was understandable given the skill mismatch. The author could have suggested turning off items, playing cooperatively, or switching to a different game mode to make it more enjoyable for both players.

The author's reaction of getting ""infuriated"" at their sister's frustration and admitting they responded unkindly shows a lack of empathy for someone who was clearly having a bad time. Good sportsmanship and sibling consideration would have involved finding ways to make the game fun for both players rather than just continuing to dominate.

The woman in this scenario:
- Initiated contact while married without disclosing her marital status initially
- Continued to pursue and pressure the author despite his expressed reluctance
- Repeatedly justified her actions and minimized the moral concerns
- Used manipulative reasoning (""putting more on the line,"" ""goodbye"" justification)

The author:
- Was initially deceived about her marital status
- Expressed clear reluctance and moral concerns about being a ""home wrecker""
- Repeatedly tried to resist the situation
- Ultimately made the choice to sleep with her while intoxicated

While the author bears some responsibility for the final decision, the pattern shows someone who was consistently pressured and manipulated by someone who was actively pursuing an affair. The married woman held more power in this dynamic - she had full knowledge of her situation, initiated repeatedly, and used emotional manipulation to overcome his stated boundaries.

The author is being honest about their limitations and lack of desire to be around children, especially special needs children. They recognize they're not equipped for this and have made the conscious choice not to have children. While their language is harsh, they're not obligated to provide childcare simply because they're related.

However, the concerning part is how they handle situations when they do interact with their brother - locking him in his room when he has behavioral episodes shows a lack of understanding of appropriate responses to special needs behaviors, though they seem to recognize this isn't ideal.

The parents chose to have a child later in life and are now struggling with the demands of raising a special needs child. While this is challenging, it was their decision and responsibility. However, occasionally asking family for help isn't unreasonable, though they should respect boundaries when someone says no.

The 7-year-old brother has special needs and his behaviors are likely not within his control - he's not at fault for his condition or the family dynamics.

They suspect the sender may have ASD and might not understand social cues about the level of their friendship.

The sender appears to be misreading the relationship and continuing behavior that's unwanted, despite receiving no positive feedback. However, without clear communication, they may genuinely not understand that their messages are unwelcome.

The author is considering direct communication to establish boundaries, which is actually the appropriate next step. They haven't been rude or harsh - they're simply contemplating clear, direct communication about their preferences.

The author received a bonus and chose to tell their fiancée a lower amount than the actual figure, but then shared the real amount with their best friend while the fiancée was present. This created a situation where the fiancée discovered they had been given false information about their partner's finances.

In a committed relationship heading toward marriage, financial transparency is typically expected and important for building trust. By deliberately giving their fiancée incorrect information about the bonus amount, the author undermined that trust. The fact that the fiancée then overheard the real amount being shared with someone else likely felt like a betrayal and made them question why they weren't trusted with accurate information.

While people have the right to privacy about their finances, actively providing false information to a life partner is different from simply choosing not to share details. The author created this uncomfortable situation by being dishonest rather than either being truthful or explaining they preferred to keep the details private.

The author declined the request and set a clear boundary about not wanting to be asked for money in the future. This is also completely reasonable - no one is obligated to lend money, and it's healthy to communicate financial boundaries clearly.

Both parties handled this interaction maturely and respectfully. The author's guilt seems to stem from their own internal feelings rather than any actual wrongdoing. Setting financial boundaries is a normal and healthy part of relationships, and the friend's acceptance shows she understood this.

Tiffany was persistently complaining about the teacher and making insulting comments about the teacher's abilities, despite the teacher's patient attempts to redirect her toward a more appropriate class level.

While the author could have handled this more tactfully, Tiffany's behavior was problematic in several ways:

- She had an entitled attitude, claiming she ""deserved"" to be in AP Art despite not meeting the requirements

The husband's concerns about fertility timing and financial risks are understandable, but his approach is problematic. He's being ""absolutely opposed"" to his wife pursuing a significant career opportunity that could benefit their family long-term. He's essentially trying to dictate major life decisions based on his timeline and priorities, dismissing her professional aspirations as unnecessary since they ""don't need"" her to become an attorney. His reasoning also includes some questionable assumptions (like children needing friends exactly their age) and shows little consideration for his wife's autonomy and career goals.

The wife appears to be making a reasonable request to adjust their timeline to accommodate a valuable professional opportunity. Law school with tuition reimbursement is a significant chance for career advancement. Her desire to postpone having children during this demanding period shows practical planning.

However, this seems to be a fundamental disagreement about priorities and life planning that both parties need to work through together. The husband's absolute opposition rather than collaborative discussion is the main issue here.

The author is a teenager who experienced genuine happiness and connection with their mom's ex-boyfriend. They're being honest about their feelings and memories of what was, for them, a positive relationship. The confusion they express about the situation seems authentic - they acknowledge the boyfriend treated their mom poorly while also recognizing he was kind to them.

However, the mother was in an abusive relationship and is likely traumatized. When her child expresses missing the abuser, this would understandably be deeply painful and triggering. Her reaction, while harsh, comes from a place of hurt and possibly fear that her child doesn't understand or validate what she went through.

The boyfriend appears to have been genuinely abusive to the mother (emotional abuse, verbal abuse, kicking her out after fights), even if he was kind to the children. This is actually a common pattern in abusive relationships.

The author isn't wrong for having these feelings or for being honest about them, but the timing and approach of sharing these feelings with their traumatized mother shows a lack of understanding of the impact.

The man is at fault for choosing to use the women's bathroom when an alternative men's bathroom was available upstairs. While his need to use facilities was legitimate, his choice of which bathroom to use was not appropriate.

The author describes living with someone who leaves half-full plates of food around and creates what they characterize as an ""insane"" level of mess that makes the apartment ""gross."" Leaving food out can indeed attract pests and create unsanitary conditions, which is a legitimate health and safety concern.

The author states they're ""not a neat freak"" and ""don't mind a little mess,"" suggesting they have reasonable standards. They also mention cleaning up after themselves ""like an adult,"" indicating they're doing their part.

However, the author's approach of wanting their partner to ""clean the apt"" and handle all the cleaning because ""a lot of it is really gross"" and they ""don't want to touch it"" seems somewhat one-sided. While the messy partner should absolutely take responsibility for their own mess, completely refusing to participate in any cleaning and demanding the other person handle everything isn't entirely fair either.

The core issue - one person creating unsanitary conditions with food waste - is primarily the fault of the messy partner. But the author's all-or-nothing approach to the solution shows some fault on their part too.

The author facilitated a potentially valuable business connection between two people who could mutually benefit - David needs investors for his real estate venture, and George has capital and interest in real estate investment. The author was transparent about wanting a small finder's fee ($1000) upfront, and David agreed it was ""obvious.""

Finder's fees are standard practice in business and real estate. The author isn't exploiting anyone - both parties benefit from the connection, the fee is modest relative to potential deal size, and he was upfront about it. The wife's concern about friendship ethics is understandable but seems overly rigid given that:

1. This is a business arrangement, not a personal favor
2. The author was transparent from the start
3. David readily agreed
4. The fee is reasonable for facilitating what could be a significant business relationship

The wife's position that friends shouldn't seek compensation for valuable business introductions seems to impose an unnecessarily strict standard that doesn't account for the legitimate value the author provided.

The customer made an honest mistake - they initially wrote $5 on the receipt, then corrected it to $4 when they realized they only had $4 cash on the table. Their clear intent was to give a $4 tip total, not $8. The author acknowledges being ""100% sure"" the customer didn't intend an $8 tip.

While I understand the author's frustration with low tips and the tax situation they describe, knowingly taking money that wasn't intended for them is essentially theft, regardless of the amount or their justification. The fact that they sometimes do this with smaller amounts doesn't make it right in this case either.

The customer wasn't trying to ""take advantage"" of the driver - they were correcting what they thought was their mistake to give an appropriate tip ($4 on a $22 order is reasonable). Taking the extra $4 would be deliberately exploiting someone's honest error.

The ethical thing to do would be to clarify the tip amount with the customer or only take what was clearly intended.

The author has a legitimate concern about strong odors affecting their comfort in their shared bedroom space, especially given that the husband has IBS which can cause particularly severe smells. The request to use a different bathroom that's farther from the bedroom seems reasonable on the surface - it's a practical solution that could help both parties.

However, the way this was handled and the underlying attitudes are problematic. The author's concerns about ""poop particles"" affecting makeup and skincare products seem somewhat paranoid and unrealistic. More importantly, asking someone to essentially be banished from using their own master bathroom for basic bodily functions is quite controlling, even if well-intentioned.

The husband's response of ""I'll poop wherever I please"" does sound immature and dismissive of his partner's concerns. A more constructive response would have been to discuss solutions together - like better ventilation, air fresheners, or timing.

Both parties failed to communicate effectively about this sensitive issue. The author approached it in a way that likely felt controlling and embarrassing to the husband, while the husband responded defensively rather than working toward a compromise.

This seems like a situation where both people contributed to the conflict through poor communication and inflexibility.

The author is facing a genuine dilemma about a core value conflict with their best friend. The friend believes vaccines cause autism (a scientifically debunked claim) and seems to hold anti-vaccination views. The author finds these beliefs deeply uncomfortable and is considering ending the friendship.

Key considerations:
- The author has every right to choose their friendships based on fundamental value differences
- Medical misinformation can have serious public health consequences
- The friend appears to enjoy ""making people mad"" and stated these harmful beliefs as fact
- This isn't about minor differences of opinion but about beliefs that could impact public health
- The author tried to express discomfort first rather than immediately ending the friendship

While ending a long friendship is always difficult, people are not obligated to maintain relationships when there are irreconcilable differences on important issues, especially those involving potential harm to others. The author's discomfort with anti-vaccine misinformation is reasonable and justified.

The friend is promoting scientifically false information that could be harmful, and the author has the right to distance themselves from views they find morally objectionable.

The author is a 51-year-old man who primarily dates women in their 20s and 30s. He claims this is based on genuine physical attraction rather than specifically seeking younger women for their youth. He acknowledges this pattern leads to relationship problems but doesn't see an issue with his approach.

While age-gap relationships between consenting adults aren't inherently wrong, there are some concerning elements here:

1. The author acknowledges a pattern of problems (infidelity, incompatibility, attracting ""gold diggers"") but continues the same approach without self-reflection
2. The dismissive tone toward people who find his behavior ""repulsive"" suggests a lack of consideration for why these concerns exist
3. The framing suggests he may not be fully examining the power dynamics or his own motivations

However, he's not describing any specific harmful actions - just his dating preferences and attraction patterns. The relationships appear to be between consenting adults.

The issues he mentions (infidelity, manipulation) could involve fault from multiple parties depending on the specific circumstances, but based solely on what's presented about his general dating approach, this seems more like a pattern that may be unwise rather than clearly wrong.

The sister provided significant, life-saving support during a vulnerable time - offering housing when the author was pregnant, cramming her own 4 children into one room to make space, helping with medical appointments, and potentially preventing the loss of the baby. This was substantial sacrifice and care.

However, the author's perspective reveals some concerning attitudes. She states ""I didn't ask her to help me, nor did I force her to pack her kids in one room"" - which shows a lack of appreciation for voluntary help that was clearly needed. She also refuses to visit because the house is ""very loud"" due to the children, expecting her sister to come to her instead, despite her sister having 4 kids to manage.

While the sister's specific demand to know the baby's name might seem petty on the surface, it appears to be more about feeling valued and trusted after making significant sacrifices. The author's dismissal of her sister's feelings as ""just being selfish"" when the sister has been anything but selfish is particularly telling.

The author seems to take the help for granted while being unwilling to reciprocate with even small gestures of appreciation or maintaining the relationship. The superstition about sharing the name, while valid as a personal belief, becomes secondary to the larger pattern of behavior showing lack of gratitude and consideration.

The author made a mistake by reorganizing/throwing away items without asking first, which is understandable to be frustrated about. However, she immediately acknowledged the error, apologized, and offered concrete solutions to fix the problem.

The boyfriend's response seems disproportionate and problematic. While his initial frustration was justified, his continued behavior crosses several lines:
- Yelling and demanding she ""fix it"" without helping or guidance
- Making repeated heated phone calls demanding better apologies
- Saying she needs to ""make it up to him""
- Calling her manipulative when she tried to address the issue maturely
- Claiming anyone would react the same way (which seems unlikely for such an escalated response)

The author's mistake was relatively minor - overzealous cleaning while trying to be helpful. The boyfriend's reaction and ongoing behavior appears controlling and emotionally manipulative, especially given that she's temporarily staying there and was doing unpaid household work.

While the author made an initial error, the boyfriend's disproportionate and sustained angry response, combined with his refusal to work toward a solution, makes him primarily at fault for how this conflict escalated and continues.

The author believes their son should read for intrinsic motivation rather than to complete bingo cards, which is a valid educational philosophy supported by research on motivation. The ex wants the author to participate in the bingo system so the responsibility for completing it doesn't fall entirely on them, which is also understandable from a co-parenting perspective.

Both parents want their child to read and are acting in what they believe are his best interests. The author isn't preventing reading or being neglectful - they're just choosing a different approach to encourage it. The ex isn't being unreasonable either - they want consistency between households and shared responsibility for school-related activities.

The other people at the table, however, created a hostile environment by making derogatory comments about a group of people, then asked a pointed question that seemed designed to identify and potentially ostracize someone, and are now treating the author poorly based solely on their honest response about their entertainment preferences.

The author is upset about not being able to bring wine to Thanksgiving because their uncle is a recovering alcoholic. While I understand their perspective that it might seem unfair to accommodate one person out of fourteen guests, addiction recovery is a serious matter where even the presence of alcohol can be genuinely triggering and potentially dangerous for someone in recovery.

The mother is trying to create a safe, supportive environment for a family member who is dealing with a serious health condition (addiction). This is actually a reasonable and compassionate boundary. Recovery from alcoholism often requires avoiding environments where alcohol is present, especially in early recovery or during vulnerable periods.

The author's framing of this as ""unfair"" and taking ""issue"" with supporting their uncle's recovery suggests they're prioritizing their desire to drink wine over their uncle's health and wellbeing.

The boyfriend's position: He's uncomfortable receiving a gift that has a direct connection to his partner's ex, especially during a romantic holiday like Valentine's Day. Even though it's ""just face wash,"" the origin story creates an unwanted association.

While the author's intentions were good and the product recommendation is genuinely practical, there's a lack of sensitivity to how this might feel from their partner's perspective.

However, the timing and approach were problematic. She broke up with him citing lack of chemistry, then two weeks later essentially said ""actually, let's work on why you're bad at sex.""

They're not being vindictive or unfair - they're applying consistent criteria to a very limited guest list. The fact that they're ""saving him a costly trip"" shows consideration rather than malice.

While the grandmother's feelings are understandable, the author has the right to decide who attends their own wedding, especially when dealing with past trauma around wedding planning and maintaining their mental health. The decision appears to be made thoughtfully with valid reasoning rather than out of spite.

The following is the text conversation that happened afte...",Author,Author,0.72,0.6857142857142857,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to evaluate the text conversation and the underlying dynamics.

From what's described, there was an incident between the wife and 7-year-old daughter that the wife won't discuss. The author then engaged in what they themselves acknowledge as potentially ""lecturing"" their wife via text about the situation, despite not knowing what actually happened.

The key issues I see:
- The author admits to potentially lecturing their wife
- They're making judgments about a situation they don't have full information about
- They're questioning their wife's handling of their child without knowing the context
- The wife's reluctance to share details suggests there may be more complexity to the situation

However, the author also shows self-awareness by questioning their own behavior and seeking outside perspective, which suggests some level of accountability.

Without seeing the actual conversation content or knowing what happened between mother and daughter, it's difficult to make a complete assessment. But based on the author's own admission of lecturing their spouse about a situation they don't fully understand, this appears to be primarily their fault.

The author is facing a difficult decision about whether to reach out to their biological father who has had a stroke. The biological father has a clear history of abandonment, mental abuse, ghosting, and cutting off contact over political differences. However, the immediate question isn't about assigning blame for past actions, but rather about the current situation where the author is torn about showing compassion.

The author is genuinely struggling with a moral dilemma - they're being encouraged by their husband and mother to show compassion, but they understandably have reservations given the history of hurt. This internal conflict and seeking advice doesn't make them at fault.

The biological father's past behavior was clearly problematic, but having a stroke and the family reaching out during a medical crisis isn't inherently wrong, even if the timing creates emotional complexity.

The mother and husband are offering well-intentioned advice about compassion, which isn't inappropriate even if it creates pressure for the author.

This appears to be a situation where someone is genuinely wrestling with a difficult moral choice about forgiveness and compassion in the face of past hurt. No one is acting inappropriately in the immediate circumstances being described.

The roommate is clearly violating established dorm rules (quiet hours after 11pm, opposite sex visitors staying overnight) and creating an uncomfortable living environment. Having people over every night and being loud during quiet hours is inconsiderate in any shared living situation. The deliberate loud sexual activity after being asked to turn down the TV seems particularly retaliatory and inappropriate.

However, the author's communication approach could be improved. Sending terse messages like ""turn down the volume"" and ""are you kidding me?"" rather than having a direct conversation may have escalated tensions unnecessarily. The author also admits to avoiding communication due to social anxiety, which may have allowed problems to build up.

That said, the roommate's response dismissing legitimate concerns and suggesting the author should move out instead of following basic dorm rules shows a lack of accountability. The author has the right to reasonable quiet enjoyment of their living space, especially during designated quiet hours.

While the author could have communicated more diplomatically, the core issue is the roommate's consistent rule violations and inconsiderate behavior in a shared living space.

The author's actions appear reasonable on the surface - visiting a partner's workplace after 6 months of dating, especially when it's a retail store that sells items they could actually use, isn't inherently inappropriate. They hadn't been told not to visit, and the workplace environment was described as very laid back.

However, the boyfriend's reaction is quite telling. His immediate shock, calling the visit ""creepy"" and accusing them of ""stalking"" suggests either:
1. He has serious boundary issues and overreacted dramatically to a normal gesture
2. There might be something at his workplace he doesn't want his partner to see/know about
3. He has an unusually strong need for compartmentalization between work and personal life

The language he used (""creepy,"" ""stalking"") for a first-time visit from a 6-month partner is disproportionately harsh. Most people in healthy relationships wouldn't react this extremely to their partner stopping by their workplace, especially a retail environment where customers come and go freely.

While surprise visits can sometimes cross boundaries, this seems like a reasonable gesture that was met with an unreasonably hostile response.

The author matched with someone whose bio they found off-putting, then decided to give unsolicited advice about how she should present herself more positively. While the intention may have been helpful, this crosses social boundaries - giving dating profile advice to a complete stranger you just matched with is presumptuous and unwelcome. The author even acknowledges this wasn't the first time their ""big mouth"" got them in trouble, suggesting a pattern of overstepping.

However, the other person's response was extremely disproportionate and inappropriate. Responding with a lengthy message full of homophobic slurs and personal attacks goes far beyond what could be considered a reasonable reaction to unwanted advice.

The author has legitimate mental health challenges (Asperger's, OCD, depression) that create genuine needs for connection and social interaction. Their desire to spend quality time doing mutually enjoyable activities with their girlfriend is reasonable and healthy in a relationship.

However, the author acknowledges engaging in problematic behaviors:
- Having ""huge emotional episodes"" when they don't get attention
- ""Begging"" their girlfriend to spend time with them
- ""Bartering"" for attention and activities
- Accepting activities they don't enjoy just to get any attention

The girlfriend appears to be taking advantage of the author's desperation for connection by consistently prioritizing only her preferred activities while rarely reciprocating. While she has legitimate responsibilities (school, family, friends), a healthy relationship involves some compromise and consideration for both partners' interests.

Both parties are contributing to an unhealthy dynamic - the author through emotionally manipulative behaviors (even if unintentional), and the girlfriend through apparent selfishness and lack of reciprocity in the relationship.

The author asked to check the time, the boyfriend acted suspiciously by yanking the phone away, and when confronted about his suspicious behavior, he eventually gave permission for her to look at his messages while he was present. The author discovered he was planning to facilitate underage drinking, which violated a clearly established boundary in their relationship that he had agreed to respect.

The boyfriend's reaction - getting angry about ""privacy invasion"" after giving permission, and only when his apologies weren't working - appears to be deflection from his actual wrongdoing (lying about and planning to violate an agreed-upon relationship boundary).

The author had legitimate reasons to be suspicious given his behavior, asked for permission which was granted, and discovered actual deception about something that violated their established relationship agreements. While going through someone's phone is generally problematic, the context here (permission given, suspicious behavior, and discovery of actual boundary violations) makes the boyfriend's actions the primary issue.

The author seems to be questioning herself about something that was ultimately justified given the circumstances and the actual deception that was uncovered.

The author's partner shared a traumatic experience of sexual assault that was followed by community silencing and victim-blaming. This creates an incredibly difficult situation where she has to navigate seeing her assaulter in social settings within her tight-knit community.

The author expressed discomfort about potentially encountering the assaulter and admitted they might not be able to control themselves if something escalated while drunk. While the protective instinct is understandable, this approach puts additional pressure on the partner who is already dealing with the trauma of having to see her assaulter in community settings.

The partner's concern about it being ""mortifying for the community"" reflects the reality of her situation - she's already been silenced once and likely fears further social consequences. However, her decision to effectively disinvite her partner and then go to the same venue where the assaulter might be present seems to prioritize community harmony over her relationship and potentially her own wellbeing.

Both parties are struggling with a difficult situation involving trauma, but neither is handling it in a way that truly addresses the core issues or supports each other effectively.

The boyfriend's behavior shows a clear lack of respect and consideration. During serious relationship conversations, he refused to fully disengage from gaming, only lowering the volume when asked to put the game down entirely. This demonstrates poor prioritization - treating gaming as equally or more important than addressing relationship issues. Constantly interrupting conversations with gaming outbursts and then asking ""what was that last part?"" shows he's not truly present or listening.

However, the author acknowledges their own fault in not communicating their feelings clearly about this ongoing issue. They've been hiding their irritation rather than having an honest conversation about how the gaming habits affect them and their relationship.

While the author bears some responsibility for poor communication, the boyfriend's behavior during the serious relationship argument - refusing to put the game down and defending his ""multitasking"" during a critical conversation - represents a more significant relationship problem. The core issue isn't gaming itself, but the lack of respect for the relationship and partner's needs.

The author is trying to address the problem and is self-reflective about their role, while the boyfriend is defensive and unwilling to prioritize the relationship appropriately.

The girlfriend has been a full-time caregiver for her terminally ill father for years, watched him deteriorate to the point where he couldn't recognize her, and then had to handle his death and funeral arrangements entirely on her own at age 19. This is an extraordinarily difficult and traumatic situation that would be overwhelming for anyone, let alone someone so young.

The author is refusing to attend the funeral - not because of a scheduling conflict, illness, or inability to be there, but because the funeral format makes him ""uncomfortable"" and doesn't align with his religious preferences. He's prioritizing his personal comfort over being present for his girlfriend during what is likely the most difficult day of her life.

While everyone has religious beliefs and comfort zones, there are times when supporting your partner transcends personal preferences. A funeral is typically a one-time event where your presence matters immensely to your grieving loved one. The author could attend to support his girlfriend while internally maintaining his own beliefs - attendance doesn't require participation in or endorsement of the ceremony.

The girlfriend's accusation that he's ""putting his religion before her feelings and our relationship"" seems accurate in this context. His offer to ""drop her off and pick her up"" feels inadequate given the magnitude of what she's going through and what she needs from her partner.

The author has been harboring romantic feelings for 3 years despite a clear rejection. While having feelings isn't inherently wrong, several concerning patterns emerge:

1. He continues pursuing someone who explicitly said no to romance
2. He admits to constantly complimenting her and expressing his feelings despite sensing her discomfort
3. When drunk, he made physical contact (kissing her cheek) and declared his love again
4. He's been discussing their relationship with mutual friends in ways that could make her uncomfortable

The friend has been clear about wanting only friendship and has tried to maintain boundaries. However, the author seems unable or unwilling to truly respect those boundaries, instead hoping his persistence might change her mind.

While being drunk doesn't excuse behavior, it often reveals true intentions. His actions - the kissing, love declaration, and discussing her with friends - suggest he hasn't genuinely accepted her ""no"" and continues to push romantic boundaries in a friendship context.

The friend appears to be trying to maintain the friendship despite his continued romantic pressure, which puts her in an uncomfortable position.

The author is dealing with in-laws who have demonstrated problematic behavior when drinking - including cussing at children, inappropriate criticism of parenting choices, and general rudeness. There's also concerning information about one family member's boyfriend who has a serious drinking problem and potentially abusive behavior. The author wants to establish a no-drinking rule for an upcoming visit when his wife will be pregnant and they'll have children in the house.

The author has legitimate concerns about:
- Past inappropriate behavior when alcohol was involved
- Safety of children and pregnant wife
- Creating a peaceful environment in their own home
- Clear pattern showing the difference in behavior when alcohol is/isn't present

Setting reasonable boundaries for guests in one's own home, especially when children and a pregnant spouse are involved, is not only acceptable but responsible. The author isn't asking them not to drink at all - just not in his house during their visit. The in-laws could choose not to visit if this boundary is unacceptable to them.

The girlfriend expressed insecurity about future relationships, which the author interpreted as her thinking about being with other people. However, this could also be interpreted as anxiety about her self-worth or fear that the relationship dynamic might affect her ability to form healthy relationships in the future.

The author's response was problematic in several ways:
1. Telling someone to ""stop faking"" their insecurities dismisses their emotional experience
2. The aggressive tone (""why the fuck"") shows poor communication skills
3. Rather than trying to understand her concerns, he immediately became defensive

The author has every right to feel disappointed about missing such an important milestone - graduating after overcoming mental health challenges and dropping out is truly significant. Their desire to have their best friend/brother there is completely understandable, and wanting advance notice about attendance is reasonable.

However, the brother is dealing with an imminent birth situation, which is unpredictable by nature. Babies don't follow schedules, and when labor begins, it becomes the immediate priority. The brother likely didn't have much advance warning himself about when he'd need to be at the hospital.

While the author's feelings are valid, expecting definitive advance notice for something as unpredictable as childbirth seems unrealistic. The brother was probably hoping he could attend until it became clear the baby was coming soon. This appears to be an unfortunate timing conflict rather than inconsiderate behavior.

The author's reaction - expressing upset that their brother didn't ""use his words"" - seems to overlook the unpredictable nature of the situation their brother is facing.

The author is facing a genuine dilemma between helping a friend in crisis and protecting a new relationship. The friend is going through a divorce due to infidelity and needs housing - this is a legitimate emergency situation. However, the author has valid concerns about how a long-term houseguest with a ""big personality"" might impact a 3-month relationship that's going well.

The author isn't refusing to help entirely - they're considering alternatives like short-term housing. They're being thoughtful about the situation rather than making a snap decision. The friend made a reasonable request given his circumstances, and there's no indication he's being pushy or unreasonable about it.

The girlfriend isn't mentioned as having any particular stance or making demands, so she doesn't appear to be at fault for anything.

This seems like a situation where everyone has legitimate needs and concerns, but no one is acting badly or unreasonably.

3. Got banned, then the next day sought out the same streamer in a different chat

The author's girlfriend came to him with what should be joyful news - a pregnancy they've been discussing. Instead of celebrating together, he immediately questioned the validity of her test and asked her to take another one ""just to be sure."" When she understandably became upset at having her word questioned on such an intimate matter, he doubled down and mentioned wanting DNA tests too.

While the author frames this as being about ""being sure"" rather than trust, these are functionally the same thing. Asking someone to prove something they've told you inherently communicates that you don't trust their word. His comparison to ""horror stories"" he's heard suggests he's applying worst-case scenarios to his own relationship without any specific reason to doubt his girlfriend.

The girlfriend's reaction - feeling hurt that her partner immediately questioned such personal news and viewing this as a fundamental trust issue - is completely reasonable. Pregnancy is already an emotionally charged situation, and having your partner's first response be skepticism rather than support would be deeply hurtful.

The author's statement that this could be a ""dealbreaker"" if she doesn't comply with his demand shows he's prioritizing his need for verification over her feelings and their relationship dynamics.

The author's family was dealing with someone who was openly racist, antisemitic, and homophobic toward them and their child. The father had made numerous derogatory comments about the author's Jewish identity, used racial slurs, and belittled the author's partner for being LGBT+. The author was expected to tolerate this abuse because their partner prioritized family harmony over their wellbeing.

When the father was furloughed, the author's family invited them for Christmas and went all out with decorations and hospitality. There was supposedly a $20 spending limit agreed upon by the parents. However, the author's family then gave extremely expensive gifts (laptops, PS4, $900 hunting scope) while receiving modest gifts in return.

The mother's comment ""oh, it must be something to do with our religion- I guess we don't really understand Christmas"" appears to be a deliberate dig, suggesting this wasn't an innocent cultural misunderstanding but a calculated move to embarrass the father.

While the father's racist behavior was absolutely inexcusable, the author's family's actions seem designed to humiliate him when he was already in a vulnerable financial position. This appears to be retaliation rather than genuine generosity, especially given the agreed-upon spending limit and the pointed comment afterward.

The author deliberately encouraged their roommate to start vaping with the explicit goal of having a convenient source to buy pods from - essentially using their roommate's potential addiction for personal convenience. This shows clear self-serving motivation rather than concern for the roommate's wellbeing. The author actively facilitated the roommate's entry into regular nicotine use by repeatedly offering their device and eventually encouraging her to buy her own.

However, the roommate was an adult who made her own choices. She had previous experience with nicotine products, was in a college environment where vaping was normalized, and ultimately decided to purchase her own device and continue using it. The author didn't force anything - they influenced and facilitated, but the roommate had agency in her decisions.

The author acknowledges feeling bad about contributing to the addiction, showing some awareness of their role, but also tries to minimize responsibility by suggesting it would have happened anyway.

- They claimed all foster homes were full while simultaneously posting that all other animals had been adopted (contradicting their excuse)
- They didn't adequately support a foster parent dealing with behavioral issues for 6 months
- They only found a solution when threatened, suggesting they could have acted sooner

The author (foster parent):
- Clearly communicated their limitations upfront (couldn't keep through holidays)
- Invested significant personal time and money in training and care
- Made reasonable requests for help and alternative placement
- Escalated appropriately when the situation became untenable
- Made an empty threat out of frustration, but this was after 6 months of inadequate support

While the threat wasn't ideal, it was made in desperation after months of the rescue failing to fulfill their basic responsibilities. The author was doing far more than expected (paying for food, training, transportation) while the rescue wasn't doing their part (advertising, finding alternatives when requested).

The rescue's ability to immediately find an adopter after the threat proves they could have resolved this much earlier but chose not to prioritize it.

The guy then escalated to public verbal abuse, calling her a ""whore"" and making cruel comments about her appearance unprovoked.

While the author's response about his sexual performance was also hurtful and public, it came as a direct reaction to his initial attack. She was defending herself against someone who was publicly humiliating her first. The fact that he continues to harass her afterward, blaming her for ruining his chances with someone else, further demonstrates his poor character and lack of accountability.

The author is dealing with a father who has had many relationships since his divorce, and now is dating someone the author's own age. The author has previously made efforts to connect with their father's partners but is drawing boundaries this time. Their reasoning includes:
- The relationship seems potentially not serious (girlfriend hasn't told her family about the father)
- They have a small wedding with limited guest list
- They only see their father monthly
- The significant age gap makes them uncomfortable

However, the author is also potentially missing some important considerations:
- This relationship has lasted a year, which may indicate more seriousness than previous ones
- The father has repeatedly tried to facilitate meetings, suggesting this relationship matters to him
- Completely refusing to meet someone important to their father could strain their close relationship
- The wedding invitation issue is separate from just meeting her

The father seems to genuinely want his daughter to know this person who is important to him, which is understandable. The girlfriend's situation with her family, while concerning, may not fully reflect the seriousness of her feelings.

The fiancée is trying to encourage inclusivity, which comes from a good place.

While the author has valid concerns and the right to set boundaries, completely shutting out someone who has been in their father's life for a year - especially given their previously close relationship - seems unnecessarily rigid.

While the parent's intention to promote health is understandable, there are several concerning aspects:

1. Creating different food rules for children in the same household based on weight can lead to shame, resentment, and unhealthy relationships with food
2. A 9-year-old is still developing, and what appears as ""overweight"" may indeed be normal developmental changes
3. The approach of telling a child ""life isn't fair"" regarding food restrictions while siblings eat freely could be psychologically damaging
4. This differential treatment may create long-term issues with self-esteem and body image

The grandmother raises valid concerns about potential future problems. Research suggests that restrictive dieting in childhood, especially when other family members don't follow the same rules, can lead to disordered eating patterns, increased preoccupation with food, and even weight gain over time.

A healthier approach would involve making nutritious changes for the entire family rather than singling out one child, focusing on overall health and activity rather than weight, and consulting with pediatric nutrition experts.

The parent's heart is in the right place, but the execution is problematic and could cause more harm than good.

Nail clipping is a standard, veterinarian-recommended practice for indoor cats. It's much more humane than declawing and helps prevent damage to furniture and injury to humans. The author is getting ""deep, red, angry scratches"" from the cats, which indicates a legitimate need for nail maintenance.

The boyfriend's opposition seems to be based on personal preference rather than the cats' wellbeing or any practical concerns. His argument that he's ""had cats his whole life"" and finds it ""weird"" doesn't override the clear need for nail trimming when the cats are causing injury. His continued ""pissy"" behavior after agreeing to the nail clipping suggests he's being unreasonably stubborn about a reasonable pet care practice.

The author is making personal decisions about their child's religious ceremonies based on their own beliefs and comfort level. They're not religious and don't want to participate in ceremonies they don't believe in, which is a reasonable personal choice. Parents have the right to make decisions about their children's religious upbringing.

The family members are disappointed and hurt that important religious traditions won't be observed, and they're expressing this by not attending the baby shower. While their feelings are understandable given their religious beliefs, refusing to attend the baby shower seems like an overreaction that could damage family relationships. They're essentially punishing the couple for making different religious choices.

The family is also trying to impose their religious practices on someone who has clearly stated they don't share those beliefs, even after being told no multiple times.

Both sides have legitimate feelings and perspectives, but the family's response of boycotting the baby shower crosses a line from disappointment into punitive behavior that could harm family relationships long-term.

The author's girlfriend clearly established a boundary - she didn't want to participate in the peep show but was okay with her partner going alone. The author respected this initially by going in solo. However, when the opportunity arose to go into a booth with a stranger, the author made a decision that crossed into territory that wasn't previously discussed or agreed upon.

While the author's intention seems innocent (making the experience less awkward), going into an intimate/sexual setting with another person when your partner is waiting outside represents a significant boundary crossing. The fact that the girlfriend seemed okay with it initially doesn't negate that this was problematic - sometimes people need time to process their feelings about boundary violations.

The author's final comment ""if she had just come in with me none of this would've happened"" is particularly concerning as it shifts blame to the girlfriend for maintaining her clearly stated boundary, rather than taking responsibility for the choice to engage in this activity with a stranger.

The girlfriend established clear boundaries and communicated them well. Her later reaction, while delayed, is understandable given the nature of what happened.

The girlfriend made a significant mistake by inviting her entire family to their shared living space without consulting her partner first, especially after he had already declined the original invitation to study for exams. This shows a lack of respect for shared space and his academic priorities.

However, the author also bears some responsibility. He admits to being less responsive and warm toward her family due to communication barriers and awkwardness, which likely contributed to underlying tension. When the conflict arose, while he did attempt a compromise by going to Starbucks, the overall dynamic suggests he may not have been fully engaged in finding a solution that honored both his needs and her desire to host family.

The girlfriend's defensive response and accusation that he has ""no respect for her family"" was unfair, but it likely stems from his admitted distance from her family over time.

This appears to be a situation where both parties made mistakes - she in making unilateral decisions about their shared space, and he in not being more proactive about addressing the underlying family relationship issues before they reached this point.

- Had experienced years of mistreatment from their stepmother
- Felt unsupported by their father during this mistreatment
- Only returned to live with their father out of necessity to finish high school
- Made the reasonable decision to pursue higher education when accepted to college
- Was given an ultimatum between college and staying home

The father and stepmother:
- Had a pattern of allowing/perpetrating emotional abuse toward both children

The author is in a relationship where they discussed opening things up sexually due to mismatched libidos. The boyfriend gave what appears to be consent with ""you do you,"" though this seems like a significant change from his previous stance. However, the author is now considering pursuing a workplace crush, which raises several concerns:

1. The boyfriend's consent seems somewhat ambiguous - ""you do you"" could indicate genuine agreement or reluctant acceptance
2. Workplace relationships can create complications and potential issues
3. The author seems to be moving forward without ensuring clear, enthusiastic consent and proper boundaries

While the boyfriend did give some form of permission, the casual nature of his response and the fact that this represents a major shift in his previous boundaries suggests this situation needed much more thorough discussion. The author appears to be rushing into acting on this without ensuring proper communication about boundaries, expectations, and genuine consent from their partner.

The lack of clear, detailed communication about what this arrangement means for their relationship puts the primary responsibility on the author for not ensuring proper consent and boundaries were established.

Her hanging up when confronted shows she knows her behavior is problematic.

However, the author and siblings also handled this poorly. While their frustration is understandable, ganging up on their mother via group text was unnecessarily harsh and coordinated in a way that seems designed to shame her. The author's response was particularly cutting, essentially calling their mother a liar in front of the whole family. There were more constructive ways to address these legitimate concerns.

The adopted family isn't really at fault for asking again - when someone helps you once, it's natural (if perhaps presumptuous) to ask for help again when in need.

The author received a GameCube as a gift, but it came without essential components (cables and power supply) needed to actually use it.

Importantly, the author discussed this with their girlfriend - the gift giver - who completely understood and wasn't offended. She even suggested using the gifted GameCube as a backup, showing she recognizes the practical limitations of what she gave.

The housemates are calling the author ungrateful, but this seems misplaced. The author:

- Consulted knowledgeable sources about solutions
- Got explicit permission/understanding from the gift giver

The friend also made questionable decisions:

However, the privacy violation is the most serious issue here. Sharing intimate details about someone's sexual experience without their consent is a significant betrayal of trust, especially when that person was exploring their sexuality in what they thought was a private, safe space.

While their financial situation may have changed, expecting the remaining friends to absorb their costs or do the work of finding alternative accommodation seems unreasonable. The friend is essentially asking others to bear the consequences of their withdrawal.

The author's position is fair - they're not demanding the friend come on the trip, just that they honor their financial commitment or take responsibility for finding a solution that doesn't burden others.

While the friend should have respected the clearly stated boundary, the physical response was severely disproportionate to having snow rubbed on one's face. Punching someone multiple times in the head over a snowball incident, even after giving a warning, represents an extreme escalation that could cause serious injury.

- Called his female friend his ""soulmate"" to his fiancée
- Said his relationship with his friend ""comes once in a lifetime"" 
- Told his fiancée he ""loves"" another woman
- Dismisses his fiancée's emotional responses as manipulation (""she does this a lot to get her way"")
- Shows little empathy for how his words and actions affect his fiancée
- Seems to prioritize his friend's feelings over his fiancée's consistently

The fiancée's concerning behaviors:
- Made cruel comments that nearly drove the friend to tears
- Demanded the friend not be invited to the wedding
- Has been ""hostile"" to both the author and his friend

However, the fiancée's jealousy and discomfort, while expressed poorly, stems from genuinely problematic behavior from her partner. The author is essentially telling his fiancée that another woman is his ""soulmate"" and that he loves her - this would be deeply hurtful and threatening to most romantic partners. His language and priorities suggest he may not be emotionally available for his fiancée in the way a life partner should be.

While the fiancée handled her concerns poorly by being cruel to the friend, the root issue appears to be the author's inappropriate emotional boundaries and insensitive communication about his relationship with another woman.

However, the post doesn't clearly describe any specific action the author has taken that would make them ""at fault"" for something.

The title reference and ""So, AITA?"" suggests they're asking about some decision or action, but the actual scenario presented is more of a description of family dynamics rather than a specific incident where fault could be assigned. Without knowing what specific action or decision they're questioning, it's difficult to determine if anyone is truly at fault.

The author tampered with someone's food based solely on hearsay from their manager, without any verification. Food tampering is dangerous, potentially illegal, and a serious violation of food service ethics - regardless of the customer's alleged beliefs or affiliations. Even if the customer had actually been a KKK member, this wouldn't justify contaminating their food.

The manager deliberately lied and manipulated the author into committing food tampering to carry out a personal vendetta against someone who got a promotion over them. This is an abuse of authority and extremely unethical behavior.

However, the customer (the fire chief) appears to be completely innocent - he was simply ordering food and became the victim of workplace retaliation he wasn't even aware of.

While the manager's manipulation was deplorable, the author still made the choice to tamper with food without verifying the claims or considering the serious consequences. Both parties acted wrongly, but in different ways - the manager through deception and abuse of power, and the author through dangerous food tampering.

The roommate rescued a cat in cold weather (which is admirable) but has several concerning issues:
- Has a history of being late on rent/utilities, indicating financial irresponsibility
- Brought a flea-infested animal into a shared living space without proper veterinary care
- Admits he doesn't have money for basic pet care (vet visits, shots, etc.)
- Is planning to leave in 2 months and likely won't have money to properly clean his room
- Is trying to find temporary care for the cat while traveling, showing he can't fully commit to pet ownership

The author/lease holder:
- Has legitimate concerns about fleas spreading in the shared space
- Is worried about the financial burden and proper care of the animal
- Recognizes there's nothing explicitly forbidding pets in their agreement
- Is considering asking the roommate to rehome the cat temporarily
- Actually likes the cat but is being practical about the situation

The roommate took on a responsibility (pet ownership) that he clearly cannot afford, potentially exposing the shared living space to pests, and is creating problems for others due to his financial limitations. While his intention to rescue the cat was good, his execution shows poor judgment and consideration for his roommate.

The author is trying to balance compassion with practical concerns about their living situation and the cat's welfare.

The behaviors described - copying, creating drama when not invited to events, dumping responsibilities on others, paranoia/trust issues, manipulation through guilt-tripping, and using other friends to pressure the author - are problematic friendship behaviors regardless of anyone's gender identity or transition status.

The author appears to have tried to address these issues directly through communication, setting boundaries about responsibilities, and even suggesting the friend might want to end the friendship if she's so unhappy with it. The friend has refused to modify the behaviors and instead escalated by calling the author names and using social pressure tactics.

The author is now considering reducing contact rather than completely cutting off the friendship, which seems like a reasonable response to an unhealthy dynamic. The timing coinciding with the transition appears to be correlational rather than the author having issues with the transition itself - the focus is entirely on specific behavioral patterns that are affecting their wellbeing.

While it's possible the friend is dealing with stress related to her transition, this doesn't excuse manipulative or demanding behavior toward friends. Everyone deserves to have their boundaries respected in friendships.

The rest was from quizzes ...,Other,Everybody,0.72,0.7272727272727273,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives of both the student and the professor, as well as the institutional context.

The professor clearly faced a genuine medical emergency that significantly impacted her ability to perform her duties. Breaking both wrists would make grading essays extremely difficult or impossible without assistance. Her initial communication about potential delays was appropriate.

However, the student also had legitimate concerns. By the time the 5th essay was due with no feedback on any previous work, they were facing a real academic dilemma - potentially failing a course they were paying for without any way to know their standing or improve their performance. The student's email suggesting alternative solutions (like dictating grades) was reasonable and constructive.

The professor's ""furious"" response to what appears to have been a respectfully worded inquiry was unprofessional, even considering her difficult circumstances. While her injury was traumatic, the student wasn't being unreasonable in seeking some form of feedback or accommodation after months of silence.

The university system also bears some responsibility here - there should have been institutional support to help manage the situation, such as providing a teaching assistant, arranging for temporary coverage, or offering students the option to withdraw without penalty.

This appears to be a situation where everyone could have handled things better, but the core issues stem from inadequate institutional support for both the injured professor and the paying students.

The author has been with his girlfriend for over a year, which is a significant relationship duration. Meeting family members, especially her son, and attending important family events like birthdays are reasonable expectations at this stage. The girlfriend isn't asking for something unreasonable - she wants her partner to be part of important family moments and to meet her relatives.

However, the author seems resistant to integrating into her family life. He dismisses her parents as ""boring cordial,"" questions whether he should attend her son's birthday, and prioritizes watching football with friends over what his girlfriend clearly considers an important relationship milestone. His attitude suggests he's not fully committed to being part of her family unit.

While everyone has the right to decline invitations, after a year together, consistently avoiding family integration sends a message about his commitment level. The girlfriend's frustration is understandable - she's trying to build a life that includes him, and he's showing reluctance to participate in meaningful family moments.

The author seems to be treating this relationship more casually than his girlfriend does, which creates a fundamental mismatch in expectations.

The facts are clear: Someone has repeatedly reposted the author's artwork without permission or credit, despite the author's signature being visible. The reposter is using ""OC"" (original content) hashtags, which strongly suggests they're trying to pass the work off as their own creation. This has happened twice with the same person, and they've ignored previous requests to remove the content.

The author is dealing with a father who has severe, untreated bipolar disorder that manifests in overwhelming communication patterns (sending 7 lengthy texts at a time, constant messaging about grievances and demands for caregiving). The author has their own mental health struggles (anxiety, depression) and physical health issues (stomach problems) that are being exacerbated by this situation.

A medical professional advised the author to limit responses because engaging with these behaviors can actually reinforce them and discourage the father from seeking proper treatment. The author is following this advice and feeling better, but feels guilty about it.

The father appears to be unwell and not receiving appropriate treatment, which explains but doesn't excuse the overwhelming and demanding communication pattern. However, his mental illness makes him less culpable for his behavior.

The author is trying to protect their own mental health while dealing with a very difficult family situation. Setting boundaries with a mentally ill family member, especially when advised by a healthcare professional, is not only reasonable but necessary for both parties' wellbeing.

This appears to be a tragic situation where mental illness is creating harm, but the author's response (setting boundaries on medical advice) is appropriate self-care, not abandonment.

The author has legitimate concerns about:
- Strangers being in the home unaccompanied by the roommate
- Guests using their personal bathroom while they bear the cost of supplies
- Noise disruption from guests when the roommate isn't even present
- The emergency key being used for non-emergency social purposes

These are reasonable boundaries for shared living spaces. Most roommate agreements would consider having guests over without the host present to be inappropriate, especially when it affects the other roommate's comfort, privacy, and expenses.

The roommate's behavior appears inconsiderate - allowing friends to use the space as if it's their own hangout spot while not being present, and not ensuring her guests respect the shared living situation or contribute to bathroom supplies they're using.

The author is asking if they would be wrong to address this issue, which shows they're trying to handle it appropriately through communication rather than escalating unnecessarily.

The author is the speech captain trying to help a new team member who didn't make semi-finals and was expressing frustration about not receiving helpful feedback. The new member was clearly upset and looking for support or guidance.

Telling someone who is already stressed and upset to ""buck up"" and stop ""crying about it"" shows a lack of empathy and poor leadership skills. When the new member explained she was already performing at her highest level and didn't know what to fix, the author continued to be confrontational rather than constructive.

As speech captain, the author had a responsibility to provide actual guidance and support, not just tough love that clearly wasn't appropriate for the situation. The fact that the interaction escalated to the point where the new member started crying and walked away suggests the author's approach was counterproductive.

While the author may have had good intentions in trying to motivate the team member, the execution was poor and insensitive.

However, the author's decision to do everything alone without giving a final heads-up or ultimatum was somewhat inconsiderate. A simple ""I'm planning to do this today if you don't want to join"" could have prevented hurt feelings.

The husband's reaction (""What the fuck is the point?"") was disproportionately harsh and dismissive, especially given his pattern of avoidance and lack of follow-through on something he had initially shown interest in.

The friend's interpretation wasn't unreasonable given the context - being allowed to try on the item while the author was undecided, combined with the ambiguous ""up to you"" comment, could reasonably signal that the author was letting them have it.

However, the author never explicitly gave up the shirt and ultimately decided they wanted to purchase it. The friend's insistence that the shirt was ""forfeited"" seems like an overreach, especially since the author found it first and their intent was never clearly communicated as giving it up.

This was done without any communication or consent from her. While his mental health struggles and low self-esteem provide context for his behavior, they don't excuse the impact of his actions.

From the coworker's perspective, she was left in an extremely awkward and potentially unsafe situation - suddenly having dinner with a complete stranger who had been given her date's flowers and reservation.

The author's husband decided to try growing a beard - a personal choice about his own appearance. While the author may genuinely dislike how it looks, her approach was problematic in several ways:

1. She enlisted others (friends and family) in criticizing his appearance, which likely made him feel ganged up on and humiliated
2. She directly told him to ""quit growing it"" and ""shave"" - essentially demanding he change his body to suit her preferences
3. She dismissed his valid point about bodily autonomy by responding ""Like what?"" when he pointed out the double standard
4. Her stated motivation of protecting him from mockery rings hollow since she was actively participating in that mockery

The husband's comparison to sexist behavior is actually quite apt - telling a partner what to do with their body based on your aesthetic preferences is controlling regardless of gender. His anger is understandable given that his wife organized what amounts to a campaign against his personal grooming choice.

The author is expressing discomfort about what they perceive as unusual physical boundaries between their girlfriend and her brother. However, sibling relationships can vary significantly between families and cultures. What seems inappropriate to one person might be completely normal family behavior to another.

The key issues here are:
1. The author is judging their girlfriend's family dynamics based on their own standards
2. The girlfriend is defensive about her family relationships, which is understandable
3. There's a fundamental mismatch in comfort levels and boundaries

While the author has a right to feel uncomfortable, calling their girlfriend's relationship with her brother ""not right"" and ""weird"" crosses into judgment territory about her family. Different families have different comfort levels with physical affection and privacy boundaries. The author is essentially asking their girlfriend to change long-established family dynamics to accommodate their discomfort.

The girlfriend's reaction, while defensive, is also understandable - she's being told her normal family relationships are inappropriate by someone she's only been dating for 4 months.

The family attempts to create a positive atmosphere and spend time together. These aren't inherently bad things, even if the execution feels forced.

However, the author's communication became unnecessarily harsh and dismissive. Suggesting the girlfriend sleep outside in -20°C weather was clearly sarcastic and mean-spirited, even if not meant literally. The comment about sleeping ""like a baby"" while knowing she didn't sleep at all showed a lack of empathy.

The girlfriend's initial request, while unreasonable, came from not understanding the consequences for the fish. However, she continued complaining after being told it could endanger the animals, showing little consideration for their welfare. She also rejected the reasonable compromise of sleeping upstairs.

The sister-in-law scheduled her daughter's birthday party on the same day as the author's daughter's actual birthday, with very short notice (calling the day of the party). This appears to be either extremely poor planning or potentially deliberate given the established pattern of jealousy issues. The author had already made special plans for her daughter's actual birthday and had recently thrown a proper party for her daughter earlier in the month.

The author politely declined and explained they had existing plans and that it was her daughter's birthday. This seems reasonable - you can't expect people to drop their plans for a last-minute party invitation, especially when it conflicts with their own child's birthday celebration.

The sister-in-law's behavior of calling multiple times during the author's Christmas party, along with having her daughter call repeatedly, seems inappropriate and manipulative. The pattern described over 4 years suggests the sister-in-law consistently prioritizes her daughter's feelings over reasonable boundaries.

While family relationships require some flexibility and compromise, the author was not obligated to abandon her own daughter's birthday plans for a last-minute party invitation. The timing appears either thoughtless or intentionally problematic.

So I ended up breaking ...",Author,Author,0.75,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the agreement made and the responsibilities of each party.

The author had a clear agreement with their friend: they could use the spare phone with the condition that it would be returned if the friend's current phone broke. When the author broke the borrowed phone, they chose to buy themselves a new phone instead of fixing the borrowed one or returning it in working condition.

Now the friend and mutual friend are asking the author to fix the original borrowed phone to help the mutual friend who lost her phone. The author is refusing because the repair would essentially cost as much as a new phone.

The key issue here is that the author broke something that belonged to someone else and never made it right. When you borrow something and break it, you're generally responsible for replacing or repairing it. The author's decision to buy themselves a new phone instead doesn't absolve them of responsibility for the borrowed phone they damaged.

The friend was generous in lending the phone, and the mutual friend's phone loss, while unfortunate, doesn't change the fundamental obligation the author has to make good on the damaged borrowed property.

The author handled this respectfully - he asked the group for permission before adding his wife to their existing arrangement, and when one member objected, he didn't force the issue. Instead, he found a compromise by starting his own account and buying adjacent seats. This allows his wife to attend games while preserving the original group's dynamic.

The friend's response seems unreasonable on multiple levels. First, calling it ""guy time"" when there are already women in the group (based on context clues) is inconsistent. Second, and more importantly, after explicitly saying no to the wife joining their group, he's now complaining that the author found an alternative solution that doesn't affect their group at all. The author respected the boundary that was set, then created his own separate arrangement.

The friend appears to want it both ways - he doesn't want the wife in their group, but also doesn't want the author to have any independent solution. This seems controlling and unreasonable, especially given that the author's solution doesn't impact the original group's experience.

The author was also dropping hints that the sons should buy a new TV, but didn't communicate directly with them or set clear boundaries with the mother-in-law about what they were willing to do.

The author made plans with a female friend spontaneously without giving his girlfriend a heads up, which in a committed 4+ year relationship could reasonably be expected. However, when directly asked where he was and who he was with, he was honest and transparent. The girlfriend's response - sending multiple berating snaps comparing this outing to activities she wanted to do with him - seems disproportionate and controlling.

While better communication upfront might have prevented this conflict, the girlfriend's pattern of ""unreasonable jealousy"" (as the author describes it happening multiple times) and her method of handling the situation through repeated accusatory messages suggests the primary issue lies with her reaction rather than his failure to proactively communicate about spontaneous plans.

The author was dealing with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis, surgery, and chemotherapy - objectively serious medical circumstances that typically warrant support from close relationships. His expectation for visits or support during this time seems reasonable for a romantic partner.

The ex-girlfriend was under stress from medical school, which is genuinely demanding. However, her response - expecting him to make 5-hour drives both before and after chemo, providing no visits during his treatment, and then breaking up with him via text while citing ""how he treated her"" - suggests a significant lack of empathy and support during his medical crisis.

While the author admits to ""calling out her character,"" this appears to have happened after months of feeling unsupported during cancer treatment. His frustration seems understandable given the circumstances.

The ex-girlfriend's statement that ""her world doesn't stop spinning because something happens to me"" regarding his cancer diagnosis is particularly telling about her perspective on the relationship and his medical situation.

Medical school stress, while real, doesn't typically justify the level of apparent indifference shown toward a partner's cancer treatment.

The boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic - he ""attacked"" the author and the tattoo, made harsh criticisms calling it marker-like and childish, and hung up on her when she told the truth. His claim that he ""accepted"" the tattoo is contradicted by his consistently negative reactions. A supportive partner wouldn't tear down something meaningful to their girlfriend, especially her first tattoo that has personal significance.

However, the author did lie to avoid conflict, which she acknowledges was wrong. While understandable given his harsh reaction, lying about something permanent like a tattoo was bound to create bigger problems later.

That said, the boyfriend's behavior is the primary issue here. His criticism was cruel and unsupportive, and his reaction to being lied to (more yelling and hanging up) shows he hasn't learned to communicate respectfully. The lie was a defensive response to his poor treatment, not the root cause of the conflict.

The boyfriend bears the greater responsibility for creating a hostile environment where his girlfriend felt she needed to lie to avoid his attacks on something meaningful to her.

However, their response was inappropriate and escalatory. Even after their father explicitly told them not to make the gesture, they deliberately disobeyed and flipped off the other driver with both hands. This was disrespectful to both their father's authority and unnecessarily aggressive toward the other driver.

The mother's behavior is highly problematic:
- Pressuring a 16-year-old about having children is completely inappropriate
- Specifically asking for ""BIOLOGICAL grandchildren"" shows concerning attitudes about adoption/surrogacy
- Calling her teenage daughter ""selfish"" for not wanting kids is manipulative and hurtful
- Storming off dramatically when challenged shows poor emotional regulation
- The entire conversation puts unfair pressure and expectations on a minor

The author (16-year-old):
- Was put in an uncomfortable, inappropriate situation by an adult
- Responded with understandable frustration after being pressured
- Told their mother to ""basically shut up"" - while not the most polite phrasing, this was a reasonable boundary-setting attempt given the circumstances
- Was defending their right to make their own reproductive choices

While the author could have used more diplomatic language, they were a teenager responding to inappropriate pressure from their parent about a very personal topic.

The husband is struggling with untreated depression, which is a serious mental health condition that can significantly impact behavior and relationships. However, depression doesn't excuse harmful behavior patterns or absolve someone of responsibility for seeking help when their condition is damaging their family.

Key factors:
- The husband has refused therapy and medication for years despite the clear impact on his family
- He has established a pattern of emotional withdrawal, anger, and shutting out his wife for days
- He made threats about hiding money and self-harm when she tried to establish independence
- While he showed temporary improvement in counseling, he's reverted to harmful patterns
- The wife has tried multiple approaches including separation, counseling, and accommodation

The wife has made extensive efforts to support the relationship and accommodate his condition, even moving out temporarily to create space for change. She's not abandoning him during a brief rough patch - this is a 17-year pattern of untreated mental health issues affecting the entire family.

While mental illness explains behavior, it doesn't excuse the refusal to seek treatment when that refusal harms others, especially when a child is involved. The husband bears primary responsibility for managing his condition and its impact on his family.

The friend would still be getting a very good deal compared to other options.

This seems like a reasonable business transaction between friends. The author is:
- Still providing their friend with substantial savings compared to market price
- Taking on the risk and effort of the transaction
- Only adding a modest markup that's well below what they could charge others
- Being transparent about considering this approach

The friend benefits significantly from the author's connection and still gets a great price. A small markup for facilitating the transaction and taking on associated risks seems fair, especially when the friend is still saving considerable money.

The author acknowledges they are ""intentionally misleading"" their friends by saying papers are ""fine"" when they contain ""multiple mistakes.""

By giving false feedback, the author is potentially allowing their friends to submit subpar work that could affect their grades.

While I understand the author's reluctance to spend significant time rewriting papers or dealing with complex stylistic issues, there are better alternatives than outright deception. They could:
- Be honest about time constraints
- Point out that there are issues but they don't have time to fix them
- Suggest the friends visit a writing center
- Decline to proofread altogether

The author learned that two male friends are cheating on their girlfriends - one went on an overnight trip with another woman, and the other is essentially maintaining two relationships simultaneously. The author feels uncomfortable continuing these friendships and wants to distance themselves, while the other friends think this is an overreaction since they don't know the girlfriends being hurt.

The author's response seems to stem from a genuine moral discomfort with infidelity and a belief that character matters in friendships. They're not demanding others cut contact, threatening to expose the cheating, or being dramatic - they simply want to personally distance themselves from behavior they find morally objectionable. This is a reasonable boundary to set based on personal values.

The friends calling it an ""overreaction"" seems dismissive of legitimate moral concerns. While they're entitled to their own boundaries about what they'll tolerate in friendships, characterizing the author's principled stance as excessive seems unfair.

The author is being thoughtful about their response - they'd still be cordial in group settings and aren't trying to blow up the entire friend group. They're simply choosing not to actively maintain individual relationships with people whose behavior conflicts with their values.

The facts are clear: Friend C stole $1000 from the author's parents during a party at their house, was caught on video surveillance, and when confronted, showed no remorse by saying the parents are rich so it shouldn't matter. This is a serious crime and betrayal of trust.

The author's response to cut ties with friend C is completely justified. However, the core issue is whether the author is wrong for giving friends A and B an ultimatum - essentially forcing them to choose between maintaining friendship with the author or with friend C.

While I understand the author feels betrayed that their long-time friends don't seem to take the theft seriously, issuing ultimatums in friendships is generally problematic. Friends A and B aren't condoning the theft by choosing not to get involved - they're trying to maintain neutrality in a difficult situation. The author is essentially punishing them for not taking the same strong stance they did.

The author has every right to feel hurt and disappointed, but demanding that friends choose sides puts them in an unfair position. The appropriate response would have been to express disappointment in their reaction while allowing them to make their own decisions about their relationships.

The friend, however, appears to be stuck in a cycle of seeking comfort without taking action to address her problems.

The author is using student finance (which comes from taxpayer money) to send money to their cousin in Asia rather than for their own living expenses as a student. While their intentions are good - helping family rather than spending on ""nights out and alcohol"" - there's a legitimate question about whether this is the intended use of these funds.

The author is clearly frustrated and overwhelmed by a difficult living situation that was imposed on them. They've taken on full-time caregiving responsibilities for both their own child and their nephew, while also being a full-time student. Their concerns about their nephew's behavior affecting their own child are legitimate parenting concerns.

However, the author's language is extremely harsh toward an 8-year-old child who has just experienced another family disruption and is likely struggling with the instability. Calling a child a ""whiniest little shit,"" saying he ""sucks at life,"" and expressing hatred toward him crosses a line, even in a venting context.

The sister appears to be contributing to the problem by not maintaining consistent discipline and ""giving in to tantrums,"" which undermines the author's efforts and confuses both children about boundaries.

The 8-year-old nephew is displaying challenging behaviors, but he's a child dealing with family instability and adjustment issues, which explains (though doesn't excuse) his actions.

This seems like a situation where multiple parties bear some responsibility - the author for their extreme reaction and language toward a child, and the sister for not properly managing her son's behavior or coordinating parenting approaches in a shared household.

The author saw teachers giving their teacher a giant teddy bear, and the teacher didn't appear sad. Given this context, assuming it might be a birthday celebration was actually quite reasonable - teddy bears are common birthday gifts, especially in school settings. The author was genuinely trying to be kind and show interest in what they thought was a positive occasion.

The tragic reality about the teacher's terminally ill mother was completely unknown to the author. While the outcome was unfortunate and created an awkward situation, the author's intentions were good - they were trying to ""make her day better"" and show care for a teacher who wasn't well-liked by most students.

The author also attempted to recover gracefully by offering well-wishes before leaving, showing they recognized the gravity of the situation once it was revealed.

The friends calling the author an ""inconsiderate asshole"" seems harsh given that the author had no way of knowing the true circumstances and was acting with good intentions based on reasonable assumptions.

He kept pressing me for...,Author,Author,0.72,0.8434782608695652,True,"This is a deeply painful situation involving trauma, grief, and self-preservation. The author is dealing with unresolved trauma from losing their brother to cancer at age 13, which has created an understandable but harmful response to their partner's diagnosis.

While the author's trauma response is psychologically understandable, abandoning someone immediately upon learning of their cancer diagnosis - especially someone they presumably cared about enough to be in a relationship with - causes significant harm during an extremely vulnerable time. The timing and manner of the breakup (immediately over the phone, refusing to see them) adds cruelty to an already devastating situation for the partner.

However, the author isn't acting from malice but from genuine psychological distress and self-protection instincts. Their recognition that they need to protect their mental health shows some self-awareness, even if their execution was harmful.

The partner's pressing for reasons, while understandable given the shock, may have pushed the author into a more hurtful explanation than necessary.

This appears to be primarily about the author's trauma response causing harm to others, even if unintentionally.

- Participating in workplace jokes about marrying the coworker and having ""pretty babies""
- Admitting to getting ""a bit too close"" sometimes
- Making a special meal for another man (which can be seen as intimate)
- Regular one-on-one lunches and car rides

The boyfriend's issues:
- Poor communication - holding onto concerns for months without addressing them

- Not expressing his boundaries clearly earlier

However, the author admits to flirty behavior and getting ""too close"" with her coworker, and actively participates in romantic jokes about them at work. While she claims she ""never crossed a line,"" her behavior appears to have crossed reasonable relationship boundaries. The boyfriend's communication could have been better, but his concerns about the relationship seem legitimate given the author's own admissions.

The author purchased and used a personal item without telling their boyfriend, which is generally within their right to personal autonomy. However, they left it in a shared bed where he discovered it, and he felt hurt by not being told about it beforehand. His feelings of being hurt and feeling inferior, while understandable from an emotional standpoint, seem to stem from insecurity rather than any actual wrongdoing by the author.

The author didn't intentionally hide this to deceive or hurt their partner - they simply didn't think to mention a personal purchase. The discovery was accidental due to forgetfulness, not deliberate concealment. The boyfriend's reaction, while emotionally valid, suggests some underlying insecurities about sexual adequacy that aren't really the author's responsibility to manage through disclosure of personal items.

Neither person acted with malicious intent, but the boyfriend's expectation that he should have been told about this personal purchase and his feelings of inferiority place an unreasonable burden on his partner's autonomy.

The author faces a genuine dilemma: they receive compliments on their English based on people's assumptions about their background, but accepting these compliments leads to increasingly uncomfortable follow-up questions and situations where they feel forced to lie. When they tried being honest about English being their first language, they were told this was rude.

The author's response was factual, polite, and included a laugh to keep the tone light. They weren't dismissive or condescending - they simply clarified their background to avoid the cascade of awkward questions and assumptions that typically follow. The alternative (continuing to accept compliments that don't apply to them) creates more problems and discomfort for everyone involved.

The friend who called them rude seems to expect the author to continue accepting misplaced compliments indefinitely, which isn't a reasonable long-term solution. While cultural sensitivity is important, the author has the right to politely correct misconceptions about their own background.

The people giving the compliments aren't at fault either - they're making reasonable assumptions and trying to be kind, even if those assumptions are incorrect.

This appears to be a case where honest, polite communication about one's background shouldn't be considered rude, even if it corrects someone's assumptions.

James's behavior shows significant problems:
- He misled Emma about the nature of their relationship through his actions (exclusive-seeming dates, allowing her to post about his wealth) while maintaining it was just FWB
- He continued seeing other women without clearly communicating the casual nature of their arrangement
- He's pressuring Emma to have an abortion primarily for his own financial/inheritance interests
- His dating profile and behavior seemed designed to attract women with his wealth, which is manipulative

Emma's behavior also has concerning elements:
- She appears to have been attracted to and actively promoted James's wealth on social media
- The timing and her hesitation about abortion after learning about his wealth raises questions about her motivations
- She may be considering keeping the baby partly due to financial considerations

However, the core issue is that both parties engaged in a sexual relationship with different understandings and expectations, leading to an unintended pregnancy. James bears more responsibility because:
1. He had more power/resources in the dynamic
2. He was less clear about boundaries and expectations
3. He's now pressuring her based primarily on his own interests rather than what's best for all involved

While Emma's apparent focus on wealth is problematic, James's deceptive behavior and current pressure tactics make him more at fault.

This kind of avoidance behavior is immature and disrespectful.

There were many better ways to handle the situation - he could have simply walked away, asked her directly what was going on, or just moved on and enjoyed his night with friends.

The author explicitly states they had an ""agenda"" to ""derail her"" and ""systematically"" worked to undermine their colleague's project. They took her data, withheld their own progress, made her dependent on them for help, then abandoned the project when they realized she would get credit for the work. This left her project ""in a shabby state"" through what the author themselves acknowledges was likely sabotage.

The author has been consistently transparent about his fears of commitment and desire to explore other relationships. He communicated his concerns about long-distance and his likelihood to ""explore"" during that time. When given an ultimatum, he proposed a compromise (taking a break), and when that was rejected, he accepted the breakup.

However, the girlfriend then proposed the ""green cards"" arrangement herself as a compromise to salvage some version of their relationship. She actively participated in creating this agreement that explicitly allowed him to be with other people while she traveled.

Now, when the author is about to use one of these agreed-upon opportunities and even gives her advance notice out of courtesy, she expresses hurt - despite this being exactly what they both agreed to.

The author has been honest throughout about his intentions and limitations. The girlfriend created an arrangement she apparently wasn't emotionally prepared for. While her feelings of hurt are understandable and valid, she bears responsibility for agreeing to terms she couldn't handle emotionally.

The author is dealing with music that is so loud they can hear it clearly in every room of their apartment, even with doors closed. This level of noise significantly impacts their ability to enjoy their own living space. While the first incident was close to quiet hours (9:45 PM), the second was at 6 PM - well within normal daytime hours when some noise is expected.

However, the key factor here is the volume level. The author describes it as ""SUPER loud"" and ""might as well have been in my apartment."" This suggests the music exceeds reasonable noise levels for apartment living, regardless of the time. Even outside official quiet hours, tenants have a right to reasonable enjoyment of their homes without excessive noise from neighbors.

The neighbor's immediate response of turning off the music and then leaving for two days suggests they may have been aware the volume was excessive. The author also shows consideration by trying to tolerate it initially and only approaching when it became truly disruptive.

The author's phrasing ""I hate it"" was perhaps unnecessarily harsh, but their core request for reasonable noise levels is legitimate. Apartment living requires mutual consideration, and excessively loud music that penetrates through walls and closed doors crosses that line.

The author is clearly contributing significantly to the household - working 25-30 hours while in school full-time, doing major home improvement projects with their own money, maintaining their own car expenses, and helping with emergency repairs during midterm week. These are substantial contributions that go well beyond typical expectations for a college student.

However, the parents are also providing significant support by covering tuition costs not covered by financial aid and providing housing. The mother's concerns about overnight stays, while potentially overprotective for a 20-year-old, come from a place of parental responsibility while the author lives under their roof.

The core issue seems to be a mismatch in expectations about autonomy versus dependency. The author wants adult-level freedom while still accepting parental financial support and housing. The parents (particularly the mother) want to maintain some level of control while their child lives at home, regardless of the author's contributions.

The author's desire for more autonomy is reasonable given their age and contributions, but their approach of demanding ""new rules"" while continuing to accept financial support creates tension. The parents aren't wrong for having house rules, but the mother's reaction seems disproportionate given the author's maturity and contributions.

The author has a reasonable position that they shouldn't have to kennel their own dog in their own home. However, they're dealing with a 4-year-old who has developed a fear of dogs because the family has consistently accommodated this fear by removing dogs whenever she's present. The child didn't create this situation - the adults in her life did by never helping her overcome her fear.

The sister's behavior is clearly problematic - screaming, cursing, and causing public scenes is inappropriate, especially in front of a child. However, she's also trying to protect her 4-year-old daughter who has a genuine fear.

The real issue here is that the family has created this problem by consistently reinforcing the child's fear instead of addressing it constructively. Everyone has contributed to this dysfunctional pattern, but the immediate conflict escalated due to both the author's inflexibility about their dog and the sister's explosive reaction.

The author could have handled this better by either working with the family beforehand to address the child's fear, or by finding a temporary compromise during the visit.

The author was factually correct - engineering is indeed a highly regulated field that typically requires formal education and licensing for safety reasons (as they confirmed in their edit). Their friend L had an unrealistic plan to enter engineering with only a high school co-op program, which could lead to significant career disappointment.

However, the author's delivery was problematic.

There were much more tactful ways to express concern about their friend's career expectations.

That said, L also contributed to the negative dynamic by adopting a ""holier than thou"" attitude and claiming they could be ""way better than any of us without going to university because they're so smart and bright."" This kind of superiority complex made the conversation more contentious than it needed to be.

The girlfriend's actions seem retaliatory and deliberately hurtful. After their fight, she put up pictures of her deceased ex (including kissing photos) in common areas where their child could see them, and displayed his belongings throughout the house including the bedroom. While grief is understandable, the timing and placement suggest this was done to hurt the author rather than as genuine mourning.

However, the author also bears some responsibility. In a 2+ year relationship with a child involved, keeping a hidden box of mementos from a 5-year relationship (even if forgotten) shows a lack of consideration for the current relationship. While the girlfriend shouldn't have gone through his belongings and thrown things away without permission, her discovery of this box likely felt like a betrayal.

The girlfriend's response was disproportionate and harmful (especially with a child witnessing), but it was triggered by finding evidence that her partner was also holding onto his past relationship.

The author appears to have been genuinely trying to help his wife avoid a painful allergic reaction, based on their established pattern of her needing to leave events early when she drinks without medication. His reminder about the Pepcid AC seems to come from care and concern, especially since they had plans afterward that could be disrupted.

However, the friend's reaction, while perhaps misguided in its intensity, comes from a place of concern about what appeared to be controlling behavior. From an outside perspective, seeing someone tell their partner not to drink could reasonably raise red flags, even if the full context isn't understood.

The wife's role is also important here - she made her own choice to order the drink despite the reminder, which suggests she felt free to make that decision. She didn't finish it, which somewhat validates the author's concern about the consequences.

He's also compromised by agreeing not to smoke when they're together since she doesn't like being around him when he's high.

However, the core issue is that his current routine is genuinely disrupting his wife's sleep, which is a significant problem.

However, the execution was deeply problematic. When her husband was in a vulnerable emotional state, crying and expressing feelings of failure, she:
1. Suggested he quit his job to become a stay-at-home parent (which could feel dismissive of his career ambitions)
2. Bluntly told him his new business idea wouldn't work
3. Called him ""dumb"" (at least in her internal narrative, which likely comes through in her communication)

The timing was particularly poor - responding to someone's emotional vulnerability with harsh practical assessments rather than emotional support first. While honesty in marriage is important, there are more constructive ways to express concerns about repeated business failures.

The husband's reaction (leaving and not returning) suggests he felt deeply hurt and unsupported rather than helped by this approach.

I think it ...",Author,Author,0.72,0.6666666666666666,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the different perspectives and actions involved.

The author is questioning whether they're at fault for feeling upset about spending 30-40 hours tutoring Dan when the teacher knew Dan was terminally ill. They're also questioning the parents' decision not to tell Dan about his terminal condition.

However, the author's reaction seems to miss some important points:

1. The tutoring wasn't wasted - it likely gave Dan a sense of normalcy, purpose, and accomplishment during his remaining time
2. The author did receive something valuable from this experience, even if not the ""extra credit"" they initially hoped for
3. The parents and school were trying to give Dan the most normal, hopeful experience possible in his final months
4. The author's focus on their ""lost time"" rather than the positive impact they had on Dan's life shows a somewhat self-centered perspective

The teacher, parents, and school were all working together to give Dan the best possible end-of-life experience. While one could debate whether Dan should have been told about his condition, that was ultimately his parents' difficult decision to make, and there are valid arguments for wanting to preserve hope and normalcy.

The author isn't terrible for having these thoughts, but their perspective does seem to prioritize their own inconvenience over the meaningful contribution they made to someone's final months of life.

I was fine. I c...,Author,Everybody,0.72,0.5,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the actions and reactions of both parties.

The girlfriend's behavior is problematic in several ways:
- She escalated a playful situation by involving friends to humiliate the author publicly
- She showed no empathy when he was clearly upset and embarrassed
- She refused to apologize or acknowledge his feelings
- She dismissed his emotions as ""childish"" and told him to ""grow up""
- She violated his boundaries by having friends break into the bathroom for photos

However, the author also made mistakes:
- He forced her to get up and dance when she may not have wanted to participate
- He physically picked her up without clear consent
- He became aggressive, cursing repeatedly and knocking a phone out of someone's hand
- He kept bringing up the issue repeatedly instead of having one clear conversation

The girlfriend's actions show a concerning lack of respect for boundaries and empathy. Public humiliation followed by complete dismissal of the partner's feelings is particularly problematic. While the author's initial action of forcing her to dance was inappropriate, her response was disproportionate and cruel.

The author's reaction, while understandable given the humiliation, included some aggressive behavior that wasn't appropriate either.

Both parties contributed to this conflict, but the girlfriend's behavior - particularly the public humiliation and complete lack of empathy - represents the more serious violations.

I ...,Other,Other,0.72,0.9245283018867925,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to evaluate who's at fault when the sister deleted the author's saved game file and the author responded by giving her the silent treatment for a week.

The sister deliberately deleted something that represented hours of the author's time and effort, describing it as ""hilarious."" This was clearly destructive behavior that showed disrespect for her sibling's property and time investment. Even if it's ""just a game,"" it represented real time and enjoyment that was maliciously destroyed.

The author's response of ignoring her for a week, while understandable given the frustration, is somewhat excessive. A brief cooling-off period makes sense, but a week of silent treatment is disproportionate to the offense and creates ongoing family tension.

However, the sister's actions were the clear catalyst here - she committed the initial wrongdoing by deliberately destroying something that mattered to her sibling for her own amusement. The author's reaction, while not ideal, is a natural response to having their time and effort disrespected.

The mother dismissing this as ""just a game"" also minimizes the legitimate frustration of having one's property and time disrespected, though her concern about family harmony is understandable.

While the author could handle this more maturely, the primary fault lies with the sister who initiated this conflict through her deliberate destructive action.

The author experienced trauma flashbacks when receiving compliments, which is understandable given their manipulative ex. However, telling their current boyfriend ""you remind me of my ex"" in response to genuine compliments was hurtful and unfair. The boyfriend was simply being loving and supportive.

The boyfriend's response, while understandably frustrated, was also problematic. Dismissing someone's trauma by saying ""get over your ex"" and minimizing the impact based on the relationship's duration shows a lack of empathy and understanding about how trauma works.

The author initiated the hurtful comparison, but the boyfriend escalated with an insensitive response about trauma recovery. Both parties handled this poorly - the author by projecting past trauma onto innocent behavior, and the boyfriend by being dismissive of trauma responses.

This appears to be a case where both people made mistakes in how they communicated and handled a sensitive situation involving past trauma.

The cashier is following established protocols by asking standard verification questions, which are likely required by Western Union and banking regulations to prevent fraud and money laundering. The answers given by the customer (sending $6000 to someone met in Hong Kong ""for bags"") do raise legitimate red flags that would concern most financial service providers.

The cashier mentions they could lose their job and face fines if they processed a fraudulent transaction, indicating there are real professional and legal consequences for failing to exercise proper judgment. Western Union and similar services specifically train employees to identify suspicious transactions and give them discretion to refuse service for this reason.

While the father's point about not being ""part of the FBI"" has some merit regarding not overstepping boundaries, financial service employees do have a legal and professional obligation to identify potentially fraudulent transactions. The customer's vague answers about the purpose and recipient of such a large sum would reasonably trigger concern.

The ex-boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic - using slurs, being primarily interested in sex, stealing, and creating a situation where someone fears for their safety. However, the author is considering reporting him not out of genuine concern for justice or public safety, but explicitly as retaliation (""to see what it'll do""). 

The author acknowledges they ""didn't have the balls to break up with him"" and waited, which prolonged an unhappy relationship. More significantly, they're contemplating using the legal system as a weapon for personal revenge rather than for its intended purpose.

While the ex's behavior is worse in terms of character and impact, the author's planned action of weaponizing law enforcement for personal vendetta crosses an ethical line. The fact that they're asking about this suggests some awareness that it might be wrong.

The safety concerns mentioned by the mother add complexity, but the author's stated motivation remains retaliatory rather than protective.

They always tell people to bring their dogs over and it's a super dog friendl...",Everybody,Other,0.72,0.375,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the roommate dynamics and communication issues at play.

The author and their partner were watching a friend's dog, which extended longer than originally planned due to the friend's birthday celebration. The dog was well-behaved and caused no problems. However, the roommate (""A"") confronted them afterward in what they describe as a threatening manner, demanding to be notified before bringing dogs over in the future.

Key considerations:
- The author mentions they've all discussed using Rover for dog-sitting income and that it's a ""super dog friendly household""
- The dog caused no actual problems or damage
- The roommate waited until after the dog left to express his concerns
- The author feels they've been exemplary roommates, doing extra cleaning and pet care
- There seems to be a miscommunication about house rules and expectations

While basic roommate courtesy suggests giving a heads up about overnight guests (even furry ones), the roommate's approach was poor - waiting until after the fact and delivering the message in what sounds like an aggressive, threatening manner. Given the established context of this being a dog-friendly household where they'd all discussed pet-sitting, and the fact that no actual problems occurred, the roommate's reaction seems disproportionate.

The author's hurt feelings appear justified given the roommate's confrontational approach and timing.

The author is a student with limited income who doesn't work much, which establishes clear financial constraints. Their brother provided two options, presumably knowing the author's financial situation. The author is still planning to buy a gift that was specifically requested, just choosing the more affordable option.

There's nothing inherently wrong with selecting a gift within your budget, especially when the recipient has given you options. The brother isn't at fault for having preferences or mentioning both books. Gift-giving should be about thoughtfulness within one's means, not about spending the maximum amount possible.

The boyfriend has received 3 speeding tickets in less than a year, including going 63 in a 35 mph zone (28 mph over) and 82 in a 55 mph zone (27 mph over). These are significant speed violations that put both passengers and other drivers at risk. His claim that the tickets ""weren't his fault"" shows a lack of accountability for dangerous driving behavior.

However, the author is also problematic here. She's actively encouraging her boyfriend to speed more and drive faster in various scenarios, even after he's received multiple tickets and is trying to be more cautious. She criticizes him for driving at or near the speed limit, calling it ""overreacting"" and ""unnecessary."" She also admits they're both ""fast drivers"" who ""speed a decent amount.""

The author does show some self-awareness (acknowledging she was wrong about the ""we're going to be late"" repetition) and her snow driving advice seems reasonable given her local experience. But her overall approach of pushing him to speed more, especially given his recent tickets, is counterproductive and potentially dangerous.

The author is in an incredibly difficult position. They're a high school student at a religious school where LGBTQ+ students face harassment, trying to navigate their evolving understanding of their sexuality while protecting both themselves and their ex-girlfriend. The decision to break up was necessary and appropriate once they realized they were gay - staying in the relationship would have been unfair to both parties.

However, the method of breaking up - lying by saying they ""lost feelings"" rather than explaining the real reason - caused unnecessary pain and confusion for their ex-girlfriend. While the author's safety concerns about coming out are completely valid and understandable, this approach left their ex-girlfriend feeling rejected and confused about what went wrong in what she thought was a loving relationship.

The ex-girlfriend's reaction of ""blowing up"" and blocking the author, while hurtful, is an understandable response from someone who feels suddenly rejected without explanation, especially given her history of abuse which likely makes abandonment particularly painful.

The author shows genuine remorse and care for their ex-girlfriend, and their safety concerns are legitimate. The lie was told to protect themselves in a hostile environment, not out of malice.

The author had legitimate reasons for declining:
- They have a clear business policy about not making children's clothing due to practical concerns (short wear time, potential damage, rapid growth)
- They politely declined initially and even provided an alternative contact
- When pressed multiple times, they explained their reasoning respectfully
- They used analogies to help the friend understand their perspective

- She didn't accept the initial polite decline
- She pushed repeatedly after being told no

The author was running a business and has every right to decline work that doesn't align with their business model or personal preferences.

The boyfriend stole his girlfriend's phone and threw it in a river without her knowledge or consent. This is destruction of property and a violation of her personal belongings and privacy. Even though he was frustrated with her academic performance and wanted to help her improve, this approach was completely inappropriate and crossed major boundaries.

While the girlfriend may be underperforming academically despite her intelligence, that's ultimately her choice to make. She's not harming anyone else, and her academic decisions are her own responsibility. The boyfriend had no right to take such drastic action, especially without her consent.

The boyfriend's past experience with similar struggles doesn't justify imposing his solutions on someone else through theft and destruction of property.

While initially reasonable in asking for a partial refund, they escalated to ""full attack mode"" and engaged in a 45-minute confrontational argument, followed by another 30 minutes with the manager.

Your friend explicitly told you he's going through a rough time and needs space - he can't give you a concrete timeline because mental health recovery doesn't work on schedules. When someone is struggling with mental health issues, asking them to predict their healing timeline or to prioritize your need for certainty over their need for space puts additional pressure on them during an already difficult time.

The pattern you describe - having a ""mental breakdown"" and cutting off your ex-friend when she was going through an ""incredibly difficult time"" - suggests this is a recurring issue where your anxiety about being left behind overrides your ability to support friends who are struggling.

The author clearly has established insecurity about playing drums for others - they mention being ""really insecure"" about their ability, not liking to play for people, and only playing for their boyfriend ""a handful of times"" despite his requests. This insecurity seems well-established in their relationship.

The boyfriend's actions show a lack of consideration for his partner's known insecurities. While he may have been excited and proud, posting a private gift (a personal video) on social media without permission crosses a boundary, especially given his awareness of the author's discomfort with performing for others. His subsequent response - calling the author ""ridiculous,"" arguing he could do what he wanted with the gift, and involving a mutual friend to validate his position - shows defensiveness rather than empathy for his partner's distress.

However, the author could have been more explicit about their boundaries when giving the gift, though it's reasonable to assume a personal video gift wouldn't be shared publicly without permission.

The sister's speech, while perhaps not perfectly crafted, appears to have been well-intentioned. She was trying to highlight the husband's character by sharing how he supported her during a difficult time, which actually reflects positively on him as a person the author chose to marry. Mental health struggles are increasingly recognized as normal parts of life that don't need to be hidden or treated as shameful topics.

However, the author's reaction was disproportionately harsh. Even if the speech wasn't ideal, publicly asking the maid of honor (her own sister) to leave the wedding and calling her ""disruptive and selfish"" in front of guests was humiliating and cruel. This created a much bigger scene than the original speech ever did. The fact that the husband and close friends all think the author was too harsh suggests this reaction crossed a line.

While it's understandable that a bride wants her wedding day to focus on her, the extreme response of ejecting her sister from the celebration was unnecessarily punitive and likely caused more disruption than the speech itself.

The author is trying to navigate a complex cultural situation - wanting to introduce her boyfriend to her traditional Chinese parents in a way that maximizes acceptance. Her concern about timing (waiting until he has a job) comes from genuine knowledge of her parents' values and wanting the relationship to succeed long-term.

However, the author made a significant misstep by framing this as a joke (""jokingly said not until he has a job"") rather than having a serious, empathetic conversation about the cultural challenges. This dismissive approach understandably hurt her boyfriend and made him feel like she was ashamed of him.

The boyfriend's feelings of hurt are valid - being told you're not ""good enough"" to meet parents (even jokingly) would sting anyone. However, his reaction seems to lack understanding of the genuine cultural pressures his girlfriend faces. Rather than trying to understand her perspective about family dynamics and cultural expectations, he's interpreting her concerns as shame and making accusations about her feelings toward him and her Asian friends.

Both parties are contributing to this conflict: the author through insensitive communication and the boyfriend through cultural insensitivity and jumping to conclusions about her motivations. Neither is approaching this with the empathy and understanding needed for such a delicate cross-cultural relationship issue.

The author acknowledges several problematic behaviors: engaging in increasingly sexual conversations with someone in a relationship, continuing these conversations despite feeling uncomfortable, not definitively ending contact when advised by a friend that he was destabilizing the relationship, and ultimately sleeping with Sarah while she was still technically with her boyfriend (even though she had decided to leave him).

However, Sarah also bears significant responsibility here. She initiated and persistently drove the sexual conversations despite the author's attempts to redirect them. She made the decision to pursue someone else while in a relationship, chose to be physically affectionate in public, and ultimately made her own choice to leave her boyfriend. Adults are responsible for their own relationship decisions.

The boyfriend appears to have been somewhat neglectful and inconsiderate in the relationship (ignoring Sarah, chatting with other women), which may have contributed to the relationship's vulnerability, though this doesn't justify what happened.

While the author made poor choices and could have been more decisive in ending inappropriate contact, Sarah was an active and willing participant who made her own choices about her relationship. The author didn't ""break up"" the relationship single-handedly - Sarah chose to end it, and there were pre-existing problems.

This appears to be a case where multiple people made questionable decisions that contributed to the outcome.

The author acknowledges that his fiancée has valid reasons for not wanting to take his name (it sounds awkward with her first name) and that she's offering what she sees as reasonable compromises (hyphenation or adding her initial). She's also being consistent - if she's keeping her name, she wants the children to share her name too, which is logical.

The author, however, admits to being completely inflexible on this issue. He states he doesn't want to compromise ""at all"" and will only accept option (a) - his last name as is - rejecting any alternative. His reasoning is based on tradition and what he ""grew up knowing"" would happen, but he's not engaging with his partner's legitimate concerns or proposed solutions.

While both people are entitled to their preferences about names, the author's complete unwillingness to consider any compromise in what should be a partnership decision, combined with his acknowledgment that he's being stubborn, suggests he's not approaching this fairly. His fiancée is at least trying to find middle ground that addresses both of their concerns.

The author seems to recognize this might make him the asshole, and his rigid stance on something that affects both partners equally does appear unreasonable.

The neighbors have young children (ages 2-5 based on the author's estimate), and crying is completely normal developmental behavior for kids this age. Toddlers and preschoolers cry frequently - it's how they communicate distress, frustration, tiredness, etc. The author even acknowledges this sounds like normal kid whining rather than distress crying. Parents can't realistically prevent all crying, and attempting to ""stifle"" every episode would likely be counterproductive or even harmful to child development.

On the other hand, the author and roommate are responding by yelling through the walls with comments like ""Hey kid how bout you shut up?"" and ""Come on kid again want me to come over?"" in what they describe as a ""mockingly intense tone."" Even if they frame this as ""mostly having fun,"" this behavior is:

1. Inappropriate - yelling at neighbors' children through walls
2. Potentially intimidating to the family
3. Unhelpful in addressing the situation
4. Could escalate tensions unnecessarily

The author hasn't attempted any constructive communication with the neighbors about the noise issue. While they mention not wanting to leave passive-aggressive notes, there are mature ways to address noise concerns between neighbors.

The neighbors are dealing with normal child behavior, while the author and roommate are choosing an immature and potentially hostile response.

This information was then spread to many people, causing significant harm to the ex-girlfriend's reputation and life while not affecting the author.

The author bears primary responsibility here for several reasons:
1. They chose to disclose private, intimate information about their ex-girlfriend without her consent
2. They shared this information with someone they knew was a mutual friend, making it predictable that it could spread
3. They acknowledge being ""a dumbass"" for doing this, showing awareness it was wrong
4. The consequences were severe for the ex-girlfriend but didn't affect the author, suggesting a gendered double standard in how this information was received

While the mutual friend also acted wrongly by spreading the information, the author initiated this chain of events by choosing to share private details in the first place. The author had a responsibility to protect their ex-girlfriend's privacy, especially regarding intimate matters.

The author describes years of problematic behavior from the stepchildren, including theft, property damage, endangering a toddler, and using the father figure as an ""ATM."" The author has tried to maintain a relationship but has now drawn boundaries to protect their child and household.

While the stepchildren are dealing with their own family dysfunction and may be acting out due to trauma, their behavior as described (especially endangering a toddler and stealing) crosses serious lines. The author's decision to protect their child and set boundaries appears reasonable given the pattern of escalating problematic behavior.

The fiancé seems caught between his emotional attachment to children he helped raise and the reality of their current behavior. His scaling back of contact suggests he recognizes the issues too.

The author isn't demanding the fiancé cut contact entirely - they're setting boundaries for themselves and their child while allowing the fiancé to make his own choices about maintaining contact.

The author's reaction is understandable - there's a significant difference between nosebleed stains and menstrual blood stains from an ex-partner in terms of intimacy and hygiene concerns. Her initial acceptance when told it was nosebleeds, followed by discomfort upon learning the true source, is a reasonable response that many people would share.

However, the boyfriend's behavior is more problematic. He initially lied about the source of the stains, claiming they were from nosebleeds when they were actually from his ex's period. This deception is concerning. Additionally, keeping sheets with large blood stains from an ex-partner for 8+ months while dating someone new shows poor judgment and insensitivity.

While the author could have handled her demand to throw away the sheets more diplomatically, her core concern about sleeping on bedding stained with an ex's bodily fluids is legitimate. The boyfriend's accusation that she's being jealous rather than acknowledging his deception and poor hygiene practices deflects from his own responsibility.

The boyfriend's initial lie and failure to replace obviously stained bedding before having a new partner sleep over makes him primarily at fault, though the author's demanding approach could have been more tactful.

The author has a documented history of being late that has repeatedly upset his girlfriend. However, in this instance, he was actually on time and available as planned. His girlfriend initially changed her arrival time to accommodate hanging out with a male coworker, then became significantly later than even that revised time.

The key issues here are:
1. The girlfriend's apparent double standard - being very upset when the author is late but then being late herself
2. Her acknowledgment that she would be ""furious"" if he hung out with another woman, yet doing exactly that herself
3. Her choice to prioritize staying with the coworker over being punctual with her boyfriend

While the author expresses some jealousy about the male friend, he handles it maturely by acknowledging these are his feelings to manage and that she has the right to friendships. His primary frustration seems to be about the lateness and perceived double standard rather than controlling behavior.

The girlfriend appears to have different standards for herself versus her partner, which creates an unfair dynamic in the relationship.

The fiancée's behavior shows several concerning patterns:
- Breaking up with him for someone she met on a cruise, then getting back together
- Dismissive attitude toward his mental health struggles (""suck it up"" regarding nightmares)
- Pressuring him about jobs while hiding that she lost her own job
- Taking his limited money for granted and complaining about restaurant choices
- Refusing to communicate effectively or make any effort to improve the relationship

The author made a significant decision to bring a firearm into a shared living space without informing their roommate.

Most reasonable people would expect to be informed about something like this, regardless of their personal views on guns.

However, the roommate's response was quite extreme. Calling the author a ""gun nut and psycho"" to mutual friends and issuing an ultimatum (get rid of the gun or move out) seems disproportionate, especially given that the gun is stored safely and responsibly. This kind of name-calling and social campaign appears vindictive.

The author should have communicated about this decision upfront, as it affects the shared living space. The roommate, while understandably upset about not being told, responded in a way that was unnecessarily harsh and damaging to their relationship and the author's reputation.

However, the restaurant staff (including the manager who came over but ignored the issue) and the husband are both failing to take appropriate action. The restaurant has a duty to maintain safe, sanitary conditions for customers. The husband is being dismissive of a valid concern, likely due to his friendship with an employee there.

The boyfriend's response was disproportionate and unhelpful. Instead of discussing the request or offering alternatives, he shouted, refused to consider any changes, and essentially blamed the author for the entire problem.

The author was genuinely struggling to concentrate due to a strong odor, which is understandable.

There were more tactful alternatives available, such as:
- Moving to a different seat
- Speaking to the person privately
- Asking staff to address the situation discreetly

The fact that other people in the room reacted negatively (""looked a bit weird"") suggests this approach crossed social boundaries. While the author's frustration was valid, the public nature of the request likely caused unnecessary embarrassment to the other person.

The other person may have been unaware of the issue, and body odor can result from various factors including medical conditions, personal circumstances, or cultural differences. However, in a shared public space, there is some responsibility to maintain basic hygiene standards.

The author acknowledges they deliberately prevent other drivers from merging, even when it's safe to do so, based on a sense of territorial ownership of road space and queue position. While they make exceptions for safety-critical situations like highway on-ramps, their general approach is to block mergers out of principle.

The author does raise a valid point about drivers who abuse merge lanes or cut in line unfairly. However, their blanket policy of not allowing merges goes beyond just preventing queue-jumpers - it affects all drivers trying to merge, including those with legitimate needs.

Safe driving practices generally encourage allowing merges when possible, as blocking them can create dangerous situations, increase road rage incidents, and worsen traffic flow. The author's territorial attitude (""why should someone who's spent less time on a road than me be entitled to merge in front of me?"") suggests this is more about personal pride than traffic safety or fairness.

She's exhausted, nauseous, dizzy, and struggling with basic daily activities. Despite this, she's still trying to be accommodating by suggesting ""maybe"" to sex and offering alternatives like cuddling.

The boyfriend, while taking on household responsibilities and caregiving duties (which is commendable), is displaying problematic behavior around consent and boundaries. Most critically, after being told ""not really"" when asked about sex, he later attempted to physically initiate by trying to pull down her pants without permission. This crosses a clear boundary and shows disregard for her explicit ""no.""

Additionally, his pattern of repeatedly asking for sex despite her condition, and asking ""how she feels"" with the sole intention of getting sex, shows a concerning lack of respect for her current health crisis and her clearly communicated boundaries.

The aunt initiated and maintained this pattern of public shaming and judgment. The family's immediate rallying against the author suggests this is indeed a ""hive minded"" dynamic where the author faces systemic rejection for being different.

The author experienced secondhand embarrassment during their friends' choir performance and physically reacted by slinking down and covering their face. While this reaction was involuntary and based on their own sensitivity to musical mistakes, it was visible enough that others noticed and commented on it.

The key issue here is that the author's visible reaction of embarrassment could have been seen by the performers and would likely have been hurtful and discouraging to them. Even though the performance may not have been technically perfect, the performers were putting themselves out there and being vulnerable. A supportive friend would typically try to be encouraging or at least maintain a neutral expression, even if the performance wasn't great.

The author's friend pointed out that this reaction could hurt the performers, which suggests it was noticeable enough to potentially undermine their confidence. While the author's feelings of secondhand embarrassment are understandable given their own sensitivity about singing, allowing those feelings to manifest in such a visible way during their friends' performance shows a lack of consideration for the performers' feelings.

I’ve s...",Author,Everybody,0.72,0.3333333333333333,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the dynamics between both partners and their respective responsibilities.

The husband has made some positive changes (improving his temper control) but has consistently failed to follow through on a specific commitment that holds symbolic importance for their relationship - the shelves they were supposed to hang together as part of rebuilding after his destructive outburst. His pattern of readily helping others while neglecting commitments to his wife shows a concerning prioritization issue.

However, the wife's communication approach also has problems. She admits to spending 6 months to a year ""trying to get him to understand"" through indirect methods rather than direct communication. When she finally had an opportunity for clear dialogue (the car conversation), she failed to specifically mention the shelves despite them being ""definitely on my mind."" Her expectation that he should read between the lines and understand her indirect references isn't entirely fair.

The husband's acknowledgment that he understands why his behavior would be hurtful, followed by asking for specifics, suggests he may genuinely want to address the issues but needs clearer communication. The wife's assumption that he was ""purposefully blowing me off"" when he asked for clarification seems to reflect a pattern of negative interpretation.

Both parties are contributing to the communication breakdown - he through lack of follow-through and emotional awareness, she through indirect communication and assumptions about his intentions.

The friend appears to have deliberately tried to provoke the author by immediately criticizing the Lakers right after they won, knowing the author is a huge fan. The timing (before the author could even finish celebrating) and the fact that she also likes the team suggests this was intentionally antagonistic behavior.

However, the author's response of screaming at their friend to get out was disproportionate to the provocation. While the friend's behavior was annoying and deliberately provocative, it was relatively minor - just some trash talk about a sports team. The author escalated this into a much more serious confrontation by screaming and kicking their friend out.

Both people contributed to this conflict - the friend through deliberate antagonism and the author through an excessive reaction. Neither person handled the situation well.

So now we are both in college together and ...",Author,Nobody,0.72,0.7,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives and actions of both people involved.

The author has legitimate concerns about prom - the cost, the requirement to dress up, and their past negative experience with homecoming at the same school. They're also no longer students there, which adds to the awkwardness. Their preference for alternative activities like a beach walk shows they want to spend time with their girlfriend, just not at prom.

However, the author seems to be dismissing something that's clearly important to their girlfriend. Prom is often seen as a significant milestone, and she may have emotional reasons for wanting to attend that go beyond the author's practical concerns. The author appears to be trying to convince her not to go rather than finding a compromise or simply supporting her desire to attend.

The girlfriend wants to go to prom despite the bad homecoming experience, which suggests it holds special meaning for her. She's not necessarily being unreasonable in wanting this experience.

This seems like a situation where both people have valid but conflicting preferences, and the main issue is a lack of compromise or understanding rather than anyone being clearly in the wrong.

Well yesterday we had one of those arguments a...",Author,Everybody,0.72,0.5769230769230769,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the sexual consent and communication issues at play.

The girlfriend initially couldn't reach climax despite extended foreplay, became frustrated, and decided to stop - which is her absolute right. However, she then expressed this decision with attitude and in a way that left her partner feeling confused and rejected after what seemed like mutual buildup.

The author's response of saying ""are you serious, are you really going to tease me and then just go to bed"" was problematic because it frames her decision to stop as ""teasing"" rather than respecting her bodily autonomy. No one owes sex to anyone, regardless of how aroused either party becomes.

However, the girlfriend then re-initiated, but when asked if it was ""pity sex,"" she confirmed it was. This creates a problematic dynamic where she's engaging in sexual activity she doesn't genuinely want, which isn't healthy for either partner.

The author's decision to stop when he realized it was pity sex was actually the right call - continuing would have been problematic for both parties.

Both parties handled this poorly: the girlfriend by giving attitude when stopping (though stopping itself was fine) and then engaging in unwanted ""pity sex,"" and the author by initially pressuring her and framing her boundary-setting as ""teasing.""

This seems like a communication breakdown where both people made mistakes in how they handled sexual boundaries and frustration.

The author admits to being ""so much attached"" that they spend all day waiting for their girlfriend to return from work. When she comes home tired from her job and doesn't immediately text extensively, they get upset. Their girlfriend works 9-hour days (7am-4pm, sometimes until 6pm) as a cashier - a physically and mentally draining job - yet the author expects constant communication and gets ""sad and mad"" when she takes time to rest.

When the girlfriend tried to de-escalate with heart and kiss emojis, the author found this ""very annoying."" They asked for space, which was reasonable, but when the girlfriend continued trying to communicate (albeit imperfectly), the author's response was to block her entirely.

The girlfriend's responses weren't perfect - the sarcasm and ""blah blah blah"" comment show she was also frustrated. However, her core point that she was tired from work and still made effort to communicate seems valid.

The author shows some self-awareness by questioning if they're overreacting and planning to reach out the next morning, but blocking someone during a minor disagreement is a disproportionate response that shuts down healthy conflict resolution.

The author clearly stated they paid the $200 ""with no expectations that she would pay me back. It was a straight up gift on my part."" This was a deliberate choice made at the time, not a loan or conditional payment. The SIL's financial situation at the time of the gift doesn't retroactively change the nature of that transaction.

While I understand the author's feelings - it can sting to see someone receive a windfall when you helped them during their financial constraints - asking for the money back would essentially be trying to convert a past gift into a loan after the fact. This violates the implicit agreement and trust that was established when the gift was made.

The author is also benefiting significantly from this cat's presence (it ""sleeps in our bed"" and spends ""90% of its time"" at their house), so they weren't acting purely altruistically.

The SIL, while not a great pet owner, did take the cat to the vet when asked and has been caring for it within her means. The inheritance doesn't create any moral obligation to repay gifts she received in the past.

We don't really ...",Author,Author,0.75,0.8085106382978723,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the appropriateness of making a ""hookup pact"" while in a committed relationship.

The author made an agreement with someone to hook up if either becomes single in the future. While they framed it as harmless since both are currently in relationships, this crosses several boundaries:

1. It demonstrates a lack of commitment to their current relationship by already planning for its potential end
2. It's disrespectful to their girlfriend, who likely wouldn't appreciate her partner making such arrangements
3. It maintains an inappropriate level of romantic/sexual connection with someone outside the relationship
4. The fact that they're asking if they're being an asshole suggests they already sense this was wrong

The author seems genuinely confused about whether this was inappropriate, which suggests inexperience rather than malicious intent (they mention this is their first relationship). However, good intentions don't excuse the boundary violation.

The friend who called this out was right to point out the problematic nature of this pact. The other person (C) also participated in making this agreement, but the author is the one seeking judgment here.

This appears to be a case where the author made a poor decision that violates relationship boundaries, even if unintentionally.

The author has been listening to their boyfriend go in circles about a major life decision for weeks. They offered constructive advice (making a pros and cons list) and even offered to help create it together. The boyfriend continues the same pattern of calling with each new thought, changing his mind based on the most recent factor, without taking steps to organize his thinking process.

The author's frustration is understandable - they're being used as a sounding board for circular thinking rather than productive problem-solving. Their ultimatum (""stop talking to me about it if you're not going to follow my advice"") comes after weeks of patient listening and offering practical solutions.

While the delivery could have been more diplomatic, the author isn't being unreasonable. They've been supportive, offered concrete help, and are setting a boundary when their advice is repeatedly ignored. The boyfriend's pattern of obsessive circular thinking without taking constructive action is the main issue here.

The author could have communicated their frustration more gently, but their core position - wanting their partner to take productive steps rather than just venting in circles - is fair and reasonable.

She was very nice, very sweet (Italian) and she was always friendly...",Everybody,Everybody,0.72,0.375,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to evaluate the actions and responses of both parties.

The author clearly made a significant error in judgment by:
- Impersonating a faculty member via email (which violates university IT policy)
- Creating a prank that could reasonably cause distress to someone already stressed about their dissertation
- Not immediately confessing when the prank didn't go as planned
- Underestimating how this could be perceived as harassment

However, Ani's response seems disproportionate:
- She reported this to the ""ENTIRE department"" rather than first confronting her friend directly
- She pushed for the most severe punishment possible (expulsion) for what was clearly intended as a harmless prank between friends
- She completely cut off all contact and demanded no future interaction
- Her reaction seems to lack consideration for their long friendship and the author's clear lack of malicious intent

The university investigation concluded this was a first offense with no pattern of harassment, and the department head even briefly smiled at the meme, suggesting the content itself wasn't particularly offensive.

While the author was wrong to impersonate faculty and should face consequences, Ani's nuclear response - trying to get her friend expelled and destroying their relationship - seems excessive given the context of their friendship and the author's obvious remorse and willingness to accept responsibility.

Both parties bear some responsibility, but Ani's disproportionate escalation makes this a case where everyone contributed to the conflict.

The author received poor service - having to ask for basic items like water and soy sauce, with the waiter only bringing the food. A $2 tip on a $40 meal (5%) reflects this poor service experience. The author also took the time to explain their reasoning when confronted.

However, the waiter's response was highly unprofessional. Confronting a customer about their tip amount, calling them a ""lousy person,"" and making a scene crosses clear professional boundaries, regardless of disappointment with the tip.

While tipping customs vary and some might argue the tip was too low even for poor service, the waiter's aggressive and insulting behavior was inappropriate and escalated the situation unnecessarily. The author's response appears measured in comparison.

The waiter's unprofessional conduct is the primary issue here, making them primarily at fault for how this situation unfolded.

The author is being generous by cooking breakfast for their roommate every morning, which is genuinely kind. However, the roommate has clearly indicated through their actions that they don't like parsley - they've been consistently removing it and hiding it rather than eating it. This is actually a pretty clear non-verbal communication that they don't enjoy this ingredient.

The concerning part is the author's response. Instead of having a simple conversation about food preferences or just asking ""Hey, do you like the parsley?"" they've decided to deliberately add MORE of something their roommate obviously dislikes. This feels passive-aggressive and punitive rather than considerate.

The roommate could have been more direct about their preferences, but many people try to be polite about food they're receiving for free, especially when someone is being generous with their time and effort. Hiding the parsley rather than complaining shows they were trying not to hurt the author's feelings while still not eating something they dislike.

The author's plan to increase the parsley specifically because they noticed it being avoided crosses the line from generous cooking into deliberately making the food less enjoyable for the recipient.

The author is upset about having to potentially entertain a 13-year-old when they wanted to play a newly released video game. While it's understandable to be disappointed about changed plans, getting ""pissed off"" about a child coming to a family dinner seems like an overreaction. The assumption that they'll definitely have to entertain the kid all evening may not even be accurate - the 13-year-old might be fine doing their own thing or could even be interested in watching/playing games too.

The parents made dinner plans and accommodated their friends bringing their son when childcare plans changed. This is normal social flexibility. The dad's reaction to the author's anger seems proportionate - he's trying to reassure them it will be fine.

The visiting family is just adapting to their daughter being out and bringing their son instead. This is reasonable.

The customer has:
- Persistently asked the author out despite rejections
- Continued flirting after being turned down
- Escalated to attempting physical contact (trying to kiss her) without consent
- Laughed when she clearly said ""no"" and pulled away
- Pursued her more aggressively after she said she was a lesbian

The author has:
- Tried to politely reject his advances multiple times
- Lied about being a lesbian out of panic (which she acknowledges was wrong)
- Is now considering being more direct/cold in her rejections
- Is concerned about workplace consequences

While the author made a mistake by lying about her sexuality, this was clearly a panic response to persistent unwanted advances. Her lie doesn't justify or excuse the customer's escalating inappropriate behavior, especially his attempt to kiss her without consent after months of rejections.

The customer is demonstrating classic predatory behavior - ignoring clear rejections, escalating physical advances, and treating her ""no"" as something to laugh at. The author is simply trying to protect herself from harassment while navigating workplace constraints.

The customer's behavior is the primary problem here, and the author's response (including considering being more direct) is reasonable self-protection.

The author is clearly frustrated with their limited sexual frequency and his girlfriend's pregnancy anxiety, which is understandable. However, his approach to addressing these issues is problematic. He dismisses his girlfriend's legitimate concerns about pregnancy (even with protection, no method is 100% effective), shows impatience with her religious/cultural background that shapes her views on sex, and his tone suggests he prioritizes his sexual needs over her comfort and boundaries.

The girlfriend also bears some responsibility - she's in a sexual relationship but hasn't taken steps to address her anxiety through education, birth control consultation, or honest communication about her comfort levels. Her pattern of initiating only when he's not asking creates mixed signals.

However, the core issue seems to be the author's approach. Rather than having compassionate conversations about their sexual compatibility, seeking couples counseling, or considering whether they're truly compatible long-term, he's planning to manipulate the situation by withdrawing and hoping she'll ""sexually blossom"" later. This passive-aggressive strategy doesn't address the underlying issues and puts the burden entirely on her to change.

The girlfriend's concerns and boundaries, while perhaps anxiety-driven, are valid given her background and beliefs. The author's dismissive attitude toward these concerns is the primary problem here.

The author's position has some merit - she wants time with her established friend group, and it's reasonable to want some activities separate from one's romantic partner. She also points out that her boyfriend had his own trip that she didn't ask to join.

However, the boyfriend's concerns are also understandable. From his perspective, his girlfriend is going on a trip that includes her ex (even though they're now just friends), and when he expresses interest in joining, she immediately shuts it down. His feelings about being excluded while her ex is included are valid, especially since he's made an effort to get along with the ex in previous group settings.

The author's reasoning feels somewhat weak - saying ""these are my friends"" and ""he doesn't even know those friends"" suggests she's not interested in integrating him into her social circle or helping him get to know her friends better. The comparison to his gaming convention isn't quite equivalent since that didn't involve her ex.

While everyone deserves friend time, the author's immediate ""no"" without much consideration for her boyfriend's feelings, combined with the ex being present, creates an understandably uncomfortable dynamic for the boyfriend.

The brother and wife's response - yelling for an hour, name-calling (""useless, drug addicted asshole""), and publicly shaming on social media - is completely disproportionate and inappropriate. Their poor planning doesn't create an obligation for others to make massive sacrifices.

However, the author also admits to deliberately ignoring production assistants even when they could potentially find alternative routes, particularly when running late for class.

While I understand the frustration with commercial productions disrupting public spaces, the author's approach of consistently ignoring requests from production staff and walking through active sets shows a disregard for both safety protocols and reasonable accommodation attempts. The fact that they acknowledge hearing the requests but choosing to ignore them with headphones suggests intentional non-cooperation.

The production crews also bear some responsibility for inadequate communication and potentially blocking essential access routes without proper notice or alternatives.

The author describes being attracted to people with mental health issues for two reasons: relatability (sharing similar experiences) and enjoying helping others. While the helping aspect could potentially be concerning if it involves a ""savior complex,"" the author seems to have some self-awareness about this pattern and is genuinely questioning whether it's problematic.

The friend's reaction - giving a ""scathing speech,"" calling the author a ""terrible person and villain,"" and then blocking them when they tried to explain - seems extremely harsh for someone sharing a personal realization and asking for perspective. The author wasn't describing actively pursuing or manipulating vulnerable people, but rather recognizing an attraction pattern and questioning its ethics.

The author shows self-reflection by acknowledging they sometimes sacrifice their own mental health to help others and by feeling ashamed after the friend's reaction. They're genuinely asking whether their behavior is wrong, which suggests they're open to changing if needed.

The author has been walking with an attractive female best friend (whom he used to have a crush on) for nearly a year, including having drinks together when either feels down. He's now in a relationship with someone he describes as ""very jealous"" but hasn't told his girlfriend about these regular walks because he doesn't think she'd approve. Additionally, he suspects his girlfriend may be in love with another woman.

The core issue here is the author's decision to hide his ongoing close friendship from his girlfriend. While having platonic friendships is normal and healthy, deliberately concealing regular one-on-one activities with someone you previously had romantic feelings for creates a problematic dynamic. This secrecy, combined with his acknowledgment that his girlfriend wouldn't approve, suggests he knows this behavior could be hurtful to his relationship.

However, the girlfriend's suspected feelings for another woman and her described jealous nature also contribute to the dysfunction in this relationship. The overall situation suggests poor communication and potential incompatibility between the partners.

The author's position is entirely reasonable:
1. They acknowledge mental health conditions can affect behavior
2. They don't believe mental illness excuses abuse
3. They're willing to accept she's getting treatment but don't see why that obligates them to forgive
4. They're not preventing her recovery - just maintaining boundaries

Mental health conditions may explain behavior but don't excuse abuse or obligate victims to forgive. The author has every right to protect their wellbeing and refuse contact with someone who severely harmed them, especially when that person hasn't genuinely apologized or taken accountability.

The ex-girlfriend and her supporters are at fault for trying to manipulate the author into accepting abuse under the guise of mental health advocacy.

The author and their friends are approaching strangers under false pretenses - pretending to be genuinely interested in getting to know someone when they actually have no intention of following through. They're collecting phone numbers as part of a ""game"" with no real interest in the people they're approaching.

While the author shows some self-awareness by recognizing potential problems with their behavior, they continue to engage in it because they find it ""fun."" The key issues are:

1) They're being deceptive about their intentions
2) They're treating other people as objects for their entertainment/confidence building
3) They're wasting people's time and potentially creating false hope
4) They recognize it might make others uncomfortable but continue anyway

The strangers being approached aren't at fault - they're just going about their lives and responding to what they believe are genuine social interactions.

While the behavior isn't necessarily ""sexual harassment"" in a legal sense, it is inconsiderate and manipulative. The author recognizes the ethical problems but continues the behavior, which makes them responsible for the choice to prioritize their own entertainment over treating others with basic respect.

A bunch of...,Author,Author,0.72,0.5714285714285714,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to evaluate whether the author is being unreasonable in wanting to get a dog despite others' concerns.

The author presents several positive factors: they have in-laws with a house and garden where the dog could stay during work hours, their partner can work from home 80% of the time, and they've been wanting this for a long time. These suggest they've thought about practical arrangements.

However, the author's approach is concerning. They're dismissing all advice without engaging with the specific reasons people are giving them. The aggressive tone (""fuck you motherfucker"") and refusal to consider that others might have valid concerns suggests they're not approaching this decision maturely. Getting a pet is a major responsibility that affects not just the owner but their partner, family, and the animal itself.

The fact that ""everyone"" they've talked to says it's not the right time suggests there may be legitimate concerns they're not addressing or sharing in this post. While peer pressure isn't always right, when multiple people consistently give the same advice, it's worth seriously considering their reasoning rather than dismissing it outright.

The author seems to be making this decision based primarily on their emotional needs (""I'm burnt out and need a dog"") rather than what's best for the animal or their household situation.

The author is having negative feelings about their brother and father coming to their grandfather's birthday celebration. However, they explicitly state they haven't expressed these feelings to their grandfather and wouldn't suggest he not invite the people he wants to spend his birthday with. They're simply questioning whether their internal feelings are justified.

Having feelings - even negative ones - about social situations when you're stressed, tired, and overwhelmed is completely normal and human. The author is dealing with college stress and exhaustion, which naturally makes social interactions feel more draining. What matters morally is how we act on those feelings, not the feelings themselves.

The author is handling this appropriately by:
- Not interfering with their grandfather's birthday plans
- Not expressing their negative feelings in a way that would hurt others
- Simply seeking validation for having normal human emotions during a difficult time

They're not trying to exclude anyone or ruin the celebration - they're just internally struggling with their own capacity for social interaction while stressed.

The author discovered what they believed to be a pornographic video of a coworker and made the decision to share this information with a friend from work. This was a clear violation of the coworker's privacy and dignity. Even if the video was publicly available online, sharing it within their workplace created a harmful situation that directly led to the woman's distress and humiliation at work.

The friend who received this information also bears responsibility for continuing to spread it rather than keeping the information private or advising against sharing it further.

However, the primary fault lies with the author who initiated this chain of events by making the decision to share intimate content of a coworker in the first place. This was a serious breach of basic respect and workplace boundaries that caused significant emotional harm to another person.

The coworker who appeared in the video is not at fault - whatever personal choices someone makes regarding their private life or intimate content does not justify workplace harassment or humiliation.

The author appears to be handling a difficult situation with consideration and maturity. They recognize their partner has a phobia, don't pressure her, and are trying to protect both her comfort and their own sexual experience by declining when the situation isn't conducive to enjoyment for either party. They're also concerned about not making their partner feel inadequate.

The partner, while dealing with a legitimate phobia, seems to be creating additional conflict by getting ""really offended"" when the author declines, and making guilt-inducing comments about how ""a lot of girls wouldn't do it for their BFs."" This response shows a lack of understanding of why the author is declining and creates pressure in an already sensitive situation.

However, this appears to be more of a communication breakdown and incompatibility issue rather than anyone being truly ""at fault."" Both people have legitimate needs and limitations - the partner has a phobia they can't control, and the author has reasonable boundaries about what kind of sexual experience works for them.

The core issue seems to be that they haven't found a way to communicate effectively about this sensitive topic, leading to hurt feelings and misunderstandings on both sides.

The author made several significant mistakes:
- Had unprotected sex with someone he just met while heavily intoxicated
- Continued a casual relationship while being clear about not wanting commitment
- Ended things abruptly when he decided to pursue someone else

However, he also took some responsible actions:
- Immediately got a morning-after pill the next day
- Used protection in all subsequent encounters
- Was upfront about not wanting a relationship
- Provided mental health resources when she expressed suicidal thoughts
- Acknowledged his mistakes and apologized

The other person also bears responsibility:
- Equally participated in unprotected sex with someone she just met
- Agreed to a casual arrangement while claiming not to want a relationship
- Used emotional manipulation (suicide threats) when things ended
- Continued to contact him despite his clear boundaries
- Is now blaming him entirely for a situation they both created

While the author's initial decision was reckless and he handled the ending somewhat callously, both adults made the choice to have unprotected sex. The pregnancy (if real) was an unfortunate consequence of a mutual decision. His subsequent behavior, while not perfect, shows he tried to be responsible within the boundaries he had established.

The other person's continued harassment and attempts to make him solely responsible for their mutual choices crosses into inappropriate territory.

The parents clearly made significant harmful decisions:
- Became controlling and emotionally absent after their tragic loss
- Provided inadequate homeschooling with rigid ideological indoctrination
- Failed to properly address their child's mental health needs
- Created an environment so toxic it contributed to suicidal ideation

However, the author is contemplating complete permanent estrangement, which is an extreme step that would cause significant pain to the parents. While the author has legitimate grievances and the right to protect their mental health, completely cutting off all contact without any attempt at setting boundaries or seeking family therapy represents a very harsh approach.

The parents' failures stem partly from their own unprocessed grief and likely mental health issues following their infant's death. This doesn't excuse their harmful parenting, but provides important context.

The author has worked with counselors and trusted people, showing they're approaching this thoughtfully rather than impulsively.

Given the severity of the harm caused by the parents' actions and the author's documented mental health struggles directly linked to their upbringing, along with professional support for this decision, I believe the author's right to self-preservation outweighs other considerations here.

The author is being dishonest about his intentions and feelings. He admits he doesn't see this woman as his ""future soulmate"" but wants to keep her around while pursuing other women.

Key problematic elements:
- He wants to ""keep this girl"" while pursuing others, which is inherently deceptive
- He's aware she's deeply invested (""really into me"") but plans to mislead her about his level of commitment
- He's considering staying in the relationship primarily to avoid hurting her feelings in the short term, which will likely cause much greater harm later
- He admits he feels like he might cheat if he continues this path

While the woman's intense attachment early on might have been concerning, she's been honest about her feelings throughout. The author, however, is planning deliberate deception.

The author initiated the harassment by making inappropriate comments about M's sexuality, knowing M couldn't verbally respond due to being silenced by the teacher. This was deliberately provocative behavior. However, M's response was disproportionate - he escalated from physical actions (flicking, gripping neck, pushing) to writing deeply hurtful personal attacks targeting the author's known insecurities about self-worth and relationships.

When the author retaliated by mentioning M's girlfriend potentially breaking up with him, this triggered an even more extreme reaction with screaming. While the author did attempt to de-escalate by suggesting a truce, the damage from the mutual harassment had already been done.

Both students engaged in inappropriate behavior - the author started the conflict with harassment, and M escalated it significantly with both physical actions and cruel personal attacks. Neither party handled the situation maturely, and both contributed to creating a hostile classroom environment.

The author's concerns appear to be based on observable behaviors rather than unfounded jealousy or controlling tendencies.

The girlfriend seems to be either unaware of how her actions affect her partner or dismissive of legitimate relationship concerns. Having one ex-hookup as a close friend might be manageable, but the pattern described here would reasonably cause concern for most people in committed relationships.

When confronted, she became defensive and made threats rather than addressing the legitimate concerns about dishonesty.

The author violated privacy and trust by snooping, but they were responding to what appears to be genuine deception about the girlfriend's availability and honesty in the relationship.

The author recognizes these are reasonable requests but continues the behavior due to being busy with doctoral studies.

The author made a thoughtful Facebook post with a collage for their twin sister's birthday, which shows genuine effort and care.

The late-night timing and accusatory tone (""So like you never wished me happy birthday... what's that all about?"") came across as picking a fight rather than expressing hurt feelings constructively.

The sister's responses, while defensive, show she was caught off-guard by this late-night confrontation. Her point about it being ""unfair"" to bring up hurt feelings a week later has merit - if this was truly bothering the author, it should have been addressed much sooner and in a more appropriate manner.

However, the author's approach of simply asking them to ""finish up or stop"" after a set time period might also lack nuance - perhaps not considering if the partner is in the middle of something important in their game or not discussing mutually agreed-upon boundaries beforehand.

D is risking not just his own job opportunity, but potentially M's professional reputation and income by continuing to smoke while knowing he needs to pass a drug test. M is going out on a limb professionally to help family, and D's actions show a concerning disregard for that risk. The fact that D has a pregnant partner (P) who depends on him makes his behavior even more problematic.

However, telling C would essentially be tattling on family members and could create significant family drama. The author would be inserting themselves into a situation that doesn't directly involve them, potentially breaking trust and causing rifts in family relationships.

That said, M deserves to know that his professional reputation and livelihood could be at risk before he makes this recommendation. He's the one who will face consequences if D fails the test, and he should be able to make an informed decision about whether to proceed.

While the author's motivations might be good (protecting M), going behind D's back creates its own ethical issues. The more appropriate approach would be to talk to D directly first, or encourage P to address this with her fiancé.

- He got angry when she said no, feeling entitled to a yes because they ""looked like a couple""
- He's upset about her avoiding him after he asked her out, but this is a reasonable response when someone needs space after rejecting a romantic advance
- His communication was passive-aggressive and unclear

The girl's behavior seems reasonable:
- She was uncomfortable when people assumed they were dating and communicated this
- She gave a polite rejection when asked out
- She's been avoiding him, which is understandable after rejecting someone and needing space
- Her defensive response about ""cutting him off"" suggests she may not have been intentionally avoiding him as much as he perceives

The author is primarily at fault for misreading the situation, feeling entitled to reciprocated feelings, and being angry about natural consequences of his romantic pursuit of a friend who wasn't interested.

The author and suitemate:
- Took significant personal risk by allowing M to live in their dorm illegally
- Provided free housing with minimal expectations
- Set one clear, reasonable boundary: don't get back together with the ex who kicked her out
- Gave M multiple chances after she violated their trust
- Were lied to repeatedly about M's whereabouts and activities
- Finally enforced their boundary after being deceived multiple times

M's actions:
- Only contacted friends when she needed something
- Repeatedly lied about her activities and whereabouts
- Violated the one clear condition for staying
- Took advantage of her friends' generosity while disrespecting their boundaries
- Put her friends at risk of academic consequences

The boundary set by the author and suitemate was reasonable - they weren't trying to control M's life generally, but rather protecting themselves from being used as a revolving door solution to an unstable relationship. M's pattern of behavior shows she was using their kindness without respecting their very minimal requirements.

While the final text could have been more diplomatic, the authors had already tried gentle approaches multiple times and been repeatedly deceived. Their frustration was understandable given the circumstances.

We'd say grace...,Other,Nobody,0.72,0.9230769230769231,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the competing values and perspectives at play.

The author has legitimate moral objections to attending Catholic mass based on well-reasoned concerns about institutional issues and treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals. At 21, they're an adult capable of making their own religious decisions. They're not trying to stop their parents from attending or being disrespectful about their parents' beliefs - they simply want to opt out themselves.

The parents, while understandably wanting family unity during holidays, are creating conflict by pressuring their adult child to participate in religious practices against their conscience. The pattern of ""large fights"" suggests they're not respecting their child's autonomy or attempting to find compromise solutions.

However, this appears to be more about different values and life stages rather than anyone being truly ""at fault."" The parents likely see this as important family tradition and togetherness, while the author sees it as a matter of personal integrity. Both positions are understandable, even if the execution could be better on both sides.

The author is trying to stand up for their principles while still being respectful of their parents' right to practice their faith. The parents are struggling to accept their child's different path. This seems like a natural family growing pain rather than anyone being particularly wrong.

The author asked their friend to split the $100 referral bonus 50/50 or take them out to dinner twice. While this request isn't inherently unreasonable - the friend wouldn't get the bonus without the referral - the friend has every right to decline. Referral programs are designed as incentives for existing customers, and there's no obligation to share those rewards.

However, the friend's response seems unnecessarily harsh. Simply saying ""no, those are my money/points and I don't want to share them"" comes across as quite blunt, especially given their close friendship and the fact that they researched credit cards together. A more tactful response acknowledging the request while declining would have been more appropriate.

The author's follow-up argument that ""it is only fair since without me she would not be getting any points"" shows some entitlement. While technically true, this logic could apply to any business transaction or referral situation, and it's not how these programs typically work.

Both parties could have handled this better - the author by accepting the ""no"" more gracefully, and the friend by declining more diplomatically. However, the core issue stems from the author making a request that, while understandable, puts the friend in an awkward position and then pushing back when declined.

Everything was fine until the 4th nigh...,Author,Everybody,0.72,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the reasonableness of both parties' actions and expectations.

The author had a genuine phobia of insects and encountered a cockroach in their accommodation. While phobias are real and can be distressing, the requests made were quite unreasonable - asking staff to pack their luggage, demanding immediate pest control at 9 PM when stores were closed, and threatening bad reviews. These demands go well beyond what accommodation staff can reasonably be expected to provide.

However, the staff's response was also problematic. Telling a guest to ""just go if you do not like here,"" accusing them of leaving food around without evidence, and later telling them to ""be a man"" and ""not think like a kid"" was unprofessional and dismissive of a guest's concerns.

The author acknowledges that cockroaches are common in Japan during summer, which suggests some awareness that this might be an unavoidable issue. The author also showed some restraint by not leaving a bad review or causing a public scene.

Both parties handled this poorly - the author made unreasonable demands under stress, while the staff responded unprofessionally and dismissively to a guest's legitimate distress.

When the bill came, the table decided to split it evenly 5 ways without consulting the author, resulting in them paying nearly double what they actually ordered.

The author spoke up immediately upon seeing their card was charged $30 instead of $15, which was the appropriate response. The others dismissed their concern by saying they ""should have said something when the bill came,"" but the author clearly states they didn't hear this conversation about splitting the bill.

The roommates and friends are at fault here for:
1. Making a unilateral decision to split the bill without consulting everyone
2. Expecting someone who ordered significantly less to subsidize their more expensive meals and drinks
3. Dismissing the author's legitimate concern when they spoke up
4. Not being transparent about the bill-splitting decision

The author handled this reasonably - they spoke up when they noticed the discrepancy, explained their position, and while they ""pushed the issue a little more,"" they ultimately let it drop rather than escalating further. Their frustration is completely justified, especially given their financial stress.

The author made an honest mistake - he deleted what he thought were temporary images but forgot about the automatic backup feature. This is a genuine technological oversight that many people could make. He wasn't intentionally hiding anything long-term or being deceptive.

However, the girlfriend's reaction, while emotionally understandable, seems disproportionate to the actual transgression. She's declaring she ""can't trust"" him anymore over what amounts to briefly saving some images that he intended to delete (and thought he had deleted). The author is right that this feels like an overreaction - the images were from months ago, he has no connection to the person, and it was clearly not ongoing behavior.

While couples can have different boundaries around pornography, completely losing trust over accidentally retained images that were meant to be temporary seems excessive. The girlfriend also went through his Google Photos while he was in the bathroom, which raises its own questions about boundaries and trust.

The author has apologized extensively and committed to not repeating this behavior. His restraint in not telling her she's overreacting actually shows maturity and consideration for her feelings.

The author's partner made a comment that seemed to deflect responsibility for not knowing about February's shorter length, which is fairly basic knowledge. However, the author's response - questioning how a 22-year-old wouldn't know this - was unnecessarily condescending and hurtful, even if factually reasonable. The tone and delivery clearly caused emotional harm, as evidenced by the partner crying.

While the partner's initial response wasn't ideal, the author's reaction was disproportionate and mean-spirited. The author even seems to recognize this by apologizing, but then undermines it with ""but damn?"" suggesting they still think their harsh response was justified.

While it's natural to notice attractive people even in relationships, the author's dismissive attitude toward their partner's hurt feelings and their sarcastic response suggests a lack of empathy and understanding.

The author is questioning whether they should offer gas money when their coworker is already being reimbursed by the company at the standard mileage rate (which covers gas, wear and tear, and other vehicle costs). The company is essentially paying for the transportation costs already.

Key factors:
- This is a business trip with company reimbursement
- The mileage rate (50+ cents/mile) is designed to cover all vehicle expenses including gas
- The coworker volunteered to drive and will receive full compensation
- There are alternative transportation options available
- The author isn't being difficult or demanding - they're genuinely unsure about etiquette

In business contexts, when mileage is being reimbursed at standard rates, passengers typically don't pay additional gas money since the company is already covering transportation costs. The reimbursement rate is specifically calculated to make the driver whole for all vehicle-related expenses.

The author is being thoughtful by considering this question rather than just assuming, and their reasoning is sound given the business reimbursement context.

The author:
- Acknowledges their friend's boyfriend has positive qualities in the relationship
- Recognizes the couple has a healthy, supportive relationship
- Doesn't want to interfere or be unsupportive of the relationship
- Simply wants to maintain friendship while avoiding someone they find incompatible
- Has legitimate personal reasons for the discomfort (loud, overbearing behavior)

The author isn't trying to break up the couple, badmouth the boyfriend, or force their friend to choose. They're being respectful of the relationship while recognizing their own social boundaries. It's completely normal and healthy to not click with every person in your social circle.

The boyfriend doesn't appear to be doing anything objectively wrong - his personality traits (being loud, etc.) may just be incompatible with the author's preferences. The friend isn't at fault either, as there's no indication of any problematic behavior.

However IMO the kit...",Other,Everybody,0.72,0.6,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the dynamics of shared living space and reasonable expectations for both parties.

The author is frustrated that someone (likely a roommate or family member) is consistently using the kitchen as their primary workspace, which interferes with the author's ability to use the kitchen for its intended purpose - cooking and eating. The kitchen is being used for studying, group meetings, presentations, and professional video calls.

The author has legitimate concerns:
- They can't cook when hungry without disrupting someone's work
- The kitchen is being monopolized for non-kitchen activities
- There are other suitable spaces (2 living rooms) that could be used instead
- Professional calls in a kitchen seem inappropriate

However, the author's proposed solution of deliberately disrupting professional calls by ""banging pots and making oatmeal in my PJs"" is passive-aggressive and potentially harmful to the other person's professional reputation.

The other person also has some justification for wanting supervision/company while working, but they're being inconsiderate by monopolizing a shared essential space when alternatives exist.

The girlfriend has been licking ice cream container lids for years without the author's knowledge, which is understandably gross from a hygiene perspective - saliva can contaminate the remaining ice cream. However, her reasoning that ""it isn't touching"" suggests she genuinely didn't think it was problematic, indicating this wasn't done with malicious intent.

The author's reaction of getting ""pissed and grossed out"" is understandable given the hygiene violation, but the girlfriend's response calling them ""overreacting"" shows dismissiveness of legitimate concerns rather than acknowledgment or apology.

The friend is exhibiting typical new relationship excitement - constantly talking about and sharing photos of his girlfriend, even interrupting conversations to do so. While this can be annoying and socially tone-deaf, it's a common behavior when someone is infatuated.

However, the author's response of ""No one cares"" is unnecessarily harsh and dismissive. Even if the friend's behavior is excessive, there are much more tactful ways to address it, such as:
- ""Hey, I'm happy you're excited about her, but can we talk about something else for a bit?""
- ""I'd love to hear about her, but maybe we can focus on our conversation right now?""
- Having a private, honest conversation about finding a better balance

The author's blunt dismissiveness is likely hurting the friend's feelings and damaging the friendship. While the friend's behavior may be annoying, the author's response is disproportionately rude and shows a lack of empathy for their friend's happiness.

The author overheard two girls making cruel comments about their friend who had just left to use the bathroom - calling her names and even joking about spitting in her food. When the friend returned, the author decided to inform her about what was said behind her back.

The author's intention appears to have been protective - they witnessed what they perceived as betrayal by fake friends and felt the victim deserved to know. However, the execution was problematic. They admitted to speaking ""maybe a bit loudly"" and may have embellished details (suggesting the friends might have actually spit in the food when they only heard them joke about it).

The two girls were clearly engaging in toxic behavior - talking badly about their friend behind her back while being supportive to her face, and making cruel jokes about tampering with her food.

However, the author inserted themselves into a situation they didn't fully understand, potentially escalating drama unnecessarily, and may have caused more harm than good by their approach.

While the author's core intention was arguably good (protecting someone from fake friends), their method was intrusive and potentially inflammatory.

The author is dealing with their mother's pancreatic cancer diagnosis and estate planning discussions. When the mother mentioned her husband (who previously cheated) offering to be executor, the author immediately expressed distrust and concerns about manipulation. The author is now questioning whether to continue sharing honest opinions or stay quiet.

Key factors:
- The mother is facing a terminal cancer diagnosis and trying to make important decisions
- The author has legitimate concerns based on the husband's past behavior (cheating, alleged manipulation)
- The timing is sensitive, but estate planning decisions are crucial and time-sensitive
- The author's intention appears to be protecting their mother's interests, not self-serving
- The mother specifically asked the author to be executor initially, suggesting she values their input
- These are practical, legal matters that will have lasting consequences

While the timing is unfortunate, the author has a responsibility to share relevant concerns about someone who will have significant control over the estate. The husband's history of infidelity and alleged manipulation is pertinent information for such an important decision.

The author has been having regular sleepovers with a male friend throughout the relationship without previous complaints from the boyfriend, and she's known this friend much longer. She also raises valid concerns about her boyfriend's dishonesty regarding his job and his own potentially inappropriate living situation.

However, the boyfriend's sudden upset about the sleepover could indicate changed feelings or circumstances we don't know about. While his previous acceptance doesn't necessarily mean he was always comfortable with it.

The key issues are:
- Lack of clear communication about boundaries in the relationship
- The boyfriend's dishonesty about his job situation
- Both parties seem to have trust issues
- The timing of this conflict after a 5-month break suggests unresolved relationship problems

While the author's frustration is understandable given the boyfriend's lies and his own questionable living arrangements, relationships require ongoing communication about comfort levels. The boyfriend's dishonesty is problematic, but that doesn't automatically invalidate his feelings about the sleepover situation.

This appears to be a relationship with fundamental communication and trust issues where both parties have contributed to the dysfunction.

The author is technically within their legal rights to maintain their custody schedule - they have a 50/50 agreement and have consistently upheld the ""no switching"" rule for 8 years. The ex-husband did schedule the Disney trip during the author's week without consulting them first.

However, this is an exceptional circumstance - a week-long family reunion at Disneyland that likely won't happen again for years, if ever. The rigid adherence to the custody schedule in this case is causing significant emotional distress to both children, who are old enough (especially the 16-year-old) to understand they're missing out on a major family experience.

While the ex-husband shouldn't have told the children about the trip before securing agreement, and his communication could have been better, the author's inflexibility seems primarily motivated by their ongoing conflict with their ex rather than what's genuinely best for the children. The author's own words suggest this may be retaliatory (""I blame him for it"").

- A mother and siblings who dislike the father due to his infidelity
- Their own conflicted feelings about their relationship with their father

The author acknowledges being ""lazy as FUCK"" and doing minimal household contributions while dealing with depression. While mental health struggles are real and valid, the author also seems to recognize this is an ongoing issue affecting the household dynamic.

The uncle's later messages show some accountability (admitting he was wrong to hit) but also problematic attitudes about obedience and control. The family's response suggesting ""both were wrong"" indicates this reflects broader household tensions about expectations and contributions.

Instead of having a direct conversation about feeling shut out or confused by the changes, she chose to gossip behind the author's back to mutual friends, created a hostile living environment by withholding shared resources, made accusations about tampering with belongings, and sent angry texts with name-calling. This passive-aggressive approach was immature and destructive.

Both parties contributed to this deteriorating situation through poor communication and stubborn pride. The author's secrecy and withdrawal started the problem, but the roommate's gossip campaign and hostile behavior escalated it significantly. Neither person took responsibility for addressing the conflict directly when it could have been resolved.

Anyway, I was talking to some guy as the character but ...",Author,Nobody,0.72,0.8,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the context and intentions involved.

The author was engaging in roleplay on a platform known for anonymous interactions, where using fictional personas is common and generally understood. While they did deceive someone by maintaining a fictional character, this occurred in a context where such roleplay is typical. When the conversation became more personal and the other person wanted to continue contact, the author chose to end it rather than continue the deception or send fake photos.

The author shows genuine concern about potentially hurting the other person and recognizes the ethical complexity of the situation. They were trying to avoid causing greater harm by not revealing the roleplay nature (which could have been more hurtful) while also not wanting to continue misleading someone who had developed what seemed like genuine feelings.

The other person, while understandably disappointed, was engaging on a platform where anonymous interactions and roleplay are common, so there was some implicit understanding that not everything might be as it appears.

This seems like a situation where someone got caught between the norms of an anonymous roleplay platform and genuine human connection, and tried to handle it as ethically as possible given the circumstances.

The author was clear about not wanting children from the beginning of the relationship and used contraceptives responsibly. When unexpectedly contacted months after the breakup about a pregnancy, he was honest about his position rather than giving false hope. While his immediate reaction of hanging up was harsh, the shock is understandable given his stated position on having children.

However, the author is seeking to completely abandon financial responsibility for a child that is biologically his. Regardless of his desires about parenthood, once a child exists, there are legal and moral obligations that come with biological parenthood. ""Financial abortion"" is not legally recognized in most jurisdictions specifically because children have rights to support from both biological parents.

The ex-girlfriend has the right to continue the pregnancy, but contacting him months later and suggesting they get back together shows some lack of consideration for the clear boundaries that were established.

The friends calling to pressure him are overstepping, though their concern for their friend is understandable.

While I have sympathy for the author's difficult situation, seeking to completely abandon responsibility for a child that will exist is problematic from both legal and ethical standpoints.

- Completely cutting off communication without attempting to address the issue first
- Blocking on all platforms immediately
- Not engaging when friends suggested unblocking

While the girl's initial violation was serious and her subsequent behavior was clearly problematic, the author's immediate escalation to total communication cutoff without any attempt at resolution was also somewhat extreme for what started as a boundary violation between friends.

1. Artistic concerns - they don't want to play a repetitive snare part for what they consider a mediocre arrangement that inappropriately borrows from Ravel's Bolero
2. Time constraints - they already have significant professional commitments with their own quartet and freelance composition work

The author has no obligation to participate in someone else's creative project, especially when they have legitimate artistic objections and existing professional commitments. The acquaintance already has a snare player, so this isn't leaving them without options - it's just that the acquaintance is being picky about the current player's performance.

The author was asked to be a bridesmaid for someone she hadn't spoken to in years, which rekindled their friendship. After the wedding, the friend completely stopped communicating for 4 months without explanation. When the author got engaged and chose her closest friends as bridesmaids (which seems reasonable given the circumstances), the friend complained behind her back about not being chosen or personally notified.

The friend's expectation seems unreasonable - she cut off communication entirely after her wedding, yet expected to automatically be chosen as a bridesmaid and to receive personal notification about not being selected. The author chose people she was actually close to at the time, which is the normal approach to wedding planning.

While the author could have potentially reached out during those 4 months of silence or given a heads up about the bridesmaid selection, she had no obligation to do so given that the friend had initiated the communication breakdown. The friend's behavior of complaining behind the author's back rather than addressing concerns directly is also problematic.

The father currently has a court-ordered arrangement giving him 8 days per month with his son, while the mother has 22 days. The mother is asking him to give up half of his already limited time (reducing it to just 4 days per month) because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with their son during her 22 days.

The father's position is reasonable - he already has very limited time with his child and looks forward to their weekends together. The mother's request would drastically reduce his parenting time from an already minimal amount. Her reasoning that school makes it hard to find time during her 22 days suggests the issue is more about her time management than a genuine need for more custody time.

If the mother truly needs schedule adjustments due to school, there are other solutions like temporary schedule modifications during exam periods, or working around her school schedule rather than taking away the father's limited time entirely.

The father is not being unreasonable by wanting to maintain his court-ordered time with his child, especially given how little time he already has.

The author has clearly communicated their boundaries multiple times - they don't enjoy silent phone calls and value their commute time for work preparation and personal mental prep. This is a reasonable boundary. When directly asked if they wanted to get off the phone, they gave an honest answer rather than being passive-aggressive.

However, the fiancé's behavior is problematic in several ways:
- Repeatedly ignoring clearly stated boundaries about the silent phone calls
- Calling multiple times during work hours when the author is trying to focus
- Setting up a trap question (""so you just WANT to get off the phone with me?"") and then getting angry at the honest response
- Escalating to verbal abuse (""hopes I have a great fucking day"") when her feelings were hurt
- Calling back multiple times after hanging up angrily
- Using silent treatment as a manipulation tactic

While the author could potentially have been more diplomatic in their response, they were put in an impossible position by the trap question. Being honest about wanting to end an unproductive conversation isn't inherently wrong, especially after repeatedly expressing this boundary.

The fiancé's pattern of behavior - ignoring boundaries, emotional manipulation, verbal abuse when confronted, and using guilt trips - places the primary fault with her.

The brother missed the birthday party, citing work the next day and the long drive. While the author calculates that it was technically feasible (getting home by 10-11 PM for a 9 AM start), this doesn't account for the brother's personal energy levels, potential traffic, or other factors that might make this genuinely difficult.

The brother is trying to make amends by offering to throw a mini party, which shows he cares and wants to repair the relationship. The author's rigid ""no do-overs"" policy seems unnecessarily punitive and doesn't allow for the reality that sometimes people make judgment calls about what they can handle, even if others disagree with those calls.

The author appears to be prioritizing being ""right"" about whether the brother could have attended over maintaining a good relationship. While it's understandable to feel hurt when someone misses an important event, completely rejecting genuine attempts to make up for it seems harsh and counterproductive.

The author is being generous by using their travel points for accommodation and is already investing significant time and money to attend a wedding for people they don't know personally. They've found a practical solution that saves money while still being very close to the wedding venue (10-minute walk).

The girlfriend wants to stay with the wedding party at the designated hotel, which is understandable from a social/convenience standpoint since she's in the wedding party. However, she's insisting on this despite the significant additional cost ($500 total) when a free, nearby alternative exists.

Both parties have legitimate concerns - the author about unnecessary expenses when they're already making sacrifices, and the girlfriend about being close to her wedding party duties and social obligations. However, the girlfriend's insistence on the more expensive option without apparent willingness to compromise or cover the additional cost herself seems unreasonable, especially given that the author is already being quite accommodating.

The other person seems to be enthusiastic about sharing their cultural background and heritage, which is understandable, especially if they're in a new place. However, dominating conversations with repetitive monologues without reading social cues or allowing for reciprocal dialogue isn't great conversational etiquette either.

The author could have handled this more tactfully - perhaps suggesting they talk about something else, or finding a kinder way to redirect the conversation. Calling someone's passionate topic ""meaningless"" is quite harsh. On the other hand, the other person could be more aware of whether their conversation partner is engaged and avoid monopolizing discussions.

However, the author's plan to simply stop responding and ghost her rather than having a direct conversation about his frustrations is also problematic. While his frustration is completely understandable, choosing to end things by going silent rather than communicating his feelings is not the most mature approach.

- They haven't expressed their disappointment to their friend
- They plan to try the game they received
- They recognize their friend is going through a tough time
- The gift was meant as a reward for the author's support

However, the author is still disappointed and is considering continuing to hint about the other game ""after a little while,"" which suggests they may not fully appreciate the gesture or understand appropriate gift-receiving etiquette.

While it's natural to have initial feelings of disappointment when expectations aren't met, dwelling on it and planning to continue hinting about a different game shows a lack of appreciation for what was clearly a thoughtful gesture from someone going through difficulties. The friend chose to spend their money on a gift they thought the author would enjoy, based on the author's positive comments about it.

The author admits he ""never said any of that feely shit"" and assumed it was ""pretty clear"" this was just a hookup.

Despite recognizing these red flags that suggested she might not share his casual approach, he proceeded without clarifying expectations.

After the hookup, when Cindy reached out asking about future plans - a clear indication she had different expectations - the author chose to ignore her completely rather than have an honest conversation. This ""ghosting"" approach, while he considers it normal behavior, is hurtful and disrespectful, especially given the signs he observed about her emotional state.

While Cindy could have been more direct about her expectations upfront, the author had more information (recognizing her inexperience and attachment) and more power in this situation to prevent the misunderstanding.

The author is asking for some time together after handling household responsibilities (dishes, dinner prep, gift wrapping) while the husband has been watching streams most of the day. Her request seems reasonable - wanting to spend part of the evening together as a couple.

The husband's response is concerning in several ways:
1. He flatly refuses without attempting compromise
2. He tries to monetize the situation by demanding $100 to stop watching
3. This connects to a previous pattern of excessive spending ($2,000+ on the same game) that he had agreed to stop

While the author could have communicated her desire for couple time earlier in the day, her expectations aren't unrealistic. Wanting some focused time with your partner, especially after contributing significantly to household tasks, is a normal relationship need.

The fiancé's behavior of leaving explicit content open on a shared device shows poor judgment and consideration. However, the author's immediate leap to restricting his access to their children and assuming potential danger based solely on pornography consumption is a significant escalation that could be seen as an overreaction.

3. Dave had ""managed to fix it"" previously
4. The strings broke again after just ""a few minutes"" of use

This suggests the strings were in poor condition and likely to break regardless of who was using the device. When you borrow something that's already damaged or in poor repair, and it breaks during normal use, the responsibility typically falls on the owner who lent out equipment they knew was compromised.

Dave chose to lend out a Diabolo with strings he knew were worn and previously broken. The fact that they broke again after just a few minutes of normal use indicates this was due to the pre-existing wear rather than misuse by the author.

The author's family has reasonable food preferences - the children politely decline foods with ingredients they don't like, which is completely normal. The author handled the immediate situation by protecting their child (who is on the autism spectrum) from being pressured to eat something they didn't want.

Harriet's behavior is problematic - she pushed food on children after being politely declined, put food on a child's plate without permission, and then got upset when he didn't eat it. This kind of food-pushing behavior, especially toward a child on the spectrum, crosses appropriate boundaries.

The MIL's suggestion that the author should have been ""kinder"" and encouraged the child to taste it misses the point - the author was protecting their child from unwanted pressure, which is good parenting.

The author admits they could have been more polite, but given that Harriet was engaging in ""moderately aggressive boundary pushing"" with their special needs child, the author's protective response was justified and appropriate.

The roommate has developed a habit of leaving at risky times for the bus (3 minutes before it arrives) and then expecting the author to bail her out when she inevitably misses it. This shows poor planning and creates an unfair expectation that the author will always be available as backup transportation. The passive-aggressive comment about having to ""walk 20 minutes in the cold"" while standing in the doorway was clearly meant to guilt the author into offering a ride.

However, the author has enabled this pattern by consistently providing rides in the past without ever addressing the underlying issue - that the roommate needs to leave earlier to catch her bus reliably.

835,"My girlfriend and I have been together for a year. We've always had a very active sex life, but recently I am beginning to feel like she manipulates me with sex. She'll ask for kisses all the time and...",Author,Other,0.75,0.5833333333333334,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the dynamics of consent, boundaries, and communication in the relationship.

The author has identified a concerning pattern where their girlfriend continues to initiate physical contact (passionate kissing) that she knows will arouse them, even after they've explicitly said no to sex. This appears to be a boundary violation. The girlfriend seems to be using physical intimacy as a way to override the author's stated boundaries, which is problematic regardless of gender.

The author has communicated their discomfort with this pattern and asked for space, which is a reasonable request. However, the girlfriend became angry rather than respecting these boundaries or engaging in productive dialogue about their different needs.

While relationships require compromise and both partners may have legitimate needs for affection and intimacy, using arousal as a tool to circumvent a partner's ""no"" crosses into manipulative territory. The timing (after fights, in public) also suggests poor judgment about appropriate contexts for intimate behavior.

The author appears to be trying to establish healthy boundaries while still acknowledging their partner's need for affection, which seems like a reasonable approach to the conflict.

The author's position is that as the host who invited everyone to his place for an after-party, Mitch should cover the transportation costs to get there - similar to how when they host at their place, they provide all the refreshments without asking for reimbursement.

Mitch's position is that since they all shared the cab, they should split the fare equally regardless of who suggested the destination.

Both positions have some merit. However, there are a few key factors that tip this toward the author being reasonable:

1. Mitch was the one who insisted they come to his place despite the author's initial hesitation
2. The author correctly predicted Mitch would pass out early, making the trip largely pointless
3. There's an established pattern where hosts (including the author) typically absorb hosting costs
4. The author and her husband ended up paying significantly more overall ($26 total) to get home after the failed gathering

While Mitch isn't entirely unreasonable for thinking shared rides mean shared costs, his insistence on payment after being a poor host (passing out early, not having adequate refreshments) and after convincing reluctant friends to make the trip seems petty and goes against reasonable hosting etiquette.

The author could have handled the conflict more diplomatically, but her underlying position about host responsibilities is sound.

My GF and I (both late 20s) have been together for about a year and a half. When I met...",Author,Author,0.72,0.9666666666666667,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the communication breakdown, financial dynamics, and how both parties handled the conflict.

The author's girlfriend was clearly struggling financially due to medical debt but had explicitly told him early on that her finances were ""none of his business."" She was trying to maintain independence while secretly dealing with food insecurity. When she asked for $2 for a tamale after not eating at brunch, she was likely genuinely hungry but too proud to admit her financial struggles.

However, the author couldn't reasonably be expected to read her mind about her financial situation when she had specifically kept him in the dark. His frustration about her eye-rolling at the bill and apparent contradiction (claiming not to be hungry, then wanting food) is understandable from his perspective.

The critical moment was when she finally revealed she was ""food insecure"" and explained why she hadn't eaten at brunch - she literally couldn't afford both the meal and having money left over. At this point, the author's response of snapping at her and dismissing her explanation as likely false shows a lack of empathy and understanding.

The girlfriend's approach of keeping financial struggles secret while subtly relying on him to pick up more bills wasn't ideal communication. However, her behavior stems from pride, shame, and past trauma around poverty - understandable human responses.

The author's dismissive attitude toward her ""food insecure"" claim and framing this as ""mooching"" when she's clearly struggling with medical debt from an accident shows a concerning lack of compassion for his partner of 1.5 years.

The author is expressing legitimate concerns about inconsistent parenting approaches and how bribing children with sweets for basic behaviors could create problematic expectations. These are valid parenting concerns that many couples face.

However, the author's approach was quite harsh. Calling the children potential ""assholes"" and describing the wife's coping strategy in such judgmental terms shows a lack of empathy for her situation. The wife is managing two young children alone for a week at a time while also working - this is genuinely challenging.

The wife's response indicates she feels judged rather than supported, and she's asking for understanding about her survival strategies during solo parenting periods.

While both parents have valid points (concerns about consistency vs. need for practical solutions during difficult periods), the author's delivery was unnecessarily harsh and unsupportive. The wife is doing her best in a challenging situation, and constructive dialogue would be more appropriate than criticism.

The core issue isn't the parenting disagreement itself, but how the author chose to express their concerns without acknowledging the difficulty of the wife's situation or offering collaborative solutions.

839,"My girlfriend is 18, so it's illegal for her to drink here. I don't worry about the law too much, but I'm concerned for her health when she drinks, even though it's not that often. Usually when she do...",Other,Nobody,0.78,0.42857142857142855,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to evaluate whether the author's concerns and actions are reasonable or problematic.

The author is expressing worry about their 18-year-old girlfriend's occasional drinking of low-alcohol beverages with friends. Their response is to give gentle reminders to ""be safe, don't drink too much"" without trying to control or stop her behavior. They're questioning whether their concern is rational and seeking advice.

The author's behavior appears reasonable and caring:
- They acknowledge the legal issue but focus on health concerns
- They recognize the drinking is infrequent and low-risk (low alcohol content, with friends)
- They express concern without being controlling
- They're self-reflective about whether their worry is appropriate
- They explicitly state they don't try to stop her

The girlfriend appears to be drinking responsibly - occasionally, with friends, and choosing lower alcohol content drinks. There's no indication of problematic behavior.

This seems like a normal relationship dynamic where one partner expresses reasonable concern for the other's wellbeing without overstepping boundaries. The author is being thoughtful and non-controlling while caring about their partner's safety.

The author made several problematic decisions:
1. Made judgmental comments about their sister's traumatic past, questioning her agency as a victim of abuse and trafficking
2. Decided unilaterally that the sister was ""concealing something major"" without knowing the full situation
3. Violated their sister's privacy and autonomy by disclosing deeply personal trauma without consent
4. After causing this harm, demanded an apology from the boyfriend rather than acknowledging their own wrongdoing

The sister's boyfriend's reaction, while intense, appears to be protective anger toward someone who just violated his partner's privacy regarding serious trauma. His response suggests he may have already known about the situation.

The sister's response of cutting contact is a reasonable boundary after such a significant betrayal of trust.

The author's actions stem from judgmental attitudes about abuse victims and a fundamental misunderstanding of consent and privacy. Disclosing someone else's trauma, especially involving abuse and trafficking, without their permission is a serious violation regardless of intent.

The author is dealing with their father who abandoned them as an infant and is now trying to reconnect after 20 years via Facebook. The author feels resentment about the abandonment and is overwhelmed by this sudden contact, especially given they're already dealing with other life stresses. They're questioning whether they're wrong for not wanting to forgive or engage with their father.

The father left when the author was 4 months old under unclear circumstances (possibly drug-related) and stayed away for nearly two decades. While he may sound apologetic now, the timing and method of contact (Facebook messenger for such a significant life event) shows poor judgment. However, the author isn't obligated to forgive or have a relationship with someone who abandoned them, regardless of apologies.

The author has every right to set boundaries about who they allow in their life, especially someone who caused significant harm through abandonment. Feeling resentful and being cautious about reconnecting is completely understandable and not unreasonable. The author isn't being vindictive or cruel - they're protecting their emotional wellbeing during an already difficult time.

This appears to be a situation where the author is processing legitimate feelings about abandonment and has valid reasons for their hesitation to reconnect.

Almost missed a graduation party because the invite came through f...",Other,Other,0.72,0.5294117647058824,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider both perspectives and the underlying dynamics.

The author has clearly established boundaries around social media use - they don't engage with it, don't post, and have consistently maintained this position. They've explained their reasoning (preferring to live in the moment, not wanting validation online) and have demonstrated their commitment to the relationship through substantial real-world actions (spending 4-6 days together weekly, involving their children, planning trips together).

The girlfriend's desire for some form of public acknowledgment isn't inherently unreasonable - many people do value having their relationships recognized publicly. However, her response seems disproportionate. Rather than having a calm discussion about why this matters to her or exploring compromises, she became upset and tried to ""force it down his throat."" More concerning is her reliance on advice from a friend who is clearly in a dysfunctional relationship pattern herself.

The author's communication appears direct but not cruel - they explained their position, stood firm on their boundaries, and pointed out the contradiction in taking relationship advice from someone with ongoing relationship instability.

While the author could potentially have been more empathetic about why this might matter to their girlfriend, they're not obligated to change fundamental aspects of how they engage with social media, especially when they're demonstrating commitment in numerous other meaningful ways.

The author and friend entered into a game-sharing arrangement where they split costs but the games were purchased through the author's account. Now the author wants to break this arrangement unilaterally, which would:

1. Make the friend lose access to games he helped pay for
2. Give the author sole access to games the friend co-funded
3. Essentially result in the friend losing his financial investment

While the author has the technical ability to do this and has a legitimate desire to play games during their offline trip, doing so would be unfair to the friend who contributed financially to these purchases. The friend would lose access to games he helped buy, with no compensation or alternative solution being offered.

The author acknowledges this was a ""gigantic mistake"" in terms of the arrangement, but that doesn't justify unilaterally changing the terms in a way that financially harms the friend. A fair approach would involve discussing alternatives, such as temporary changes, compensation, or finding other solutions.

For example, he o...",Other,Other,0.75,0.6666666666666666,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the expectations and communication dynamics at play.

The father's behavior seems problematic in several ways:
1. He's imposing gift-giving obligations on his adult children without discussion
2. When questioned about this expectation, he ""completely blew up"" rather than having a reasonable conversation
3. He used guilt tactics, calling his child ""cheap"" and questioning their love for their mother
4. He's essentially dictating how his adult children should express their relationship with their mother

The author appears to be reasonably questioning what seems like an unusual expectation (separate Valentine's gifts from adult children to their mother) and asking for clarification in a respectful way. The explosive reaction suggests the father may be unreasonable in his demands.

The mother doesn't appear to be involved in creating these expectations, and the brother seems to be avoiding conflict rather than contributing to it.

While family gift-giving traditions can vary, the father's aggressive response to a reasonable question and his attempt to guilt-trip his child into compliance crosses a line.

The author is grappling with their partner's gender transition and recognizing that their sexual orientation (straight) may not be compatible with dating someone who identifies as male. They express genuine love for their partner while acknowledging their own limitations regarding attraction and sexual orientation.

The partner has opened up about their gender identity, which is a vulnerable and important step in their personal journey. There's no indication they're pressuring the author or being unreasonable.

This appears to be a situation where two people who care about each other are facing an incompatibility that neither person created or can fully control. Sexual orientation and gender identity are both fundamental aspects of who people are. The author isn't rejecting their partner out of malice or prejudice, but rather recognizing a genuine incompatibility with their own sexual orientation.

While the situation is painful for both parties, neither person is acting wrongly. The author is being honest about their feelings and limitations, and the partner is being authentic about their identity.

The brother-in-law has significant issues - multiple jail sentences, inability to hold jobs, lost license, living off government assistance while being the sole non-contributor in a household where his partner supports the family. These are legitimate concerns about his life choices and their impact on the family.

However, the author's response crosses important lines. Telling someone they ""shouldn't even be allowed to have an opinion"" because they don't pay taxes or contribute to society attacks fundamental democratic principles. Everyone has the right to political expression regardless of their economic status or life circumstances. The author also chose to publicly shame the brother-in-law on social media rather than addressing concerns privately or simply unfriending/unfollowing him.

While the brother-in-law's life choices are problematic, having political opinions and expressing them (even unpopular ones) isn't inherently wrong. The author's reaction was disproportionate and attacked the brother-in-law's basic rights rather than addressing the legitimate behavioral issues.

The author escalated a situation that could have been handled more appropriately, resulting in family conflict that has damaged relationships.

About 2 months ago, he let me look a...",Other,Other,0.85,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to evaluate whether the author's reaction to finding intimate photos of her boyfriend's ex on his phone is reasonable or not.

The key facts are:
- They're in an exclusive, serious relationship of 5 months
- The boyfriend took close-up photos of his ex's body without her knowledge while she was playing with their child
- When confronted, he showed no remorse and said it ""doesn't mean anything""
- He admitted it's ""hard to let go"" of his ex
- The author feels this is a form of infidelity and is questioning their relationship

The boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic on multiple levels:
1. Taking intimate photos of someone without consent (his ex)
2. Violating the trust and boundaries of his current relationship
3. Showing no remorse when confronted
4. Dismissing his girlfriend's legitimate feelings

The author's reaction - feeling hurt, betrayed, and questioning the relationship - is entirely reasonable given the circumstances. She discovered evidence of her boyfriend secretly sexualizing his ex and taking non-consensual photos, which would understandably make anyone question their partner's faithfulness and respect for boundaries.

The author is not at fault for having normal emotional reactions to discovering concerning behavior, nor for confronting her partner about it.

The author clearly communicated their desire to get to know other people in the class and made a reasonable choice to dance with someone new. They were trying to maintain appropriate boundaries after being rejected by this person, which is healthy behavior.

The other person's reaction seems problematic - they appear to have an expectation of exclusive attention despite having rejected the author romantically. Their comment about ""you had to look at me before you looked at him, and you still chose him"" and expecting to dance together just because they walked in together shows possessive behavior and unrealistic expectations.

The author was trying to balance maintaining the friendship while creating necessary emotional distance, and choosing different dance partners in a class specifically designed for partner rotation is completely reasonable and normal.

The boyfriend is clearly struggling with his sexual identity - he's engaged in sexual activities with men, watches gay porn, but insists he's straight. This suggests internal conflict, possibly stemming from his family history as the author mentions.

However, the key issue here is that the author, despite good intentions, is repeatedly pushing the boyfriend to accept a bisexual label after he has explicitly asked her to stop. Even after he ""blows up"" and says he's ""tired of me trying to say he is,"" she continues to insist he should ""just accept it."" This crosses the line from supportive into pressuring someone about their sexual identity.

While the author's intentions seem genuine - she wants him to be comfortable with himself and draws from her own experience - she's not respecting his autonomy over his own identity labels. Sexual identity is deeply personal, and people need to come to their own conclusions in their own time. The boyfriend may be in denial, but that's his journey to navigate.

The author is pushing boundaries that have been clearly established, even if those boundaries stem from the boyfriend's internal struggles.
