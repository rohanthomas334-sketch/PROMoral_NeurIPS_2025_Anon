However, my parents didn't want to help me in any...",Author,Everybody,0.8,1.0,True,"Looking at this complex and painful situation, I need to consider the different aspects carefully.

The author describes a history of severe abuse from their father, including physical violence and attempts on their life. They're now living in what they perceive as an unsafe environment with a father who has significant cognitive decline following a stroke. When hearing their father choking, their first reaction was relief and hope that he would die, rather than helping.

While the author's feelings are understandable given the trauma they've endured, actively hoping for someone's death during a medical emergency crosses an ethical line. However, this reaction stems from years of abuse and current unsafe living conditions that aren't being addressed by other family members.

The mother is also problematic - she's enabling the dangerous situation by refusing to acknowledge the father's condition or take appropriate action, despite being warned multiple times about safety concerns. She's also showing favoritism by supporting one child while leaving the other in a harmful situation.

The father, while now cognitively impaired, was previously abusive to the point of attempted murder according to the author's account.

This appears to be a situation where multiple people bear responsibility - the author for their reaction during the medical emergency, the mother for enabling the dangerous situation and refusing to act, and the father for his history of abuse (though his current cognitive state complicates his culpability for present actions).

The author is in an agreed-upon open relationship where both partners can see other people. The core issue is that they're upset their SO is having sex with others but not with them, despite the author also having sex with others (including an ex).

Key considerations:
- Both partners agreed to an open relationship
- Both partners are exercising that agreement by seeing others
- The author is upset about something they're also doing
- The lack of intimacy between the primary partners is a separate relationship issue from the open arrangement
- The author hasn't communicated their feelings to their SO

The author acknowledges they might be a ""hypocrite"" - and they're right. They're doing the exact same thing (seeking sex outside the relationship) while being upset that their partner is doing it too. The open relationship agreement doesn't guarantee sex within the primary relationship, and being jealous about agreed-upon behavior while engaging in the same behavior themselves shows a double standard.

However, their feelings about the lack of intimacy in their primary relationship are valid - that's a separate issue that needs communication and work, not blame.

The author is being hypocritical and unfair in their judgment while not addressing the real underlying relationship issues through proper communication.

To tell this story right we need to rewind nearly 4 years ago. Where I was Tinder-ing it...",Author,Author,0.8,0.7272727272727273,True,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author had a sexual relationship with someone who then chose to be exclusive with another person. When she became pregnant, the timing suggested the author could be the father, but she publicly claimed the other man was the father. The author suspected the child might be his based on physical features but didn't act on it for years.

The key moment is when the author encountered the presumed father at a supermarket. When this man mentioned the baby doesn't look like him, the author responded by saying the baby looks like him and then explained his suspicions about potentially being the father.

While the author's curiosity and desire for truth is understandable, the way he handled this was problematic. He chose to reveal his suspicions to the presumed father in a casual supermarket encounter rather than addressing this directly with the mother first. This approach was likely to cause maximum disruption to their family situation. If he genuinely believed he might be the father, the appropriate course would have been to privately approach the mother about getting a paternity test, not to plant seeds of doubt with her partner in a chance encounter.

The mother's angry reaction, while intense, is understandable given that the author's revelation has potentially destabilized her relationship and family unit. However, if she has been dishonest about paternity, that's also problematic.

The author bears primary responsibility for how he chose to handle his suspicions.

You clearly communicated your stance on not wanting children early in the relationship (around the 6th month mark), and your boyfriend agreed at that time. You both made plans based on this mutual understanding. However, after getting a puppy, your boyfriend appears to have changed his mind and is now frequently bringing up having children, even making jokes about pregnancy and converting rooms for babies.

This is a fundamental incompatibility issue where neither person is inherently wrong for their feelings. You're not at fault for maintaining your consistent position on not wanting children - this is a valid life choice that you communicated clearly from early on. Your boyfriend isn't necessarily at fault for his feelings potentially changing over time, as people can evolve. However, the way he's handling it (constant mentions and jokes after you've been clear about your position) is problematic.

The author admits they ""deserved"" the low grade because they ""spent barely any time"" on the coursework. When offered legitimate help (extra time and tutoring), they declined due to their own scheduling constraints. Then they made what appears to be a veiled threat about reporting the teacher to administration, essentially implying inappropriate behavior to coerce a grade change.

While the author claims the teacher ""stares"" and is ""creepy,"" this seems to be subjective interpretation rather than documented inappropriate behavior. The teacher's offer to provide extra help and tutoring time is actually appropriate educational support.

The teacher's response of offering to raise the grade to avoid the complaint is problematic and unprofessional - they should have maintained the grade and reported the attempted coercion. However, this appears to be a defensive reaction to what amounts to academic blackmail.

The author is using unsubstantiated allegations of inappropriate behavior as leverage to get an unearned grade improvement. This is manipulative and potentially damaging to the teacher's reputation and career. The fact that they ""felt really bad"" afterward suggests they recognize this was wrong.

The core issue is the author attempting to coerce a grade change through implied threats rather than earning it through academic work.

So about a week or so before Valentine's Day, she and I agree that neither of us will give the othe...",Author,Author,0.8,0.5714285714285714,False,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author made an agreement with his girlfriend that neither would give traditional Valentine's gifts, but he secretly planned to surprise her with flowers anyway. His intention was to do something nice while she wouldn't feel obligated to reciprocate.

However, this created several problems:
1. He deliberately broke their mutual agreement, even if with good intentions
2. By surprising her after they'd agreed on no gifts, he put her in an awkward position where she had nothing to give in return
3. He made a unilateral decision to change their agreement without consulting her
4. His girlfriend's negative reaction suggests she valued honoring their agreement and may have felt deceived or put on the spot

While his intentions were romantic, the author failed to respect the boundary they had mutually established. Good intentions don't excuse breaking agreements, especially when the other person clearly valued sticking to what they had decided together.

The girlfriend's upset reaction was reasonable given that he violated their agreement, even if done with romantic intentions.

The author was in an intimate situation with someone, realized they weren't physically attracted, and then ended things by giving what appears to be a dishonest reason (""personal problems"" and ""not ready for a relationship"") rather than the real reason (lack of physical attraction).

Key considerations:
- Physical attraction is not something people can control - you either feel it or you don't
- The author had the right to end the encounter/relationship for any reason
- However, the author chose to lie about the reason rather than being honest or tactfully declining
- The timing (one hour after seeing her naked) and the dishonest explanation could be hurtful and misleading to the other person
- The other person doesn't appear to have done anything wrong

While the author had every right to end things due to lack of attraction, the way they handled it - with a dishonest explanation that could leave the other person confused or give them false hope about the author's availability for future relationships - was not ideal. A more honest but tactful approach would have been better.

The author is an experienced writer who understands the publishing industry and has been genuinely trying to help their friend. They provided editing assistance, structural feedback, and realistic advice about the publishing process. When the friend became unrealistic about sending an unfinished, poorly written manuscript to agencies, the author tried to manage expectations gently at first, then more directly.

The friend, however, has shown a pattern of not following through on projects, difficulty accepting feedback, and unrealistic expectations fueled by one overly enthusiastic review. When given honest, industry-informed advice, she responded by calling the author unsupportive and a bad friend.

The author's advice was factually correct - sending an unfinished manuscript written in a non-native language without proper editing to literary agencies is indeed unlikely to succeed and could potentially harm future submissions. While the delivery might have felt harsh to the friend, the author had already tried gentler approaches that were ignored.

The friend's reaction suggests she wanted validation rather than honest feedback, and she's shooting the messenger rather than considering the merit of the advice. The author was trying to prevent their friend from potentially damaging her reputation with agencies by submitting subpar work.

This appears to be a case where honest advice was poorly received, but the advice itself was sound and well-intentioned.

The author had a legitimate grievance - repeated, audible farting in a public space like a bar is genuinely inconsiderate behavior that affects other patrons' experience. However, the way they handled it was problematic.

While the author had every right to be bothered by the situation, publicly calling someone out and telling them to ""quit farting that it's disgusting and fucking rude"" was unnecessarily harsh and humiliating. There were better approaches available - they could have quietly asked the bartender to intervene, moved to a different spot temporarily, or addressed it more diplomatically.

The person doing the repeated farting was being inconsiderate, especially in a social setting where people are trying to enjoy food and drinks. Even if unintentional, continuing this behavior without attempting to step away or address it shows a lack of awareness for others.

The bartender's reaction seems disproportionate - while she may have been concerned about losing customers, aggressively confronting a patron who raised a legitimate hygiene concern isn't professional. However, she may have been trying to maintain a welcoming environment.

The author escalated the situation unnecessarily with their blunt approach, but they weren't wrong about the underlying issue. The other patron was being inconsiderate, and the bartender overreacted.

The author has legitimate concerns about parking issues and potential zoning violations. Running an unlicensed auto repair business in a residential area with 8-12 cars parked on public streets does create real problems for neighbors and may violate local ordinances.

However, the author shows awareness of the broader gentrification context - they're new residents in a rapidly changing neighborhood where this business has operated for years without complaint. They recognize the optics of white newcomers reporting long-established Hispanic businesses.

The key factors:
- The parking problem affects all neighbors, not just the author
- Zoning laws exist for legitimate safety and community reasons
- The business operator chose to run an unlicensed operation knowing the risks
- The author is considering legal reporting mechanisms, not vigilante action

While the timing and context are sensitive, the author isn't creating fake problems or targeting someone based on ethnicity. They're dealing with genuine quality-of-life issues that would be problematic regardless of who was involved.

The author is legally fulfilling their court-ordered obligations by paying child support and taking scheduled visitation. However, when a child develops a serious medical condition like epilepsy, the situation fundamentally changes from the original custody arrangement made when the child was healthy.

Key issues:
1. The author refuses to help with medical expenses for their child's serious condition
2. They won't adjust their schedule to attend medical appointments or meet with doctors for potentially beneficial treatment
3. They refuse to provide any additional childcare to help the mother work and pay mounting medical bills
4. They dismiss the medical trial as ""unnecessary"" despite doctor recommendations
5. They refuse to contribute even a small amount toward specialized epilepsy camp

While the author isn't legally required to pay beyond court-ordered support, they are morally obligated as a parent to prioritize their child's medical needs. The rigid stance of ""I only do what's required"" when facing a child's serious health crisis shows a concerning lack of parental responsibility.

The mother is trying to secure the best possible care for their child, including specialized programs and medical trials that could improve the child's condition. The author's inflexibility is potentially harming their child's medical care and putting unfair burden on the custodial parent.

Being a ""poor college student"" doesn't absolve someone of parental duties when their child faces a medical emergency. Even small contributions or schedule adjustments could make a significant difference.

3. Sleep on the couch while they use his bed
4. Wake up at 4am Friday to drive them to the airport
5. Disrupt his autistic sister's sleep schedule (she normally wakes at 7am)

Key considerations:
- Both women have cars and can drive
- The author offered reasonable alternatives (paying for Uber/Lyft)
- The sister chose to fly instead of driving 3 hours, creating the pickup need
- The author is a caregiver for his autistic sister, making schedule disruptions more significant
- The sister has a pattern of being ungrateful and demanding
- The girlfriend dismissed his concerns about safety with rideshare

The author is being asked to provide extensive free transportation services that significantly disrupt his caregiving responsibilities, when viable alternatives exist. His girlfriend is prioritizing convenience over his legitimate concerns about his sister's care routine. The sister's choice to fly instead of drive created this burden.

The author has been genuinely helpful to their friend - providing rides, buying food/drinks, and being supportive during financial difficulties. The friend has reciprocated when possible, showing this wasn't a one-sided relationship.

However, the author accidentally damaged the friend's laptop by throwing something at them, which led to a fight and a promise to never touch the computer again. When the author later needed to borrow the laptop for a quiz, the friend initially said no - which is completely reasonable given the previous damage and promise.

The key issues with the author's behavior:

2. They stormed out dramatically instead of having a mature conversation
3. They're now giving the silent treatment despite the friend trying to communicate

The author paid back their own portion promptly, which was responsible. However, they're now being asked to cover Judy's portion simply because they have savings, which puts them in an uncomfortable position.

Olivia initially offered to pay for both friends' trips, but then tried to shift Judy's debt to the author based solely on the author's financial capacity. This creates an awkward dynamic and wasn't part of the original arrangement.

Judy accepted a trip she apparently couldn't afford and hasn't paid back what she owes, leaving others to handle her financial responsibility.

The author is frustrated but feels unable to address this directly due to their housing dependency on Judy, which creates a power imbalance.

While the author could have been clearer about boundaries upfront, they fulfilled their own financial obligation and shouldn't be expected to cover someone else's debt just because they have savings. The main issues stem from Olivia's inappropriate request and Judy's failure to handle her own financial responsibilities.

The author deliberately and repeatedly lied about their middle name over the course of a two-year relationship, planning to continue this deception indefinitely until marriage or beyond. This wasn't a simple misunderstanding or forgotten correction - it was an intentional, ongoing deception framed as a ""practical joke.""

While a middle name might seem trivial, the issue isn't the significance of the information itself, but rather:
1. The deliberate choice to lie repeatedly
2. The planning to continue the deception long-term
3. The breach of trust in a committed relationship where they're discussing marriage

The boyfriend's reaction of calling it ""weird"" and being upset is understandable - discovering that your partner has been deliberately lying to you about anything for two years would be concerning and hurtful, regardless of how minor the topic seems.

The author acknowledges lying multiple times and had a ""long term plan"" to continue the deception, which goes well beyond a harmless joke into territory that damages trust in the relationship.

The author is experiencing legitimate workplace frustration - they're covering shifts frequently with promises that aren't being kept, can't get their own time off approved, and are feeling exhausted. These are valid concerns about workplace fairness and reciprocity.

However, the core issue here appears to be a management problem rather than solely about the coworker. The manager is responsible for:
- Ensuring fair distribution of shifts and coverage
- Honoring promises made to employees about benefits/reciprocal coverage
- Managing time-off requests equitably
- Preventing any single employee from being overburdened

The coworker does bear some responsibility for not reciprocating shift coverage and potentially taking advantage of others' willingness to help. However, employees are generally entitled to request time off, and the approval/coverage system should be managed fairly by leadership.

The author isn't at fault for feeling frustrated - these are reasonable concerns about workplace equity. They're not being unreasonable in wanting reciprocity and fair treatment.

The author's concerns about the relationship seem to stem from observing what they perceive as imbalanced dynamics - Avery using Kylie's belongings, different cleaning habits, and the rapid progression of the relationship. However, these observations are filtered through the author's perspective as an outsider.

The key issues with the author's approach:
1. **Timing and delivery**: Choosing to express these concerns only after an engagement announcement, and in a confrontational way at Kylie's workplace, was poorly timed and hurtful.

2. **Assumptions about the relationship**: The author is making judgments about private relationship dynamics they may not fully understand. What looks like ""using"" from the outside could be normal sharing between committed partners.

3. **Unsolicited criticism**: While Kylie did ask why the author didn't respond, this escalated into unsolicited relationship advice that crossed boundaries.

4. **Ultimatum approach**: Declaring they won't attend the wedding and don't support the relationship is an extreme response that forces Kylie to choose between her friend and her partner.

However, Kylie also contributed by:
- Pressuring the author to explain their lack of response
- Asking for honesty but then getting angry when receiving it

The author initially planned a brief 30-minute visit to their mother for Mother's Day, and when their 6-year-old asked to come along, they said yes. This seems reasonable - it's a short visit to see grandma.

The partner then objected, saying the child should only spend time with ""her mother"" on Mother's Day and called the author ""a bad person"" for including the child. This seems unnecessarily harsh and controlling.

When the author accommodated this by agreeing to go alone, the partner then completely contradicted themselves by demanding they all spend Mother's Day together as a family and accused the author of ""ruining"" the day by leaving.

The partner's behavior shows several problematic patterns:

The author has a legitimate need for physical affection due to their ""Skin Hunger"" condition, which affects their mental and emotional wellbeing. They're clear this isn't sexual - just wanting basic cuddling and physical closeness with romantic partners.

However, there are some concerning patterns here:
- Multiple relationships have ended the same way when they start ""insisting"" on physical affection
- They describe being ""perceived as a toxic element and ejected""
- The word ""insisting"" suggests they may be pressuring partners rather than finding compatible matches
- They seem confused about why partners react negatively, which might indicate poor communication or boundary recognition

The core issue appears to be compatibility and approach rather than the need itself. Some people simply aren't comfortable with high levels of physical affection, and that's valid too. The author may need to:
1. Screen for compatibility earlier in relationships
2. Communicate their needs without pressuring
3. Accept when someone isn't a good match rather than insisting they change

While the author's needs are legitimate, the pattern of multiple failed relationships ending the same way, combined with their own description of ""insisting"" on affection, suggests they may be handling this poorly by trying to force incompatible partners to meet their needs rather than finding naturally compatible ones.

The husband made this decision unilaterally about shared marital property containing both spouses' private information. At minimum, this warranted a discussion first. The proper approach would have been to either:
1. Completely wipe the laptop and do a fresh install
2. Create a guest account with no access to personal files
3. Suggest the employee find an alternative solution

The author is not being paranoid - they're being appropriately cautious about digital privacy and security. The husband acted impulsively without considering the risks or consulting his spouse about their shared private information.

I had a really close friend (Let's call them Joseph) who really got me. When we met, we clicked instantly. We had been through a lot of simi...",Author,Other,0.85,0.7,True,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author clearly established boundaries multiple times - stating they were happy with Toni, didn't want to pursue anything with Joseph, and explicitly told Joseph not to ""hold out"" for them. Despite this, Joseph escalated physical contact and kissed the author without consent.

The author did engage in conversations about ""what could've been"" and allowed some physical closeness (arm around shoulder, hand holding), which sent mixed signals. However, these actions don't justify Joseph crossing the clear boundary that was set.

Key factors:
- The author verbally established clear boundaries about not pursuing a relationship
- Joseph ignored these boundaries and kissed the author without consent
- The author immediately pulled away, showing the kiss was unwanted
- The author was honest with their partner Toni about what happened
- Joseph had a pattern of problematic behavior (mentioned history)

While the author could have been more careful about mixed signals, Joseph is primarily at fault for disrespecting clearly stated boundaries and initiating unwanted physical contact. The author's immediate negative reaction and honesty with their partner shows they recognized this was wrong.

The author called out sick on Friday due to legitimate medical issues (ovarian cyst pain, nausea, and vomiting from medication). They communicated with their boss appropriately by texting about the absence.

The boss is now requesting a doctor's note, but the author states they haven't seen this requirement in company policy and didn't actually visit a doctor (which is reasonable since they were managing a known condition at home).

Key considerations:
- The author had a legitimate medical reason for the absence
- They communicated appropriately with their supervisor
- They claim no policy exists requiring doctor's notes
- It's reasonable to manage known medical conditions at home without seeing a doctor
- Many workplaces do have doctor's note policies, even if not clearly communicated

The main issue seems to be unclear workplace policies rather than wrongdoing by either party. The author acted reasonably given their understanding of the rules, and the boss may be following standard HR practices. However, without knowing the actual company policy or employment laws in their jurisdiction, it's difficult to determine if anyone is truly at fault.

This appears to be more of a policy clarification issue than a fault-based conflict.

The author has legitimate concerns about their roommate's girlfriend's behavior. While mental health struggles are real and valid, the girlfriend's actions go beyond just struggling with anxiety and depression:

1. She's been avoiding treatment for over a year despite offers of help
2. She's physically abusive (hitting and kicking her boyfriend)
3. She's making no effort toward independence or recovery
4. She's manipulating the social situation by spreading negative stories about the author
5. She's creating a completely dependent relationship where her boyfriend does everything for her

The author approached this thoughtfully - they waited months before expressing concern, offered practical help, and drew from their own experience with serious mental illness. The author recognizes that mental health issues require treatment and effort, not just enabling behavior.

The boyfriend enables this behavior but seems to be in an abusive relationship himself. The girlfriend is using her mental health as justification for abusive and manipulative behavior while refusing help and treatment.

Mental illness explains behavior but doesn't excuse abuse or justify refusing all help while demanding others take care of everything. The author was right to express concern about what appears to be an abusive, manipulative situation.

The girlfriend's father was clearly unreasonable and abusive in his response - yelling, calling you a ""motherfucker,"" throwing food out the window, and abandoning you on the side of the road. This was a massive overreaction to eating a single fry.

However, you did directly disobey a clear instruction not to eat in the truck. While this was a minor transgression, it was still deliberate disobedience. More importantly, your action of sneaking the fry while he was checking his mirror created a distraction that contributed to the near-accident situation.

The father's behavior was abusive and completely disproportionate to your minor rule-breaking. But your deliberate disobedience, while understandable given you were hungry, did set off this chain of events and contributed to a dangerous driving situation.

I haven't changed...",Other,Other,0.8,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author received instructions from their mother to ""not post anything on social media"" after their grandfather's death. This instruction was ambiguous - it could reasonably be interpreted as either ""don't post anything about grandfather specifically"" or ""don't post anything at all during this mourning period.""

The author interpreted it as the former and changed their profile pictures (something they hadn't done in years) without any captions or connection to the grandfather. When criticized, they immediately apologized and explained their interpretation.

The family members' reaction seems disproportionate to what was clearly an innocent misunderstanding. While different families have varying mourning customs, expecting someone to completely avoid all social media activity (including routine profile updates) isn't universally understood, especially when the original instruction was vague.

The author showed good faith by:
- Immediately apologizing when the misunderstanding was revealed
- Explaining their reasonable interpretation
- Showing genuine concern about whether they did something wrong

The family could have handled this more gracefully by recognizing it was a miscommunication rather than treating it as intentional disrespect.

This appears to be a case where clearer communication initially would have prevented the issue entirely, and the family's harsh reaction to an honest mistake seems unreasonable.

The author is a college freshman trying to balance academic responsibilities with supporting their girlfriend who had a difficult day. They offered to call later that night rather than immediately, which shows they weren't dismissing her needs entirely - just asking to postpone the conversation.

Key considerations:
- The author has legitimate academic responsibilities that require focus
- They offered an alternative time to talk (later that night)
- They clearly care about their girlfriend and feel conflicted about the situation
- Setting boundaries around study time is healthy and necessary for academic success
- The girlfriend having a bad day doesn't create an obligation for immediate availability

The author is experiencing normal guilt that comes with balancing competing priorities, but their actions were reasonable. They didn't ignore their girlfriend or refuse to talk - they just requested to finish their academic work first. This is a healthy boundary, not neglect.

The girlfriend also isn't at fault for wanting support after a bad day, though the expectation of immediate availability could be unrealistic.

May had valid reasons (problems at home) but failed to communicate this, leaving the author without context for her refusal. A simple ""I'm not feeling up to it today"" would have likely resolved this.

Both parties contributed to this conflict: the author through inappropriate escalation and public shaming, and May through poor communication that left everyone in an awkward position.

This appears to be a normal family dynamic where a teenager is naturally seeking more independence and wanting to spend time with peers rather than parents. The dad wants to spend time with his child, which is a positive parenting behavior. The teenager wants to see the movie with friends instead, which is also completely normal developmental behavior for a 15-year-old.

Neither party is doing anything wrong here:
- The dad is trying to maintain a relationship and share an activity with his child
- The teenager is expressing age-appropriate desires for independence and peer socialization
- No one is being unreasonable, manipulative, or harmful

This is simply a common family situation that requires communication and potentially compromise. The teenager could explain their feelings respectfully, and they might find solutions like seeing the movie with friends but doing another activity with dad, or finding a different movie they'd both enjoy seeing together.

This is a normal part of growing up and family relationships evolving as children become more independent.

The author was subjected to months of relentless pressure from multiple people trying to force him to admit feelings he didn't have. This kind of sustained social pressure can be genuinely distressing and manipulative. However, when he finally gave in and told his friend he had a crush on her, he created a situation where she developed expectations based on what he knew wasn't genuine.

The friend and others were clearly inappropriate in their sustained pressure campaign - repeatedly asking someone about romantic feelings after being told ""no"" multiple times crosses boundaries. But the friend's hurt reaction upon being told it was all a mistake is understandable, even if her calling him ""weak"" was harsh.

The author made a significant error in judgment by giving in to pressure and making a false declaration of romantic interest. He should have held firm in his boundaries or found other ways to handle the pressure. However, he did try to be honest afterward and attempted to explain his reasoning, showing some accountability.

While the author bears responsibility for the immediate harm caused by his false declaration, the sustained pressure campaign that led to this situation was initiated and maintained by others.

The girlfriend made a mistake by reorganizing the author's room without permission a month ago. When she finally apologized, she kept adding qualifiers like ""but you didn't notice"" and ""but you should've told me not to"" - these aren't genuine apologies as they shift blame back to the author.

However, the author's response seems disproportionate. After she left, he called her back specifically to demand she apologize again ""without adding a reason I'm also at fault."" When she returned and tried to apologize, he asked her to go upstairs and do it again. This pattern of repeatedly demanding apologies and not accepting her attempts suggests he was being controlling and punitive rather than seeking genuine resolution.

The girlfriend's frustration is understandable - she did try to apologize multiple times and offered to fix the situation by reorganizing again. While calling him names wasn't ideal, her reaction seems like a response to feeling trapped in an impossible situation where no apology would be accepted.

The author appears to be more focused on getting the ""perfect"" apology and asserting control over how she should apologize, rather than actually resolving the underlying issue. This behavior crosses into being unreasonable and controlling.

The friend's behavior appears to be attention-seeking and potentially performative, which is understandably frustrating. However, the core issue here is how the author wants to respond.

The friend is:
- Making loud, inappropriate sexual comments in public spaces
- Interrupting conversations with repetitive phrases
- Acting in ways that seem performative around gender/sexuality

However, the author's proposed response - telling someone they ""make the LGBT community look bad"" - is problematic because:
1. No individual represents an entire community
2. This kind of policing can be harmful and gatekeeping
3. It doesn't address the actual behavioral issues (being loud, inappropriate, attention-seeking)
4. The friend might be genuinely exploring their identity, even if awkwardly

The real issues are about inappropriate public behavior and being a poor friend (interrupting, making others uncomfortable), not about how they express their LGBT identity. The author would be better served addressing the specific behavioral problems or simply distancing themselves if the friendship isn't working.

While the friend's behavior is annoying and inappropriate, telling someone they make their entire community ""look bad"" crosses a line into harmful territory.

The husband made a clear commitment to make dinner, then got absorbed in his hobby and failed to follow through. When someone offers to do something and you accept that offer, it creates a reasonable expectation. The author waited until 8:40 PM (well past normal dinner time) before taking alternative action, showing considerable patience.

The author's approach was actually quite considerate - rather than interrupting someone who was clearly enjoying their hobby, they took initiative to solve the problem themselves. This shows respect for their partner's autonomy and enjoyment.

The husband's reaction was problematic in multiple ways:
- He failed to manage his time or communicate about delays
- He berated the author for not demanding dinner (essentially blaming them for his own failure to follow through)
- He was ""surprised"" that there was an expected timeframe for dinner, which seems unreasonable given that most people expect dinner around a normal time
- He criticized the author's tone while they were actually being accommodating

The author's belief that it would be rude to demand completion of an offered favor is reasonable and shows good relationship dynamics. The husband's expectation that his partner should have to demand he fulfill his own promises shifts responsibility inappropriately.

The author witnessed what appears to be a significant injustice - his girlfriend falsely accused an innocent man of both causing an accident and making racist statements that the author confirms never happened. This resulted in serious consequences for the elderly man: a ticket, being found at fault, insurance premium increases, and potentially losing his driving privileges.

The author had direct knowledge that could have prevented this injustice but chose to remain silent. While I understand the difficult position of potentially contradicting one's girlfriend in front of police, the moral obligation to prevent serious harm to an innocent person should take precedence over personal discomfort or relationship concerns.

The girlfriend is clearly more at fault for making false accusations, but the author bears responsibility for enabling this injustice through his silence. His own description of being ""spineless"" and the fact that he's ""literally sleepless"" over this suggests he recognizes his moral failing.

However, the author does show genuine remorse and is questioning his relationship over his girlfriend's lack of remorse, which indicates some moral awareness, even if it came too late to help the victim.

You describe feeling increasingly isolated as your friend group dynamics shifted. Molly began focusing heavily on social media friends and then formed a close bond with Mimi. Your other friends also gravitated toward Mimi, and the group developed shared interests (volleyball) that you don't enjoy. This led to you being excluded from outings and feeling ignored.

However, some key points stand out:
- You admit to ""starting to hate Molly"" simply because she talked about making new friends
- You acknowledge having ""nothing in common"" with your friends regarding their interests
- You chose to passively sit out activities rather than communicate your feelings or try to engage
- You've been planning to leave the group for months but keep delaying due to birthdays and events
- You haven't attempted to have honest conversations about feeling excluded

While your friends could have been more inclusive and sensitive, the core issues seem to stem from natural friendship evolution, differing interests, and your own withdrawal from the group. Your growing resentment toward Molly for making new friends and your passive approach to the situation contributed significantly to the current dynamic.

Her family dislikes her boyfriend primarily because he doesn't follow old-fashioned dating customs (not picking her up, not always paying for dates).

The family appears to be imposing their values on a relationship that seems to be working well for both people involved.

The author is dealing with a legitimate concern based on past relationship trauma, but her proposed response is problematic. She wants to deliberately deceive her boyfriend by withholding intimacy and changing her appearance under false pretenses to ""test"" him, rather than having an honest conversation about what his friend told her.

While her insecurity is understandable given her history, testing a partner through deception is manipulative and unfair. It denies him the opportunity to address the concern directly and creates a dishonest dynamic in the relationship. The friend's motives are also questionable - he barely knows her but chose to share potentially relationship-damaging information.

However, the boyfriend would bear significant fault if he is actually objectifying her and bragging about their intimate life to others, which would be a serious violation of trust and respect.

The author should communicate openly about her concerns rather than resort to deceptive testing. If she can't trust him enough for that conversation, the relationship may not be viable regardless.

The author is asking their boyfriend not to go on a trip unless they can also be included. Let me consider the key factors:

1. **The relationship context**: They've been together for 3 years, which is a significant relationship length where inclusion in friend groups becomes more expected.

2. **Past inclusion**: The author was invited the first year but couldn't attend due to work constraints - this shows the friends were initially welcoming.

3. **Current exclusion**: The friends are now saying there's no room, but they'll see if anyone backs out. This suggests the author isn't a priority for inclusion.

The author isn't being unreasonable by expressing hurt feelings about being excluded from a group vacation after 3 years together, nor by setting a boundary about their comfort level with their partner attending without them.

The core issue is that your group consistently excludes one person from lunch outings, leaving them to eat alone. While the friend with the 5-seat car has the right to choose his passengers, the group as a whole is participating in deliberate social exclusion.

You acknowledge you could solve this problem by using your 6-seat SUV, but choose not to because of gas costs and because you don't want to ask for gas money when your friend doesn't. However, the cost of gas for occasional lunch trips is relatively minor compared to the social harm being caused.

The excluded student may have ""inserted himself"" into the group, but after 3 months and your acknowledgment that you're ""okay with him sitting there,"" he's become part of your social circle. The reasoning that you don't share interests isn't particularly compelling - many friend groups have diverse interests.

While your friend with the car bears primary responsibility for the exclusion policy, you and the rest of the group are enabling this behavior by going along with it. You specifically have the means to include everyone but choose convenience and minor cost savings over basic kindness.

The excluded student hasn't done anything wrong - seeking friendship and social connection is normal teenage behavior.

The author made a joke about Bob's financial situation based on Bob's own pattern of using money as an excuse. In the context of this friend group where ""nothing seems to be off limits"" and they ""rip on each other constantly,"" this type of comment would normally be acceptable banter.

However, Bob's reaction revealed that money is actually a sensitive topic for him, despite his participation in the group's usual offensive humor. When Bob said ""money just isn't something we joke about because we all come from different financial situations,"" he established a boundary that the author wasn't previously aware of.

The key factors here:
- The author was operating within the established group dynamic of constant ribbing
- The joke was based on Bob's own stated excuses, making it seem fair game
- Bob had never communicated that finances were off-limits before
- The author was ironically the one actually concerned about money in this specific situation
- The author apologized when they realized they had crossed a line

While the author's comment did cause hurt, it was made without knowledge of Bob's sensitivity about the topic and within the context of their group's normal behavior patterns.

The author describes feeling ""trapped"" by a coworker who has attached to them, expresses affection daily, and reacts poorly when boundaries are set.

The coworker is crossing professional boundaries by declaring them ""BFF's"" without consent, expressing love daily in a workplace setting, and having disruptive emotional reactions when boundaries are attempted. This behavior creates an uncomfortable work environment.

Both parties are contributing to this dysfunctional dynamic - the coworker through inappropriate boundary-crossing and disruptive reactions, and the author through passive communication and failure to address the situation properly with clear, consistent boundaries or involve management if needed.

The author is experiencing jealousy and insecurity about his girlfriend's relationship with her ex. While these feelings are understandable given the circumstances, his response crosses important boundaries:

**Author's problematic behavior:**
- Asking his girlfriend to stop talking to and hugging her ex-boyfriend entirely
- Demanding to see private text messages between her and her friend
- Not trusting her repeated assurances about her feelings
- Trying to control who she can interact with and how

**Girlfriend's concerning behavior:**
- Comparing the author unfavorably to her ex (""he wouldn't make her feel insecure about her body"")
- Initially offering her password then withdrawing it, creating mixed signals
- Repeatedly bringing up missing her ex

**However, the core issue is trust and control.** The author is asking his girlfriend to cut off a friendship and demanding access to private communications. Even if his suspicions were justified, attempting to control a partner's friendships and invade their privacy are unhealthy relationship behaviors. Trust cannot be built through surveillance and control.

The girlfriend has the right to maintain friendships and privacy in her communications, even with an ex-partner, as long as appropriate boundaries are maintained.

**Xavier's actions:**
- Unsolicited sharing of intimate photos of someone he was pursuing
- Asking you to keep it secret from Rauol
- Later blaming you entirely when consequences arose
- Calling you names and making you the scapegoat

**Your actions:**
- Initially keeping the secret as requested
- Sharing the photo with mutual friends (breaking trust)
- Not bringing it up again socially
- Taking responsibility and apologizing when confronted

**The core issue:** Xavier created this entire mess by sharing intimate photos without the woman's knowledge/consent and asking you to keep secrets. While you shouldn't have shown the photo to others, Xavier is fundamentally responsible for:
1. The inappropriate sharing in the first place
2. Creating a situation built on deception
3. Making you complicit in his poor judgment
4. Refusing to take accountability when it backfired

You made an error in judgment by showing the photo to friends, but Xavier's behavior was the root cause - he shared intimate photos inappropriately, involved you in deception, and then blamed you entirely when his actions had predictable consequences. His reaction of calling you names and making you the sole villain shows he's not taking responsibility for his own poor choices.

The woman's privacy was violated primarily by Xavier's initial decision to share her photos, not by your secondary sharing with mutual friends.

The author discovered their wife was communicating with someone she had previously developed ""serious feelings"" for, despite saying she wouldn't contact this person again. The author then took unilateral action by blocking the person's number without telling their wife.

Key considerations:
- The wife broke her word about not contacting this person, which is a breach of trust
- The author took a controlling action (blocking someone's number) without communication
- Both parties are handling this relationship issue poorly - the wife through deception, the author through control rather than direct communication
- The underlying issue (the wife's emotional connection to another person and continued contact) remains unaddressed

The wife is at fault for breaking her promise and continuing contact secretly. However, the author is also at fault for responding with controlling behavior rather than having an honest conversation about the trust issues. Both are avoiding the real problem and handling it in ways that damage the relationship further.

This appears to be a situation where both parties have contributed to the dysfunction through poor communication and broken trust.

The author is grappling with a genuinely difficult decision about having biological children due to genetic risk. This involves weighing their desire for children against potential suffering those children might experience. The author shows care for both their partner and potential future children.

However, there are some concerning aspects to the author's approach:

1. **Inconsistent logic**: They're worried about passing on genetic disease but refuse adoption because they want children to be ""related"" - this suggests the genetic connection matters more to them than they're admitting.

2. **Unilateral decision-making**: They seem to have made this decision and presented it to their partner rather than working through it together as a team.

3. **Lack of medical consultation**: There's no mention of genetic counseling or medical advice to understand actual risks and options.

4. **Dismissal of partner's feelings**: While the partner's upset reaction is understandable, the author doesn't seem to fully grasp how devastating this would be for someone who dreams of having children.

The partner's strong emotional reaction is completely understandable given that their life dreams are being affected by something beyond their control.

This appears to be a case where both people have legitimate concerns and feelings, but the author's approach to handling this sensitive situation could have been much better. The core dilemma isn't necessarily wrong to consider, but the execution shows some insensitivity.

The author has been in a relationship for just over 4 months. His girlfriend has repeatedly pushed for immediate marriage - first suggesting a Vegas elopement after only 1 month of dating, and now proposing marriage during an upcoming vacation. The author has consistently expressed that while he loves her and wants to marry her eventually, he believes they should take more time, move in together first, and plan a proper wedding.

The author's position is reasonable and mature. Four months is an extremely short time to know someone well enough for marriage, and his desire to live together first and plan properly shows thoughtful consideration. He's not rejecting marriage entirely - he's asking for reasonable time and steps.

The girlfriend's behavior is concerning. Pushing for marriage after only one month of dating, then giving the silent treatment when her timeline isn't accepted, suggests she may be more focused on the idea of being married than on building a solid foundation for marriage. Her reaction of shutting down communication when she doesn't get her way is manipulative.

The author has been honest, loving, and reasonable in his responses. He's not at fault for wanting to take a sensible approach to such a major life decision.

The author is repeatedly discussing his ex-wife's appearance, spending habits, and parenting decisions with his girlfriend, despite her clear discomfort. While it's natural for parents to be concerned about their children's welfare, there are several concerning elements here:

1. **Obsessive focus on the ex**: Monitoring and critiquing the ex-wife's personal appearance, clothing, and car purchases goes beyond legitimate child welfare concerns
2. **Ignoring partner's boundaries**: The girlfriend has clearly expressed that she doesn't want to hear these complaints anymore, but the author dismisses her feelings
3. **Inappropriate expectations**: Expecting a romantic partner to serve as a constant sounding board for grievances about an ex-spouse is unreasonable
4. **Misplaced priorities**: While children should be a priority, using a romantic relationship primarily as a venue to vent about an ex-wife is problematic

The girlfriend's ultimatum may seem harsh, but it appears to be a last resort after her previous requests to stop were ignored. She's not asking him to stop caring about his children - she's asking him to stop the constant negative commentary about his ex-wife.

The author made two key mistakes:
1. **The initial ""joke""** - Liking someone's photo on his sister's Instagram account without permission was a boundary violation. Even though it was quickly unliked, this kind of action on someone's social media can have real consequences for their relationships and how they're perceived by others.

2. **Dismissing her feelings** - When his sister expressed that she was upset, instead of acknowledging her concerns and apologizing, he told her she was ""overreacting."" This invalidated her legitimate feelings about having her social media account used without consent.

The sister's anger seems proportionate to the violations. Having someone use your social media account without permission, especially in a romantic context, is genuinely problematic. Her continued frustration makes sense given that the author initially dismissed rather than validated her concerns.

While the author did eventually apologize, it came after he had already doubled down by calling her reaction an overreaction. The damage was compounded by his initial refusal to take responsibility.

The sister's response - being upset about both the original action and the dismissal of her feelings - appears reasonable and justified.

The author received intimate images that were shared consensually during the relationship for mutual enjoyment while they were apart. However, now that the relationship has ended, Amanda has explicitly requested that he delete these images and expressed discomfort with him keeping them.

While the author states he won't share or misuse the images, the key issue here is consent. Consent to share intimate images during a relationship doesn't automatically extend to keeping them indefinitely after the relationship ends. When someone explicitly asks for their intimate images to be deleted, continuing to keep them for ""personal enjoyment"" violates their current consent and autonomy over their own intimate imagery.

The author's reasoning that ""she'd already seen me naked"" misses the fundamental point - this isn't about what someone has already seen, but about ongoing consent to possess intimate images. Amanda has clearly withdrawn her consent for him to have these images.

The ethical approach would be to respect Amanda's explicit request to delete the images. Keeping them against her wishes, even without malicious intent, disregards her autonomy and current boundaries regarding her intimate imagery.

The author has a rescue dog with known behavioral issues and aggression triggers, particularly when frustrated or overwhelmed by unwanted interaction. The cousin with Down syndrome is engaging in multiple behaviors that could trigger the dog - forcing commands, rough play, picking up the dog, disturbing sleep, and not respecting the dog's space.

The author recognizes this is problematic for their dog's wellbeing and training progress, but hasn't communicated these concerns to anyone present. While they're being considerate of the cousin's disability, they have a responsibility as the dog owner to advocate for their pet's safety and the safety of others.

The boyfriend and other family members seem unaware of the situation's potential danger, but they also haven't been informed by the author about the dog's specific triggers and needs.

The cousin's behavior, while well-intentioned, is inappropriate for interacting with any dog, especially one with known issues. However, their disability may affect their ability to understand proper boundaries without clear guidance.

This appears to be a situation where the author needs to speak up to prevent potential harm to both the dog and the cousin, but their failure to communicate so far doesn't make them fully at fault - they're trying to navigate a sensitive situation.

The author clearly expressed strong interest in this person from the very beginning and communicated their feelings openly to their friend M. M initially claimed she wasn't interested and knew how much the author liked him.

However, the author's approach became problematic when they:
- Tried to control who M could add on social media and talk to
- Made ultimatums about the friendship based on M's personal choices
- Essentially demanded M choose between a potential romantic interest and their friendship

While M's behavior wasn't ideal (claiming disinterest then changing her mind, continuing contact despite knowing it hurt the author), she ultimately has the right to pursue her own romantic interests, even if the timing and approach could have been more considerate.

The author's possessive behavior over someone they weren't even in a relationship with, combined with trying to control their friend's actions and issuing ultimatums, crosses into problematic territory. You can't claim exclusive rights to someone you've never dated, nor should you try to dictate your friend's romantic choices through emotional manipulation.

Both parties handled this poorly, but the author's controlling behavior and ultimatum-giving is the more significant issue here.

**The legal reality**: You're correct that you have no legal obligation since you're not on the lease. Your ex took on that legal responsibility alone.

**The moral consideration**: You both made the decision to move in together and split costs, creating a reasonable expectation that you'd both contribute for the agreed period. While she initiated the breakup, that doesn't automatically release you from the financial arrangement you both entered into.

**The practical factors**: Your ex does have income ($23/hour), a full ride scholarship, and family support, which means she has resources to manage this situation, even if it's financially challenging.

**Your mother's perspective**: While legally accurate, the ""you owe nothing as just a friend"" argument ignores that you made this commitment as partners and the breakup doesn't erase the practical consequences of your joint decision.

**Your willingness to help**: The fact that you're considering paying your share despite no legal obligation shows good character and recognition of the shared responsibility.

The most ethical approach would be to contribute something, even if not the full amount for the entire remaining lease period. You both created this situation together, and leaving her with 100% of the financial burden when you have the means to help feels unfair, regardless of who initiated the breakup.

The author made a comment about their coworker's weight (""put all your 95 pounds into it"") in what seems intended as workplace banter or encouragement. However, this comment directly targeted a physical characteristic that the coworker is clearly sensitive about.

The lead tech's response, while harsh and retaliatory, was a defensive reaction to being ""picked on"" about his size - something the other coworker confirmed makes him uncomfortable.

The key issue here is that the author initiated the exchange by commenting on someone's physical appearance/weight, even if meant lightheartedly. In a professional workplace, making comments about coworkers' bodies or physical characteristics is generally inappropriate, regardless of intent. The fact that this person is described as being sensitive about being ""picked on for being scrawny"" suggests this may not have been the first such comment.

While the lead tech's response was also inappropriate and escalated the situation, it was reactive rather than initiating. The author created the hostile dynamic by making the initial comment about physical appearance.

The father's response seems disproportionate and problematic. He:
- Made contradictory statements (""doesn't care about why we obey"" vs ""I care that you care about the why"")

The mother-in-law placed a 10-week-old puppy on the ground near a French bulldog with known severe food aggression, with food present. This was an extremely poor decision that directly led to the attack. The sister-in-law owns a dog with known aggressive tendencies but apparently hasn't taken adequate precautions or provided proper training/management.

- Performative sadness only when staff were present
- Making the author feel guilty about family rifts and vet bills
- The sister-in-law's girlfriend's ""apology"" that blamed the author for being angry

The author's responses (calling the dog a ""monster,"" refusing babysitting offers, being angry) are completely reasonable given that their puppy nearly died due to others' negligence and poor judgment.

2. **Sharing the plan**: While perhaps not strategically wise to announce flipping intentions, this wasn't malicious or harmful to anyone.

3. **The Discord member's response**: Calling someone's legitimate business activity ""despicable and disgusting"" is an extreme overreaction that caused significant emotional harm to a 17-year-old who was simply trying to make some money.

4. **The author's self-blame**: The author is being far too harsh on themselves, taking on guilt for something that isn't actually wrong.

Sexual and romantic attraction isn't something people can simply will themselves to feel or not feel. The author appears to be handling this difficult situation with as much care and respect as possible given the circumstances.

The partner, while having every right to transition, failed to communicate about starting hormone therapy for months, which is a significant relationship issue regardless of the context.

The author is a 21-year-old adult who will be temporarily living with his mother. He's planning to hide his money by converting it to cash so he can mislead her about his financial situation when she asks.

Key considerations:
- As an adult, he has a right to financial privacy

- The mother appears to be asking about his finances not just for household contributions, but to take ""a chunk of it""
- He's temporarily staying there and has legitimate future expenses (moving abroad)
- However, he's choosing deception rather than honest communication

While the author has valid concerns about financial boundaries and his mother may be overstepping by expecting access to his savings beyond reasonable household contributions, deliberately hiding money and planning to lie when directly asked crosses into deceptive territory. A more appropriate approach would be having an honest conversation about boundaries - he could acknowledge he'll contribute fairly to household expenses while keeping his savings private for his upcoming move.

The author made an initial comment about their friend not eating much, which while perhaps unnecessary, seems to have been intended as light-hearted concern. However, the friend's response escalated dramatically - she launched into a lengthy critique calling the author's eating habits ""gross,"" saying three meals a day is ""way too much,"" and essentially calling her a glutton.

The author then responded by pointing out the apparent contradiction between the friend's criticism and their relative body sizes. While this was hurtful, it was a direct response to being called a glutton and having her eating habits criticized as ""gross.""

The key issue here is proportionality. The author made one comment about the friend's eating, but the friend responded with an extended attack on the author's character and eating habits. The author's retort, while mean, was reactive rather than initiating the personal attacks.

Additionally, there's concerning context about the friend's eating patterns - barely eating anything over two days despite being active, declining food repeatedly, and having extreme reactions to normal portion sizes. This suggests possible disordered eating, which doesn't excuse the harsh criticism but provides context.

The author heard rumors from multiple classmates that his girlfriend kissed another person during a school trip.

His approach was measured - he asked open-ended questions first (""Do you have anything to say to me?"" and ""What happened during the schooltrip?"") before directly addressing the specific rumor.

When confronted with healthy communication in a relationship, his girlfriend became defensive and emotional rather than simply clarifying what happened. The author discovered the rumors were false, but his decision to address them directly was reasonable given:

2. He had some pre-existing mild concerns about the flirtatious dynamic between his girlfriend and this friend
3. He approached the conversation seeking clarification, not making accusations
4. Open communication about concerns is fundamental to healthy relationships

The girlfriend's reaction - immediately becoming defensive and tearful rather than simply explaining the misunderstanding - suggests she may have overreacted to what was a reasonable request for clarification about concerning rumors.

The author has some reasonable expectations (wanting to be informed about plans, not wanting detailed drunk texts about people hitting on his girlfriend) but also shows concerning patterns. He admits to having trust issues and seems to be monitoring his girlfriend's activities quite closely. The girlfriend appears to be somewhat inconsistent in her communication - sometimes telling him about plans, sometimes not, and sending inappropriate drunk texts.

However, the core issue seems to be a mismatch in communication styles and expectations rather than anyone being deliberately malicious. The author wants more communication and transparency, while the girlfriend may feel this is controlling. Her drunk texts about people hitting on her are inappropriate and would make most partners uncomfortable, but her defensive reaction suggests she may not realize the impact.

The author hasn't confronted her yet and is seeking advice first, which shows some self-awareness. Neither person seems to be communicating their needs clearly to the other.

This appears to be a case where both people have valid concerns but are handling the situation poorly - the author by not directly addressing his needs, and the girlfriend by being inconsistent in communication and sending inappropriate messages.

The author has a legitimate grievance about unequal treatment - one member gets early access while others, including a 20-year member, are denied the same privilege. This creates an unfair two-tiered system that understandably causes frustration.

However, the author's reasoning about the manager talking behind their back is problematic. They're making assumptions based on indirect evidence - the fact that another gym member ""didn't want to get involved"" doesn't necessarily mean the conversation was about the author. People avoid workplace drama for many reasons, and this could have been about any number of topics.

The manager appears to be showing favoritism, which is poor management practice, even if there are safety concerns that could potentially justify the early access policy.

The author's upset feelings about the unequal treatment are completely justified, but their assumption about being talked about behind their back seems to be based on speculation rather than concrete evidence.

Since the core issue (unequal gym access) represents legitimate unfair treatment by the manager, but the author is making unfounded assumptions about gossip, this involves fault on both sides.

The author is dealing with serious health issues (cancer remission, multiple surgeries, compromised immune system) and is under pressure from her husband to find work despite these challenges. She's actively job searching as requested, even though she suggested waiting until they move closer to the city for better reliability.

When she sits down to fill out a job application - something her husband has been pushing her to do - he decides to repeatedly play a loud, annoying meme song while she's trying to concentrate. She had already mentioned having sensory overload issues that day, making this particularly disruptive.

The husband's behavior shows a clear lack of consideration:
- He's been pressuring her to find work
- When she's actually doing the work of job searching, he creates a disruptive environment
- He dismisses her reasonable request for quiet by suggesting she should just leave
- He frames his inconsiderate behavior as just wanting ""a fun moment""

The author's response was proportionate - she first tried to cope silently with headphones, then expressed frustration when the disruption continued. Her tone may have been harsh, but this appears to be part of an ongoing pattern of inconsiderate behavior from her husband.

The husband is clearly at fault for being disruptive and inconsiderate, especially given the circumstances and his own demands for her to find work.

The author has been consistently thoughtful and generous with others' birthdays for years, going above and beyond with cakes, cards, dinners, and meaningful gestures. They've set a clear standard of care and celebration within their family relationships.

In return, they've received minimal acknowledgment - just verbal ""happy birthday"" wishes from siblings, complete forgetfulness from parents, and even their fiancé forgot until reminded by his sister. The author has had cereal for birthday dinner two years running and received no cakes or special gestures.

The author is questioning whether they're being selfish for wanting reciprocal care and consideration. However, wanting basic acknowledgment and some effort on your birthday - especially when you consistently provide that for others - is completely reasonable. The desire for a cake or special meal isn't excessive; it's a normal expectation of care from close family and a romantic partner.

The family members and fiancé are taking the author's generosity for granted while failing to show basic consideration in return. The parents forgetting entirely and just saying ""sorry, forgot the cake"" while returning to TV is particularly dismissive. The fiancé's oversight is especially concerning given their intimate relationship.

The author isn't being a ""brat"" or ""asshole"" - they're experiencing legitimate hurt from a pattern of one-sided emotional labor and lack of reciprocal care from people who should value them.

The author's girlfriend has experienced severe trauma - abuse, sexual assault, death of parents, suicide attempts, and ongoing mental health struggles. These are serious issues that understandably affect how she processes and responds to everyday conversations.

However, the pattern described shows the girlfriend consistently responding to the author's positive comments or normal experiences by immediately redirecting to her own trauma in a way that shuts down the conversation. While her pain is valid, using it to consistently diminish others' experiences or excitement creates an unhealthy dynamic.

The author has been patient, supportive, and understanding for what seems like an extended period. They're not dismissing her trauma or asking her to ""get over it"" - they're expressing frustration with a specific communication pattern that makes normal conversation difficult.

The girlfriend may not realize she's doing this, as trauma can create patterns where everything gets filtered through that lens. But impact matters alongside intent.

The author's feelings of frustration are valid - being in a relationship where you can't express normal emotions or excitement without them being consistently overshadowed is emotionally draining. Getting visibly annoyed after what sounds like months or years of this pattern is a human response.

This seems like a situation where both people need support - the girlfriend needs professional help to process her trauma in healthier ways, and they both need to work on communication patterns that allow for mutual support rather than one-sided emotional dumping.

The pact was made during a moment of stress and fear when both friends felt hopeless about their academic futures. It was essentially a mutual support agreement born from shared anxiety rather than a carefully considered life decision.

Since making the pact, circumstances changed significantly - the author improved academically and achieved their dream school acceptance, while the friend's situation deteriorated. The author didn't deliberately abandon their friend or stop caring about them; they simply succeeded academically.

The promise itself was problematic from the start. It essentially asked both parties to limit their potential based on the lowest common denominator of achievement. While made with good intentions during a vulnerable time, it was unrealistic to expect someone to give up their dream school opportunity.

The author's excitement about their acceptance is completely natural and understandable - this is a major life achievement they've worked hard for. The friend's feelings of betrayal, while painful, stem from disappointment in his own situation rather than any malicious action by the author.

The author is trying to balance honoring their commitment with pursuing their rightful opportunity, and they clearly still care about maintaining the friendship. They're not callously abandoning their friend but rather facing the reality that their paths have diverged.

This appears to be a case where circumstances evolved beyond what was anticipated when the promise was made, making it unreasonable to expect the author to sacrifice their future.

The husband appears to have correctly placed the order (receipt shows the special order), so the restaurant error isn't his fault. However, his response to the situation is problematic. When your partner is upset about receiving the wrong food - especially when takeout is a rare treat due to financial constraints - the caring response would be to try to fix it, not dismiss their feelings.

The husband's refusal to return to get the correct order, telling his wife to ""just accept it"" and eat his food instead, shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and needs. His dismissive attitude (""50% of what you ordered should be enough"") minimizes something that was clearly important to her.

The wife's frustration is understandable - she was looking forward to something specific, it's a rare treat for them, and her husband won't make the effort to correct the mistake. However, the situation escalating to shouting and both parties retreating to separate rooms suggests the conflict went beyond what was proportional to the original problem.

While the restaurant made the initial error, the real issue here is how the couple handled the disappointment together. The husband's dismissive attitude and unwillingness to help fix the situation is the primary problem, though both contributed to escalating the conflict unnecessarily.

The author suggested picking up an item, thinking the girlfriend had wanted it. When she corrected him that she didn't want it, he said it wasn't in their way anyway. She then said ""I don't want to go"" - which could reasonably be interpreted as either not wanting to go to that specific location or not wanting to go on the day out at all.

The author responded with ""okie, it was just a suggestion..."" - the ellipsis here does come across as passive-aggressive, suggesting he was hurt or annoyed by her response. This likely made the girlfriend feel like she couldn't express her preferences without him taking it personally.

The girlfriend then escalated by being quite harsh (""so i don't need your dots ty""), and when the author gave a curt ""ok"" response, she continued to push the issue instead of letting it go.

Both parties contributed to turning a minor miscommunication into a conflict. The author used passive-aggressive communication (the ellipsis), and the girlfriend was unnecessarily harsh and kept escalating when she could have moved on to planning other activities.

This appears to be a case where both people handled the situation poorly - the author with passive-aggressive responses and the girlfriend with harsh escalation.

The author and her husband had an established financial arrangement that worked well - he gave her 80% of his paycheck, she handled all bills and expenses, and they split remaining money appropriately while building savings.

The husband unilaterally changed this arrangement, now only giving 45-50% of his paycheck while still expecting the author to pay ALL bills and expenses from her reduced amount. He kept the other 50% for himself but contributes nothing to household expenses.

This creates an impossible mathematical situation - the author cannot pay the same bills with roughly half the money she had before. The husband seems to either not understand or not care that bills are going unpaid and the account is going negative.

The author is simply asking for enough money to fulfill the responsibilities that were agreed upon (paying all household bills and expenses). She's not asking for personal spending money or luxuries - she needs adequate funds to cover basic necessities like utilities and groceries.

The husband is being unreasonable by dramatically reducing the household budget while maintaining the same expectations for bill payment. He's essentially forcing financial stress on the family while keeping more money for his personal use.

The author is not at fault for requesting sufficient funds to manage the household finances that she's responsible for.

You were having a bad mental health day and were hungry, which are understandable stressors. Your girlfriend accidentally left her glasses (something she does often), and then struggled with what you describe as a simple task of locking the door.

However, your response crossed several lines:
- You went upstairs ""angrily"" 
- You ""grabbed the keys from her hand"" in an aggressive manner
- You ""accidentally bumped her with my left shoulder"" - while you say this was accidental, it occurred in the context of angry, aggressive movements
- You slammed the door and spoke condescendingly (""told her that it was that easy"")

Even when stressed, hungry, or having mental health struggles, physical contact during anger (even if ""accidental"") and aggressive behavior toward a partner is not acceptable. Your girlfriend's reaction - refusing to ride with you and shouting - suggests she felt genuinely threatened or hurt by your behavior.

While your feelings of frustration were valid, your actions were disproportionate to the situation. A forgotten pair of glasses and difficulty with a door lock don't justify aggressive physical behavior, even if unintentional.

Your girlfriend may have overreacted by screaming in the street, but this appears to be a response to feeling physically intimidated or hurt.

The author initially gave reasonable feedback about sticking to the agreed plan, since publicly calling out teens can backfire. When S seemed taken aback, the author tried to de-escalate by ending the conversation - a reasonable approach for a minor disagreement.

However, S insisted on meeting to ""finish the conversation"" and then spent 45 minutes trying to get the author to admit she was wrong, going in circles despite the author's attempts to be diplomatic. The author showed patience for nearly an hour before finally expressing frustration that the conversation wasn't productive.

S's behavior shows several problematic patterns:
- Taking reasonable feedback as a ""personal attack""
- Demanding the other person validate her actions
- Refusing to accept that they could agree to disagree
- Labeling the author as ""hurtful"" and ""immature"" for wanting to end an unproductive discussion
- Using manipulative language about ""the right thing to do""

The author tried multiple diplomatic approaches (understanding S's reasoning, saying it wasn't a big deal, attempting to end gracefully) before reaching a breaking point after 45 minutes of circular discussion. Having boundaries about unproductive conversations is healthy, not immature.

S created this conflict by insisting on a meeting to relitigate a resolved issue, then trying to force agreement rather than accepting different perspectives.

- Creates situations and expects the author to ""just deal with it""
- Has allowed someone who ""hates"" the author to move in, making the author feel unsafe

The friend's pattern of creating drama, being manipulative, and dismissing valid concerns about safety shows a consistent disregard for the author's wellbeing.

The author describes a relationship with concerning patterns:

- Controlling behavior (not allowing the author to do things independently)
- The girlfriend becoming angry when the author had activities outside the relationship
- The relationship causing the author to lie to family and engage in inappropriate behaviors
- Family members recognizing the relationship as unhealthy

The author made the decision to end what they recognized as an unhealthy, manipulative relationship after 10 months. This appears to be a reasonable response to manipulative and controlling behavior. Breaking up with someone is not inherently wrong, especially when the relationship involves manipulation and control.

The ex-girlfriend being upset about the breakup is understandable, but this doesn't make the author wrong for ending an unhealthy relationship. Promises to change don't obligate someone to return to a harmful situation.

The author brought their own bed frame and mattress, while the roommates chose to buy a bunk bed together. Since no prior arrangements were made about sleeping arrangements, the current setup developed organically based on what furniture each person contributed.

Key considerations:
- The author owns their bed setup and has legitimate concerns about hygiene/comfort with sharing personal furniture
- No formal agreement was made initially about rotating or sharing sleeping arrangements
- The roommates voluntarily chose to purchase a bunk bed knowing it meant less desirable sleeping positions
- The author's sleep quality concerns (tossing and turning) are valid practical considerations
- All parties seem to be handling this maturely without relationship damage

The author has reasonable grounds to keep their solo bed arrangement since they provided their own furniture and have practical concerns about sharing it. The roommates aren't necessarily wrong for asking, but they also made their choice when purchasing the bunk bed. This appears to be a natural consequence of the furniture decisions made rather than anyone acting unreasonably.

**The Author's perspective:**
- Was sitting at the head of the table for an hour before lunch
- Had valid reasons for choosing that seat (facing the kitchen, able to participate in conversation)
- Asked for clarification when asked to move
- When given no compelling reason, declined to move
- Eventually did move when family intervened

**The Father's perspective:**
- Made a polite initial request
- When declined, escalated to threats (""I will be very angry"")
- Left the room rather than handle the conflict maturely
- As the homeowner, may have felt entitled to choose his seating

**Analysis:**
This appears to be a power struggle that escalated unnecessarily. The father's initial request was reasonable, but when declined, he handled it poorly by making threats rather than either:
1. Explaining why that particular seat mattered to him
2. Accepting that his son was already settled there
3. Finding a mature compromise

The author's refusal wasn't unreasonable given the lack of compelling justification and the fact he was already seated. However, both parties could have handled this more maturely.

The author is facing a genuine moral dilemma between loyalty to their spouse and concern for an innocent person being deceived. While the desire to help Brooke comes from a place of empathy and personal experience with infidelity, there are several important considerations:

1. **Confidentiality breach**: The information came through a chain of confidence (Scott → husband → author), and revealing it would violate that trust.

2. **Relationship consequences**: The husband has clearly stated this would damage their marriage and his ability to trust the author.

3. **Indirect involvement**: The author has no direct relationship with any of the parties involved in the affair.

4. **Potential complications**: Intervening could create workplace drama for the husband, damage multiple relationships, and the author might be blamed as the messenger.

5. **Alternative approaches**: The author could encourage their husband to speak with Scott about coming clean, rather than taking direct action themselves.

While the author's motivations are understandable and compassionate, considering breaking their spouse's explicit trust and potentially damaging their own marriage to intervene in a situation where they're not directly involved crosses ethical boundaries. The ""considering"" aspect suggests they're still weighing options, but the inclination to override their spouse's clear boundary is problematic.

The author and boyfriend were upfront about not being tidy people in their rental posting, and the roommate explicitly agreed she was ""fine with being a little messy"" before moving in. This established clear expectations.

However, there's a difference between what was communicated and what's happening:
- The author admits they ""let the kitchen get messier than usual"" after the roommate moved in
- They're leaving dishes for ""a day or two"" which can accumulate significantly
- The roommate is feeling compelled to clean their messes because it's affecting her living space

The roommate did communicate her concerns (albeit indirectly at first), and the author responded positively initially. But the pattern seems to be continuing where the common areas are getting messy enough that the roommate feels she needs to clean up after them.

While the roommate agreed to ""a little messy,"" there's a reasonable limit to what that means in shared spaces. Leaving dishes for multiple days and letting the kitchen get ""messier than usual"" goes beyond normal clutter. The roommate is paying rent and deserves to use clean common areas.

The author seems to recognize this is problematic (they felt bad and cleaned up when first confronted) but the behavior is continuing, suggesting they may be taking advantage of the roommate's willingness to clean rather than maintaining reasonable standards for shared spaces.

The author is dealing with a very difficult circumstance - his mother-in-law attempted suicide and now requires care, which has disrupted his home life significantly. Let me evaluate his actions and attitudes:

**What the author is doing right:**

The friend's behavior was clearly problematic - he made specific romantic overtures and promises while you were away, built up your expectations, then completely changed course without any explanation when you returned. Even though you weren't officially dating, leading someone on like this and then going silent is hurtful and disrespectful.

You acknowledge he doesn't know why you're upset, yet you're choosing to keep him in the dark while enjoying what you describe as ""nice karma.""

While you're not obligated to maintain a friendship or provide a detailed explanation, completely stonewalling someone who was a long-time friend - especially when they seem genuinely confused - is somewhat harsh. A brief, honest explanation about why you need space would be more appropriate than leaving him to wonder indefinitely.

That said, your hurt feelings are completely valid, and you have every right to protect yourself by limiting contact. The friend bears more responsibility here for creating this situation through his poor communication and misleading behavior.

The author is considering asking their girlfriend to modify her grooming habits for their comfort during oral sex. Key considerations:

**In favor of the author:**
- They maintain extensive grooming themselves, so it's not hypocritical
- They're asking respectfully rather than demanding
- Personal preferences in intimate relationships are valid
- They're considering compromise (trimming vs. full shaving)

**Potential concerns:**
- Body autonomy is important - ultimately it's her choice
- She may have reasons for her current grooming that aren't apparent
- Asking could create pressure or self-consciousness

**Assessment:**
This appears to be a reasonable request between partners. The author:
- Has legitimate practical concerns (hair in mouth during oral sex)
- Maintains similar grooming standards themselves
- Is considering how to ask respectfully rather than demanding
- Is open to compromise solutions

In healthy relationships, partners can discuss preferences and comfort levels around intimacy. The key is how it's communicated - respectfully, without pressure, and accepting whatever decision she makes. The author seems to understand this based on their thoughtful approach.

This doesn't appear to be a fault situation - it's a normal relationship communication issue where both people's comfort and autonomy matter.

The author is expressing legitimate concerns about their mother's behavior affecting family relationships and safety. The mother is:
- Driving with earphones in (dangerous and often illegal)
- Being unavailable for family communication and connection
- Demanding complete silence from family members for recordings
- Responding to concerns with anger, defensiveness, and manipulative statements about wanting to kill herself
- Calling her child names like ""princess"" and ""spoiled"" when they try to communicate

The author has tried multiple approaches - talking directly to their mother, involving their father, and expressing their feelings respectfully. They're worried about the impact on their younger sister and genuinely want to maintain a relationship with their mother.

While the mother may be dealing with her own issues (she mentions hating her life), her responses are inappropriate and harmful to her family. Using threats of self-harm to shut down legitimate concerns is particularly concerning behavior.

The author is not at fault for wanting basic family communication, safety while driving, or the ability to have conversations with their parent. Their concerns are reasonable and their attempts to address the situation have been appropriate.

The mother's obsessive behavior and hostile responses to family concerns make her primarily at fault here.

The author is clearly struggling with depression or a similar mental health issue, which explains the lack of motivation, substance use, and emotional numbness. However, they are also making conscious choices that harm others who care about them:

- Lying to parents about sobriety while they financially support their education
- Taking a spot on the golf team without giving proper effort, potentially affecting teammates
- Not fulfilling responsibilities at their internship
- Deceiving everyone about their true state while accepting their support and investment

While the underlying mental health struggles are not the author's fault, the pattern of deception and taking advantage of others' goodwill while giving nothing back is problematic. The author shows self-awareness about their behavior (""I know I'm doing 'well' but still feel like a huge dick"") but continues the harmful pattern.

The people around them (parents, teammates, employer) appear to be genuinely supportive and invested in the author's success, making them victims of the deception rather than contributors to the problem.

The author needs help, not judgment, but they are still responsible for the choices they're making that hurt others who care about them.

The author is clearly under enormous stress - caring for a wife with brain injury complications, a daughter with depression, working, and now taking on primary care for their mother after a medical procedure. They're geographically the closest sibling and took on the responsibility willingly initially.

However, the author's approach to addressing the lack of help was problematic. Sending ""bitchy emails"" when frustrated, rather than having direct conversations about needs and expectations, is not an effective way to resolve family dynamics. This appears to be a pattern (mentioned doing the same thing years ago about grandmother visits).

The siblings also bear responsibility - they seem to have defaulted to letting the geographically closest person handle everything without offering meaningful support, despite apparently having more resources and less stress. Even if they can't provide hands-on care due to distance, there are other ways to help (financial support, arranging services, regular check-ins, etc.).

The core issue seems to be poor family communication about caregiving responsibilities and expectations. Everyone made assumptions rather than having honest discussions about capacity, needs, and how to share the burden equitably.

While the author's frustration is completely understandable given their circumstances, their method of expressing it was counterproductive and likely damaged relationships further.

The author is grappling with a deeply painful family situation where their brother and sister-in-law, both carriers of Tay-Sachs disease, are expecting another child after already having one child with this devastating condition. The author is considering whether to suggest abortion or vasectomy, knowing this conflicts with the couple's Catholic beliefs.

Key considerations:
- The couple has already made their reproductive choices based on their religious beliefs and values
- They are fully aware of the genetic risks (25% chance of Tay-Sachs, not 50% as the author states)
- Suggesting abortion or sterilization to practicing Catholics would likely be deeply hurtful and offensive
- The couple has the right to make their own reproductive decisions, even if others disagree
- The author's anger and judgment about their ""letting religious beliefs get in the way"" shows a lack of respect for the couple's autonomy

While the author's concern comes from a place of love and genuine worry about suffering, suggesting abortion or vasectomy would be inappropriate interference in deeply personal decisions that the couple has already made based on their values. The author would be overstepping boundaries and potentially damaging family relationships by imposing their own judgment on the couple's reproductive choices.

The couple is not at fault for making reproductive decisions consistent with their beliefs, even if those decisions carry risks.

The author admits to making jokes about their friend being poor, including saying ""you smell like poor!"" The author acknowledges they usually only make such jokes when they're sure the other person knows it's a joke, but they made these jokes anyway despite that uncertainty. The friend was hurt enough by these comments that they cried and their mother had to call the author's grandmother.

The author shows remorse and feels bad about the situation, which suggests they recognize they crossed a line. However, the damage was already done - they made hurtful comments about their friend's economic situation, which is a sensitive topic that can cause real emotional harm.

While the author may not have intended to hurt their friend, they admit they deviated from their usual practice of only making such jokes when they're certain the other person understands it's humor. Making jokes about someone being poor, especially when you're not sure they'll take it as a joke, shows poor judgment and insensitivity.

The friend's reaction (crying) and the parent's involvement indicate this wasn't perceived as harmless joking but as hurtful behavior. The author is responsible for their choice of words and for not being more considerate of their friend's feelings.

You made a comment referencing ""killerbaby bandito"" when seeing your friend wearing a green bandana with an abortion rights symbol during a live stream about a serious political issue. You were referencing Twenty One Pilots' fictional universe where characters called ""banditos"" wear bandanas.

The key issues here:
1. Your friend was participating in advocacy for abortion rights - a deeply serious and personal political issue in your country
2. You made what appears to be a flippant comment combining ""killer"" and ""baby"" while she was wearing abortion rights symbols
3. Even though you intended it as a band reference, the timing and word choice (""killerbaby"") in the context of abortion rights discussion was extremely poor
4. Your friend interpreted this as mocking or making light of an important cause she cares about

While your intention may have been innocent fan reference, you failed to read the room and made an inappropriate comment during a serious moment. However, your friend's response of immediately blocking you and calling you names without giving you a chance to explain or apologize was also quite harsh.

You seem genuinely confused about what went wrong, which suggests this was more thoughtless than malicious.

The author is being asked to house someone who:
- Has active legal troubles and potential criminal charges pending
- Has connections to drug dealing and evidence tampering
- Has a volatile ex-partner with criminal tendencies who might retaliate
- Has a history of meth use and lost her job due to performance issues

The author's concerns are legitimate:
- Protecting his own family and children from potential danger
- Avoiding involvement in ongoing criminal investigations
- Maintaining the safety and stability of his home
- Protecting his and his wife's careers and reputation

The author offered a reasonable compromise - paying for temporary housing elsewhere, which still provides substantial help without exposing his family to risk.

The wife's position, while compassionate, doesn't adequately weigh the serious risks to their own family. Calling the author ""selfish"" for prioritizing his family's safety and well-being seems unfair.

The author has a primary responsibility to protect his own family first. While helping others is admirable, it shouldn't come at the expense of putting one's own children and spouse in potential danger from volatile individuals or legal complications.

The author is expressing disappointment about a significant reduction in their Christmas bonus compared to the previous year (from roughly a full paycheck amount to $30 after taxes). They acknowledge that bonuses aren't obligated and are questioning whether their feelings make them entitled.

Key considerations:
- The author recognizes companies aren't required to give bonuses
- They're simply expressing disappointment about the dramatic decrease
- They verified with a colleague that this wasn't targeted at them specifically
- They're genuinely questioning their own reaction and asking for perspective
- Having expectations based on previous company practices is reasonable
- Feeling disappointed about reduced compensation/recognition is a normal human response

The author isn't demanding anything, threatening to quit, or acting inappropriately. They're processing their feelings about what appears to be a company-wide decision to drastically reduce bonuses. While the company has every right to adjust bonus amounts based on their financial situation, the author also has every right to feel disappointed about it.

This seems like a natural reaction to changed circumstances rather than entitled behavior. The author is being quite self-reflective and reasonable in their approach.

That being s...",Other,Other,0.85,0.9069767441860465,True,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author expressed genuine discomfort about generalized negative statements targeting his identity group. This is a reasonable concern - being told repeatedly that your demographic group is hated, even ""jokingly,"" can feel alienating and hurtful. He handled this maturely by addressing it privately rather than confronting her publicly.

The friend's response was problematic in several ways:
1. She dismissed his feelings entirely
2. She suggested that being offended by anti-male statements implies he's doing something wrong (essentially victim-blaming)
3. She justified her behavior by claiming men as a group ""deserve"" the hate
4. She rejected his analogy about other demographic groups without engaging with the underlying principle

The author's comparison to saying ""I hate women"" or ""I hate Mexicans"" was meant to illustrate how generalizations about demographic groups can be hurtful - this seems like a fair point about consistency in how we treat different groups.

The mutual friends also dismissed the author's concerns rather than trying to understand his perspective.

While the friend may have legitimate frustrations with experiences involving men, expressing this through blanket statements like ""I hate men"" in mixed company, then dismissing a friend's discomfort about it, shows a lack of empathy and consideration.

The author approached this thoughtfully and wasn't demanding she change her entire worldview - just asking for some consideration about how these statements affect him as a friend.

You and your SO have:

2. Not explicitly told them to stop (though your discomfort was apparent)
3. Are now considering cutting contact due to feeling ""super super uncomfortable""

The other couple is clearly crossing boundaries by persistently pursuing sexual scenarios with people who have shown they're not interested. They've escalated their behavior despite obvious signs of discomfort. However, you haven't directly communicated ""please stop this behavior"" - though your discomfort should have been clear enough.

While direct communication would be ideal, the other couple's persistent boundary-pushing behavior after clear signs of discomfort makes them primarily at fault. You're not obligated to endure continued sexual harassment just because you haven't said ""no"" in the most explicit terms possible.

The author and their sister are seeking out potential half-siblings through DNA testing after their abusive father's death. Their mother believes this could harm innocent people, like the girl who may not know her true parentage.

Key considerations:
- The author has legitimate reasons for wanting to connect with biological family, especially after trauma and abandonment
- Their approach has been respectful - the sister asked general questions without revealing potentially damaging details
- The potential half-sibling may indeed be unaware of her true parentage, and learning this information could be disruptive
- However, the author isn't forcing information on anyone or being deceptive
- People generally have a right to seek out biological relatives, and others have a right to decline contact

The mother's concerns are understandable but overly cautious. The author is navigating a complex situation thoughtfully, seeking connection while being mindful of others' feelings. The approach taken so far - making contact but not immediately revealing potentially upsetting details - shows consideration for all parties involved.

The author isn't doing anything wrong by wanting to connect with potential family members, especially given their traumatic history. As long as they continue to respect boundaries and give people the choice of whether to engage, this is a reasonable pursuit.

The author is suggesting his wife look for a new job that could offer better pay and benefits, which seems like a reasonable financial discussion between spouses. However, there are several concerning aspects to consider:

1. The wife has documented medical conditions (fibromyalgia) and mental health challenges (anxiety) that she's sought professional help for
2. She has 10 years of experience in her current field and feels it's what her body can handle
3. The author appears to be dismissing her self-assessment of her limitations and capabilities
4. While the financial logic about staying in his current job makes sense, he's essentially telling someone with chronic illness and anxiety that they need to be the one to make major changes

The wife's defensiveness and insistence that only the author should make changes also seems problematic - partnerships require flexibility from both sides.

However, the author's approach of essentially telling someone with chronic pain and anxiety disorders that they should just find a different job, while he maintains his comfortable position, shows a lack of empathy and understanding of her medical limitations. People with fibromyalgia often struggle with unpredictable symptoms, and those with anxiety disorders may genuinely find job changes extremely difficult.

This appears to be a case where both parties are being somewhat unreasonable - the author for dismissing legitimate medical concerns, and the wife for refusing to consider any alternatives or compromises.

The author had a right to feel surprised and even uncomfortable upon learning new information about Ashley's background. Sexual compatibility and attraction are personal matters, and people can't be forced to feel attracted to someone or continue a relationship.

However, the author's reaction was extremely cruel and harmful. Calling Ashley ""a lie and a liar,"" saying ""I liked Ashley, not whatever you are,"" and giving her an ultimatum to leave in 5 seconds were all deeply hurtful responses. Ashley was being vulnerable and honest by sharing something very personal about herself - she wasn't ""tricking"" anyone, she was trying to be open before things progressed further physically.

While the author had every right to end the relationship if he felt incompatible, the way he handled it was unnecessarily cruel and dehumanizing. A more appropriate response would have been to say he needed time to process this information, or to end things respectfully while acknowledging that Ashley is still a person deserving of basic dignity.

Ashley did nothing wrong by waiting to share this personal information until she felt ready, especially given how dangerous it can be for transgender people to disclose this information.

The author accepted a babysitting job without getting crucial details about the child's age, size, or special needs. When they arrived and discovered the child was a 16-year-old with severe developmental disabilities requiring specialized care, they left immediately without any communication to the mother.

While I understand the author felt unprepared and potentially unsafe given the significant care requirements they weren't equipped to handle, simply leaving without explanation was problematic. The mother was left in a difficult position - likely needing to find last-minute alternative care or cancel her plans entirely.

However, the mother also bears responsibility for not providing essential information upfront. When arranging care for a teenager with severe special needs, it's crucial to discuss the specific requirements, challenges, and whether the caregiver has appropriate experience and training.

The author's lack of experience with special needs care and feeling ""outclassed"" is understandable, but the way they handled it - by abandoning their responsibility without communication - was inappropriate. A brief explanation that they weren't qualified for this level of care would have been the responsible approach.

Both parties failed in their communication and preparation, leading to this unfortunate situation.

The author and friend had a shared conversation where the friend said something funny. The author suggested turning it into a meme for Reddit, and the friend said he would post it later. After waiting a day and assuming the friend wouldn't follow through, the author posted it themselves.

Key considerations:
- The friend expressed intent to post it himself (""he would do it later"")
- The author waited only one day before taking action
- The author acted on an assumption about the friend's laziness rather than checking in
- The friend had a reasonable expectation that he would be the one to post his own funny comment
- This was a collaborative idea, but the original funny comment came from the friend

While the author's impatience is understandable and waiting ""a day"" might seem reasonable, they should have communicated with their friend first before posting. The friend had already claimed the right to post it, and taking that away without permission, even with good intentions, was inconsiderate. The author could have easily sent a message asking ""Hey, are you still planning to post that meme, or can I go ahead?""

The author is dealing with a painful breakup after a 2-year relationship where his ex quickly moved on to dating his friend and engaged in sexual behavior with multiple people in his friend group shortly after their breakup.

The author's feelings of hurt, betrayal, and confusion are completely understandable given the circumstances. However, the core issue here is that once they broke up, his ex-girlfriend became free to make her own choices about her romantic and sexual life, even if those choices seem hurtful or poorly timed.

Key considerations:
- The ex's pattern of breaking up to date others during the relationship was manipulative
- Her quick transition to dating his friend and sexual behavior with others in his circle shows poor consideration for his feelings
- However, after the breakup, she technically had the right to make these choices
- The author's pain is valid, but calling someone a ""slut"" crosses into inappropriate judgment
- His decision to distance himself from both his ex and the friend was mature and appropriate

The author is not wrong for feeling hurt or thinking the situation is ""too much"" - anyone would struggle with this. His mistake lies in the derogatory language and moral judgment rather than focusing on the legitimate boundary violations and inconsiderate behavior.

The mother has developed food restrictions based on her belief that a shot caused intolerances, despite medical testing showing no actual allergies. She's limiting her diet and social activities based on these beliefs.

The author has been supportive and accommodating for a while, but reached a breaking point during this dinner conversation. When the mother complained about stomach pain and blamed gluten in the salad dressing, the author challenged this belief, pointing out the minimal amount and lack of medical basis.

The mother responded defensively with ""you don't live in my body,"" which is a reasonable way to express that her experience is her own. However, the author then made a ""snide dumb joke about try telling that to a doctor"" - which they acknowledge was inappropriate.

The key issue here is that while the author's frustration is understandable given the ongoing accommodation of medically unfounded restrictions, they chose to respond with sarcasm and dismissiveness in a moment when their mother was expressing discomfort. Even if the restrictions aren't medically necessary, making snide comments when someone says they're in pain crosses a line.

The author is in a challenging position where they're struggling with language learning despite genuine effort. They've taken classes, used apps, studied textbooks, and are clearly trying to engage with their partner's culture by visiting Brazil multiple times.

Their partner wanting them to learn the language is also completely reasonable - it would help with family integration and show respect for her culture.

The financial and mental energy constraints are real practical limitations, not character flaws. The author is being honest about their struggles rather than giving up entirely or making excuses.

This appears to be a normal relationship challenge where two people need to find a sustainable approach that works for both of them. There's no indication of anyone being unreasonable, selfish, or failing in their responsibilities.

This is problematic behavior - when someone says no to sharing their food, that should be respected. The fact that she ""pouts"" afterward suggests she's not genuinely consenting but feeling pressured.

The author's justifications are also concerning:
- He dismisses her feelings as ""bs"" 
- He argues he deserves more food because he's male
- He minimizes the impact by saying it's ""not more than a quarter"" (which is actually quite a lot of someone's meal)
- He frames this as ""normal for couples"" while ignoring that his girlfriend clearly doesn't want to participate

The girlfriend's position is reasonable - she wants to eat her own meal without having to share it, especially when the sharing isn't reciprocal due to her dietary restrictions. Her ""no"" should be sufficient.

While the girlfriend could potentially communicate more directly instead of eventually giving in and then being upset, the core issue is the author's failure to respect her boundaries around her food.

The boyfriend's actions: He tried dog meat while studying abroad in China out of curiosity. This was a cultural experience in a different country where it's part of local cuisine. He was honest when directly asked about it and acknowledged the author's concerns about cruel practices like the Yulin festival.

The author's reaction: She's deeply upset and wants to end a relationship she previously saw leading to marriage over this single incident from his past. Her emotional response is understandable given her love for dogs, but the intensity seems disproportionate.

Key considerations:
- He didn't seek out dog meat maliciously or continue eating it regularly
- He was experiencing local culture during study abroad
- He was honest when asked directly
- He showed understanding of her concerns about animal cruelty
- The author is ending what she considered a serious, loving relationship over a past cultural experience

While the author has every right to her feelings and relationship boundaries, breaking up with someone over trying local cuisine during cultural immersion abroad seems like an extreme overreaction. The boyfriend wasn't cruel to animals or deceptive - he participated in a cultural experience and was honest about it when asked.

The author's reaction appears disproportionate to the situation, making this primarily her issue rather than his fault.

The author has been in an on-and-off relationship with someone for years, made promises about being together forever, had unprotected sex, got pregnant and miscarried, was disowned by her parents, but then told him she only sees him as a friend when he asked for clarity. Now she's upset that he's moving on with someone else.

The core issue here is mixed signals and poor communication. The author:
- Made lifetime promises and maintained an intimate relationship
- Had sex with him 
- Dumped him without explaining the real reasons (pregnancy, family situation)
- Told him she only sees him as a friend when he directly asked for honesty
- Now expects him not to date others despite her rejection

The guy asked for clarity about their relationship status, which was reasonable. When she said she only saw him as a friend, he logically concluded they wouldn't date again and decided to move on. His response was actually quite mature - he didn't want to be led on anymore.

The author can't have it both ways - rejecting someone romantically but then expecting them to remain available and not pursue other relationships. Her feelings of jealousy are understandable given their history, but her expectation that he shouldn't date others after she friend-zoned him is unreasonable.

While both parties could have communicated better throughout their relationship, the author is primarily at fault for the current situation due to sending mixed signals and having unrealistic expectations.

You're dealing with severe trauma triggers from finding your friend in a life-threatening situation. Your reaction - the flooding memories, returning self-harm urges, and emotional overwhelm - is a completely normal trauma response. You have a documented history of serious mental health struggles, and exposure to this situation has understandably destabilized your own recovery.

The key insight here is that you cannot effectively help someone else if you're drowning yourself. Taking care of your mental health isn't selfish - it's necessary. You already did the most important thing by calling for help and getting her medical attention. You literally helped save her life.

Your friend is now in professional care where she belongs. While emotional support from friends is valuable, it's not your responsibility to sacrifice your own mental health stability. In fact, if you push yourself beyond your limits, you could end up in crisis yourself, which would help no one.

Taking the weekend to stabilize yourself, process this trauma, and engage in healthy coping (like the planned camping trip) is actually the responsible choice. You can support your friend in other ways when you're in a better headspace - perhaps through cards, messages, or brief visits when you feel more equipped.

This is a situation where everyone is dealing with serious mental health challenges, and there's no fault to be assigned for people struggling with illness or trauma responses.

The author is an 18-year-old with bipolar disorder who has stopped taking medication and missed appointments without proper medical supervision. While they feel they're doing fine, several concerning factors emerge:

1. **Medical risk**: Bipolar disorder is a serious condition, and discontinuing medication abruptly can lead to dangerous episodes. The author's psychologist specifically noted they feel ""normal"" because of the medication - a common experience that doesn't mean the underlying condition is resolved.

2. **Lack of proper process**: Rather than working with their healthcare provider to adjust medications or explore alternatives, they simply stopped treatment entirely.

3. **Potential insight impairment**: The author's confidence that they're ""fine"" and ""matured"" could itself be a symptom, as bipolar disorder can affect judgment and self-awareness.

However, the mother's response of posting about this private medical situation on Facebook is inappropriate and violates the author's privacy, even if done out of concern.

The medication side effects the author describes are real and valid concerns that should be addressed with their healthcare team, not by stopping treatment altogether.

While the mother's Facebook post was wrong, the primary issue here is the author making a potentially dangerous medical decision without proper guidance.

The author contributes 70% to the joint account while the boyfriend contributes irregularly and sometimes misses months entirely. The author needed heels for a mandatory work event where the boss required formal attire. She purchased $130 heels, which is a reasonable expense for required work attire.

The boyfriend's reaction was disproportionate - he questioned the purchase, dismissed it as not truly work-related, demanded repayment, and stormed out. His comparison to buying Jordans for work is a false equivalency, as the author genuinely needed formal footwear for a specific work requirement.

Most problematically, the boyfriend spends over $300 weekly ($15,600+ annually) on marijuana, claiming it's a ""work expense"" due to restaurant culture and stress. This recreational drug spending far exceeds the author's one-time $130 work shoe purchase, yet he sees no contradiction in his position.

The boyfriend appears to have a controlling attitude toward spending despite contributing significantly less to the account. His behavior suggests financial manipulation - being the primary contributor shouldn't require the author to justify every reasonable expense, especially work-related ones.

The author's purchase was legitimate, proportionate to her contributions, and necessary for work requirements. The boyfriend's reaction was unreasonable and hypocritical given his own spending patterns.

The author has legitimate concerns about the dog adoption - a 12+ hour daily absence, an anxious senior dog who may not adapt well, and potential inadequate exercise for a high-energy breed like a husky. These are valid welfare considerations for both animals.

However, the author already expressed their concerns once with a gentle approach (""just make sure you've thought it through""), and the friend clearly indicated she didn't want unsolicited advice by snapping back. The friend is an adult who can make her own decisions, even if they might not be ideal.

The author is now considering pushing the issue further despite this clear signal. While their intentions are good (animal welfare), continuing to press unwanted advice on an adult friend who has already rejected it would cross into inappropriate territory. The friend has heard the concern and chosen to proceed - that's her right as an autonomous adult.

The most respectful approach would be to let it go unless directly asked for advice again. The author can remain a supportive friend while privately disagreeing with the decision.

Since the author is contemplating overstepping boundaries by continuing to push unwanted advice after already being told to back off, they would bear some responsibility for any resulting conflict.

The author is considering asking for increased child support from her ex, which is reasonable given his improved financial situation. Child support should reflect the non-custodial parent's ability to pay, and his transition from part-time student work to full-time engineering represents a significant income increase.

However, there are concerning aspects to the author's approach and reasoning:

1. She explicitly states wanting the money ""to support my whole family"" - child support is specifically for the child in question, not to subsidize other children or household expenses unrelated to that child.

2. The pattern shows ongoing financial irresponsibility - having additional children while already struggling financially, relying on others (father, ex, boyfriend who can't maintain employment), and repeatedly asking for extra money.

3. She's been a stay-at-home parent for 6 years while expecting others to financially support her choices, despite being capable of working.

The ex-boyfriend, while perhaps harsh in his delivery, has legitimate concerns about how his child support is being used and whether it's actually benefiting his daughter versus subsidizing the author's other life choices.

The current boyfriend's inability to maintain employment and legal troubles, combined with the author's decision to have more children in this unstable situation, shows poor judgment that affects all the children involved.

This appears to be a case where the author's financial struggles stem largely from her own choices and lack of responsibility, even though requesting appropriate child support adjustment isn't inherently wrong.

The author (25) made inappropriate sexual jokes to a minor (16) who had just turned 16, including a ""legal in certain countries"" comment and BDSM jokes. When the minor said ""no,"" the author switched to dark humor about human experimentation, which the minor also rejected. The minor never explicitly asked the author to stop, but clearly expressed discomfort.

The minor then escalated by involving the author's fiancé without explanation, causing relationship conflict for the author. However, when the author asked to be contacted directly in future conflicts, the minor responded with taunting behavior.

The author then ""snapped"" and made cruel personal attacks, calling the minor ""basically an insect"" and saying they ""won't amount to anything in life.""

While the minor's handling of the situation was immature (involving the fiancé unnecessarily, taunting), this is somewhat expected behavior from a 16-year-old who felt uncomfortable. The author, as the adult, bears primary responsibility for:
1. Making inappropriate sexual jokes to a minor
2. Not recognizing clear signs of discomfort (""no"" and continued rejection)
3. Responding to teenage behavior with disproportionately cruel personal attacks

The author's concerns about the age gap (18F with 43M) and her sister's inexperience are understandable and come from a place of genuine care. A 25-year age difference with someone who has never been in a serious relationship does raise legitimate safety concerns.

However, the author crosses a line by issuing an ultimatum - ""I wouldn't allow her to keep seeing him unless I was allowed to meet him."" This language is problematic because:

1. The sister is legally an adult and has the right to make her own relationship choices, even poor ones
2. The author has no actual authority to ""allow"" or ""disallow"" her sister's relationships
3. Ultimatums tend to push people away rather than protect them
4. This approach could damage their relationship and make the sister less likely to seek help if needed

While the author's protective instincts are admirable, the execution is controlling and overstepping boundaries. A better approach would be expressing concerns, offering support, and being available without trying to control the situation.

The sister's secrecy is concerning but understandable given the judgment she's likely anticipating. The older man's behavior could be predatory, but we don't have enough information about his actions or intentions.

The author's heart is in the right place, but the controlling approach makes them at fault for how they're handling this delicate situation.

The author purchased a Pro Controller with their own birthday money to solve a specific problem - Joy-Con drift making their games unplayable, especially Super Smash Bros Ultimate online. This is a reasonable purchase for a legitimate need.

The brother's request to share the controller is understandable, but several factors make the author's refusal justified:

1. **Financial responsibility**: The author paid for it themselves, giving them ownership rights
2. **Legitimate safety concerns**: The brother has a documented history of dropping the Switch, throwing controllers when angry, and potentially causing the second Joy-Con to drift after taking it to a sleepover
3. **Different usage patterns**: The brother primarily plays Fortnite (available on laptop) and watches YouTube (still possible with drifting Joy-Cons), while the author needs precise control for competitive Smash Bros
4. **Past behavior**: The brother has a pattern of using others' belongings to avoid spending his own money on replacements

The author even offered reasonable alternatives (brother could buy his own controller or a cheaper HORIPAD) and showed they respect boundaries when roles are reversed (asking permission for headphones and accepting if refused).

The parents dismissing legitimate concerns about potential damage and automatically siding with the younger brother without considering the full context is problematic, but the core conflict is between the siblings.

The author is feeling unappreciated due to an imbalance in effort and consideration in their relationship. They've consistently put thought and effort into special occasions (planning Yosemite trip, buying hiking shoes) while their husband has been neglectful (no anniversary/Valentine's gifts, last-minute birthday acknowledgment). They've also been helping with many things throughout the year without reciprocation.

The husband is asking for help with something the author is skilled at and could provide significant value with. However, the author is hesitant because they're feeling taken for granted.

This appears to be a relationship dynamic where one person consistently gives more than they receive. The author's reluctance isn't coming from spite or laziness, but from legitimate feelings of being undervalued. While helping a spouse is generally expected in marriage, it's also reasonable to expect mutual consideration and effort.

The husband's pattern of minimal effort on important occasions while expecting continued support from his wife suggests he may be taking her contributions for granted. However, we don't have his perspective on why he's been less attentive.

The author has legitimate concerns about protecting their property. They've observed their brother consistently damaging both his own games and the author's games by leaving disks on the floor and allowing them to get scratched. Since the author buys games with their own money and treats them carefully, wanting to protect a new expensive purchase is reasonable.

However, the author seems to be making assumptions about what will happen without first trying to communicate with their brother about being more careful with the games. They're also worried about parental involvement, suggesting they haven't discussed this issue openly.

The brother does treat games poorly (both his own and borrowed ones), which shows a lack of respect for property and consideration for others.

Both parties could handle this better - the author by communicating their concerns directly, and the brother by being more respectful of shared property.

The author is considering dating someone who sexually abused one of their closest friends, while actively planning to hide this relationship from the abuse victim. Even if the abuser has genuinely changed and received therapy, this creates several serious ethical problems:

1. **Betrayal of trust**: The author acknowledges their friend ""has a great deal of trust"" in them, yet they're planning to secretly pursue a relationship with her abuser.

2. **Prioritizing romance over friendship**: Despite claiming to ""care about a lot"" about the abuse victim, the author is willing to risk her wellbeing for romantic possibilities.

3. **Creating deception**: The plan to hide the relationship requires ongoing lies and puts others (like the boyfriend) in uncomfortable positions of keeping secrets.

4. **Potential for discovery**: Secrets often come out, and if discovered, this would likely cause severe emotional damage to the abuse victim and destroy the friendship entirely.

5. **Questionable judgment**: Even if the abuser has changed, choosing to date them shows poor consideration for the lasting impact on the victim.

While the abuser's apparent rehabilitation is positive, and the author's belief in second chances isn't inherently wrong, the decision to pursue this relationship while planning deception makes the author primarily at fault for prioritizing their romantic interests over their friend's wellbeing and trust.

The girlfriend isn't doing anything inappropriate - she's enjoying media and sharing her enthusiasm. Fictional character appreciation is fundamentally different from real-person attraction in terms of relationship dynamics.

The author was heavily intoxicated and admits uncertainty about whether the initial contact was intentional or accidental. Even if it was intentional, the response was severely disproportionate - stomping on someone's face three times until they were bloody and unable to defend themselves goes far beyond reasonable self-defense.

- Even if intentional, it wasn't described as particularly hard or threatening
- The retaliation was excessive and brutal - throwing someone down and repeatedly stomping their face
- The author continued the attack even when the person was defenseless

The author works full-time, sometimes 7 days a week, while his wife is a stay-at-home parent. Their child stays with grandparents one week per month. The core issue is the division of household labor - specifically that housework isn't being done regularly, creating a large backlog, and the author refuses to help because he believes housework is entirely his wife's responsibility.

While traditional divisions of labor can work when both partners agree, several factors make this problematic:

1. The author's rigid stance that housework is ""all"" his wife's responsibility, regardless of circumstances, shows inflexibility
2. His refusal to help even when tasks have become overwhelming suggests a lack of partnership
3. The fact that housework isn't getting done regularly indicates the current system isn't working
4. There's no mention of communication or problem-solving together

However, the wife also bears some responsibility if she's consistently not maintaining the household despite being home (though we don't know her perspective or potential challenges she may face).

The author discovered concerning evidence that her boyfriend's best friend was sexually harassing women and being verbally abusive when rejected. Multiple women came forward with similar experiences, indicating a pattern of harmful behavior.

The author's actions were reasonable and ethical:
- She brought legitimate concerns about predatory behavior to her boyfriend's attention
- She gave him information that was already public in their community
- She acted out of care for both her boyfriend and the women being harmed
- She couldn't have predicted his reaction of ""shooting the messenger""

The boyfriend's response is deeply problematic:
- He's angry at his girlfriend for informing him rather than at his friend for the harmful behavior
- He's prioritizing his friendship over women's safety and his girlfriend's wellbeing
- He's essentially saying he prefers willful ignorance to accountability
- He's punishing someone for doing the right thing

This reveals concerning values - that he'd rather maintain a friendship with someone who harasses women than confront difficult truths. His reaction suggests he may not take women's safety and dignity as seriously as he should.

The author did nothing wrong by sharing information that was already circulating publicly about harmful behavior affecting their community.

The author made a significant error in judgment by allowing teenage girls to wear bikinis/revealing clothing for a public fundraiser without considering the implications or consulting with administration/parents first. As the adult supervisor and coach, they had a responsibility to anticipate how this would be received and what kind of attention it might attract.

However, the author is a brand new teacher who was thrust into a coaching position they weren't technically qualified for according to district guidelines. They clearly didn't have malicious intent and genuinely seemed surprised by the outcome, showing genuine naivety rather than poor character.

The girls asked for permission and argued it was for comfort, and the author states nothing inappropriate actually happened during the event. The author also shows remorse and understanding that they made a mistake.

While the parents have legitimate concerns about their daughters being put in a potentially exploitative situation, the extreme reaction (screaming, threatening) seems disproportionate given that no actual harm occurred and this appears to be a case of poor judgment rather than misconduct.

The school administration also bears some responsibility for placing an inexperienced teacher in a coaching role without proper guidance or oversight.

This appears to be primarily a case of inexperience and poor judgment rather than malicious intent, but the author as the adult supervisor must take primary responsibility for the decision.

The author has legitimate reasons for not posting frequently on social media - they rarely post in general (only twice in the past year) and have philosophical objections to relationship posts. They also did acknowledge the girlfriend publicly through an Instagram story birthday message.

However, the author seems to have dismissed their girlfriend's feelings rather than trying to understand why this matters to her. Social media presence can be important to some people as a form of public acknowledgment and validation of the relationship. The author's response of ""it doesn't seem like a big deal to me"" shows a lack of empathy for their partner's perspective.

The girlfriend's reaction - taking down her post and saying she doesn't want to take pictures anymore - is emotionally driven but understandable given that she feels unacknowledged. While dramatic, it's not entirely unreasonable for someone who values public displays of affection to feel hurt.

The core issue is a mismatch in values and communication styles. The author isn't wrong for having different social media habits, but they handled the conversation poorly by being dismissive. The girlfriend isn't wrong for wanting public acknowledgment, but her reaction was somewhat extreme.

This appears to be a case where both parties could have handled things better - the author by being more understanding and the girlfriend by communicating her needs more clearly before it became a big issue.

The author was single and had a reasonable assumption that his ex was also single when they reconnected. They had been broken up for 6 months, both had been seeing other people, and she initiated extending their dog park visit by inviting him in for a drink. Her behavior and willingness to be intimate would naturally suggest to most people that she was available.

However, the ex-girlfriend was in a relationship and chose to be unfaithful to her boyfriend. She knew she was cheating but didn't disclose this crucial information until after they were intimate. This was deceptive and unfair to both the author and her boyfriend.

The author's actions after learning about the boyfriend are more problematic - continuing the affair knowing she was in a relationship makes him complicit in the cheating. However, his initial actions were based on reasonable assumptions given the circumstances.

The ex-girlfriend bears the primary responsibility here. She was the one in a committed relationship, she initiated the extended interaction, and she failed to disclose her relationship status when things became intimate. She essentially deceived both men involved.

While the author could have handled things better after learning the truth, the core deception and initial wrongdoing lies with the ex-girlfriend.

The author made a last-minute clothing change from a black t-shirt to a white undershirt, which made his physique more visible at the party. His girlfriend became upset, calling him ""inconsiderate"" and saying he went ""basically topless.""

Key considerations:
- The author's intention was practical (staying cool in hot weather with leather clothing)
- He genuinely didn't anticipate how the undershirt would look or his girlfriend's reaction
- When he realized the issue, he immediately apologized and offered to go home and change
- Other party guests were touching him inappropriately, which he handled by stepping back
- His girlfriend's reaction was quite harsh, calling him names and storming out

However, the author could have been more thoughtful about how his clothing choice might appear, especially given that he mentions being proud of his newly developed physique. A thin undershirt that shows off muscles at a party could reasonably be seen as attention-seeking, even if that wasn't the conscious intent.

The girlfriend's reaction, while understandable if she felt embarrassed or uncomfortable, was disproportionately harsh. She refused to communicate constructively and resorted to name-calling rather than having a mature conversation about her concerns.

Both parties could have handled this better - the author by being more considerate of appearances, and the girlfriend by communicating her feelings more constructively rather than storming out and name-calling.

The author witnessed someone make what they perceived as an insensitive joke about using a deceased staff member's death as an excuse to skip work. The author responded with a mild criticism (""Wow, kind of harsh, but okay"") when they felt the comment was inappropriate given that many students were grieving and had deep respect for the deceased person.

Key considerations:
- The author's response was relatively restrained and not aggressive
- They acknowledged uncertainty about policing someone else's grieving process
- They recognized that people cope differently, including through humor
- Other students appeared uncomfortable with the comment as well
- The author noted this wasn't an isolated incident of questionable remarks from this person

The author seems to have acted reasonably by:
1. Expressing their discomfort in a measured way
2. Not escalating the situation
3. Showing self-reflection about their response
4. Being sensitive to the grief of others in the group

While grief manifests differently for everyone, the author's mild pushback against what they perceived as insensitive behavior in a group setting seems appropriate, especially given that others appeared uncomfortable as well.

The author is asking for a reasonable financial contribution to shared living expenses - either monetary rent payment, or alternative contributions like cooking/cleaning if he can't afford rent. She's even offering him a significantly reduced rate ($300-350) compared to what he'd pay elsewhere.

The boyfriend refuses to pay any rent despite his name being on the lease, won't contribute through household work (calling it ""slavery"" and ""controlling""), yet still expects to live there. When the author disagrees with this arrangement, he responds with emotional manipulation, claiming she doesn't love him and saying ""awful things.""

The author has been clear about her reasonable expectations for financial stability and shared responsibility. She's even offered flexible solutions and acknowledged his debt situation. Her position that ""if you can't afford to live with me, then don't"" is entirely fair.

The boyfriend wants the benefits of shared living without any of the responsibilities, refuses reasonable compromises, and resorts to emotional manipulation when challenged. His behavior shows a lack of accountability and respect for his partner's reasonable boundaries.

The author is grieving a sudden loss and understandably wanted to stay home instead of going to the rave. However, there are some key communication issues here:

1. The author decided to stay home and the boyfriend helped sell her ticket - this shows he was supportive of her decision
2. The boyfriend offered to stay with her 30 minutes before leaving, but she didn't respond because she assumed it wasn't genuine
3. The author admits she should have asked him to come over, but expected him to know she needed support without being asked
4. The boyfriend has now offered again to come over on New Year's Day

The core issue seems to be a communication breakdown. The boyfriend did offer support, but the author dismissed it as insincere without giving him a chance. While it's reasonable to expect a partner to be supportive during grief, it's also reasonable for the boyfriend to respect her stated decision to stay home and not assume she wanted company when she didn't explicitly ask or respond to his offer.

The author's grief is completely valid, but expecting her boyfriend to read her mind about what she needs while simultaneously not communicating or responding to his offers creates an unfair situation.

The author helped a mentally challenged person hide from their caregivers, which prevented her from receiving proper care and support. While the author framed this as ""helping,"" they were actually interfering with the care of a vulnerable person who may not have had the capacity to make informed decisions about her safety and wellbeing.

The author admits their motivations were entirely selfish - they weren't acting in the girl's best interests, but rather using her situation to fulfill their own need for purpose. This makes their actions particularly problematic.

The author also involved innocent parties (a close friend and the friend's boss's daughter) in what turned out to be illegal activity, causing them to face police trouble through no fault of their own.

However, the author does seem to recognize that their motivations were wrong and is questioning their actions, which suggests some level of self-awareness about the harm caused.

The mentally challenged girl's actions (running away) appear to stem from her condition rather than malicious intent, and the caregivers and police were simply doing their jobs in trying to locate and protect a vulnerable person.

Ryan's actions were problematic - threatening to screenshot and report a joking comment to damage someone's reputation is petty and vindictive, especially over something as common as sharing homework in group chats.

However, the author's response crossed a clear line. Bringing up Ryan's personal relationship and infidelity in a public group chat was unnecessarily cruel and humiliating. Even if Ryan was being hypocritical about ""cheating,"" exposing someone's private relationship failures to embarrass them in front of classmates is a disproportionate escalation that goes well beyond the original conflict.

The author admits to getting ""really annoyed"" and wanting to retaliate, but chose a method that was personally devastating rather than addressing the actual issue at hand. The fact that most people in the chat thought it was ""unnecessarily rude"" confirms this crossed social boundaries.

While Ryan's threat was wrong, it was contained to the academic sphere. The author's retaliation brought in deeply personal matters and publicly humiliated him about relationship infidelity - something far more serious and hurtful than the original dispute about homework sharing.

Both parties acted poorly, but the author's response was significantly more harmful and inappropriate than the initial provocation.

The ex-boyfriend's behavior was clearly problematic - he was a pathological liar, manipulative, financially exploitative, and a cheater who gaslit the author when confronted with evidence. His actions were harmful and wrong.

However, the author's response involved deliberately seeking revenge by:
1. Intentionally going to a place she knew he'd be

4. Sending the taunting "";)"" text to ensure he knew what happened

While the anger and hurt are completely understandable given how poorly she was treated, the calculated nature of this revenge plan crosses ethical lines. Two wrongs don't make a right, and deliberately orchestrating a situation to hurt someone (even someone who hurt you) makes you partially responsible for the harm caused.

The ex's friend (HF) also bears responsibility for betraying his friend, regardless of the circumstances.

The author is dealing with a recurring hygiene issue with his girlfriend. While hygiene conversations are always delicate, he appears to have tried different approaches - from indirect hints to direct but gentle suggestions. The girlfriend seems to have poor hygiene habits that affect their social situations together.

However, the author's approach has several problems:
- The elaborate ""performance"" of asking if he smells first is patronizing and awkward
- Continuing to bring up the smell multiple times (on the bus, before going out) after she clearly became upset
- Calling the situation ""ridiculous"" during an emotionally charged moment
- Not recognizing when to drop the subject and let her process

The girlfriend also bears responsibility:
- Poor personal hygiene at 29 years old
- Refusing to communicate when upset (one-word answers, ""leave it"")
- Not addressing the underlying hygiene issues
- Misinterpreting his attempts to find solutions

The author has legitimate concerns based on past traumatic roommate experiences that affected their mental and physical health.

They've offered a reasonable compromise - paying for both rooms to live alone, which addresses their parents' financial concerns while protecting their wellbeing.

The parents, while having understandable financial motivations, are dismissing their child's mental health concerns and past trauma. They're being inflexible despite the author offering to pay the full rent amount they would receive anyway. Their cultural background may explain but doesn't excuse dismissing mental health needs.

However, there are some communication issues on both sides. The author could have been clearer about their roommate requirements before the property purchase, and the parents made investment decisions without fully considering their child's needs.

The teacher's behavior appears problematic - falsely accusing you of phone use, sending you to the office despite being wrong, making unfounded accusations about hand signals, and creating a hostile classroom environment. Even grief doesn't justify treating students unfairly.

However, creating and maintaining a meme page specifically targeting your teacher crosses an ethical line. While you frame it as ""just jokes,"" this is essentially cyberbullying a grieving person. The fact that you felt guilty upon learning about her husband's death shows you recognize this isn't just harmless fun. You even considered taking it down but then decided against it after another classroom incident.

Your frustration with unfair treatment is completely understandable, and the teacher's behavior toward you seems inappropriate. But responding with public mockery, especially knowing she's dealing with grief, isn't the right approach. There are better ways to address problematic teacher behavior - talking to parents, counselors, or administrators.

The author is dealing with normal dog behavior - digging in mud when it rains is instinctual for many dogs. The dogs aren't acting maliciously; they're following natural impulses. The fact that they dig in a spot ""outside of view"" is likely coincidental rather than deliberate deception.

However, the author's response seems disproportionate and potentially counterproductive. Yelling loudly at dogs can increase anxiety (especially concerning given one dog already has anxiety issues), and leaving them crated overnight as punishment is excessive. This approach may actually worsen behavioral problems rather than solve them.

The author acknowledges the dogs are ""following instinct"" but continues using punishment-based methods that aren't addressing the root cause. More effective approaches would include: providing alternative outlets for digging behavior, better yard management during rain, positive reinforcement training, or simply accepting this as normal dog behavior that requires management rather than punishment.

The author is engaging in completely legal behavior - walking on public sidewalks at night and smoking (while responsibly disposing of cigarette butts). They're not bothering anyone, making noise, or doing anything inappropriate. When they heard what sounded like gunshots, they made a reasonable decision to move to a safer location.

The interaction with the neighbor was actually quite positive - the neighbor approached with concern (""Are you alright buddy?""), the author explained the situation honestly, and both parties were polite and understanding. The neighbor even acknowledged it was just ""weird"" to see someone out that late, not wrong or problematic.

The author shows consideration throughout - they're conscious of how their appearance might affect others, they typically stay ""out of the way,"" they properly dispose of cigarette butts, and they time their walks to avoid disturbing their parents. They're being thoughtful about their impact on others while exercising their right to use public spaces.

The author's girlfriend is clearly upset about missing out on her absolute favorite Pokémon during a limited event, which is understandable given how much effort they both put in. Her emotional reaction, while intense, seems genuine given the context.

The key issue here is the contrast in behavior and consideration:

1. The girlfriend explicitly stated she would have traded her only shiny Gengar (during the author's favorite Pokémon event) if he hadn't caught one
2. The author has two Bulbasaur but refuses to trade one, even knowing it's her absolute favorite
3. The author was doing celebratory dances while catching multiple shinies as his girlfriend struggled to catch any - this shows a lack of awareness/empathy
4. The author dismisses her feelings as ""childish"" and ""petty"" rather than trying to understand her perspective

While the girlfriend's crying might seem like an overreaction, she's dealing with disappointment after a weekend of effort in poor weather conditions, combined with feeling like her partner doesn't show the same consideration she would show him. Her reaction appears to be more about the perceived lack of reciprocal care than just the game itself.

While it's true the cousin didn't specify an exact time, the author knew the cousin would be coming by at some point for his charger and had agreed to pick something up. When someone is doing you a favor, basic courtesy suggests being available or at least responsive.

The cousin's reaction (posting on Instagram and unfriending) seems disproportionate, but his frustration is understandable - he went out of his way to help and was completely ignored while standing at the door.

The girlfriend disclosed something personal from her past that occurred before they met. She was honest about signing up for sugar baby websites due to financial need for travel, and stated she never sent photos. The author's immediate reaction was to judge her character and question her ""self respect,"" which caused her to cry.

While it's natural to have emotional reactions to unexpected information about a partner's past, the author's response was judgmental and hurtful. He essentially shamed her for choices she made before their relationship, and for being honest with him about her past. His comment about ""self respect"" was particularly harsh and dismissive of her circumstances and autonomy.

The author did apologize, which shows some recognition that his initial reaction was wrong. However, he's now obsessing over scenarios he's imagining (her sending photos) despite her telling him she didn't, and wants to bring it up again. This suggests he hasn't truly moved past his judgmental attitude.

The girlfriend's only ""fault"" might be in the timing of this disclosure (while drinking/falling asleep), but being honest with a long-term partner about one's past is generally the right thing to do.

The author is expressing legitimate concerns about hygiene and cleanliness standards that could affect food safety at a potluck gathering. Basic cleanliness (clean surfaces, soap availability, sanitary food preparation areas) is reasonable to expect when hosting a food-sharing event.

However, the author's approach and language are problematic. Calling family members ""total fucking slobs"" and ""trash"" is harsh and disrespectful. While the cleanliness concerns are valid, demanding that someone clean their entire house before a visit crosses into controlling territory - it's their home, and they get to set their own standards.

The sister isn't necessarily at fault for having different cleanliness standards in her own home, though basic hygiene for food events would be considerate.

The most constructive approach would be for the author to either: offer to help clean/prepare for the event, suggest meeting at a different location, or focus requests on food-safety specific areas rather than demanding overall house cleaning.

The author is dealing with a brother who has substance abuse issues and has put them in danger. They've gone no-contact for their own safety, which is a reasonable boundary. The girlfriend consistently shows disrespectful behavior in the parents' home - entering without greeting the host, taking food without permission, being loud when others are sleeping, and using their address for mail without proper permission.

The author's response has been to disengage rather than confront - moving from polite nods to simply saying nothing. Given the volatile family dynamics (parents afraid to set boundaries due to fear of the brother's self-destructive behavior), this appears to be a measured approach to avoid escalating an already difficult situation.

The brother is criticizing the author for ""not welcoming"" his girlfriend, but this ignores both the girlfriend's consistently rude behavior and the fact that the author is trying to maintain minimal contact for safety reasons. The author explicitly states they choose silence over ""blowing up at her,"" which shows restraint and consideration for the family situation.

The author is not obligated to be warm and welcoming to someone who is consistently disrespectful, especially when they're already maintaining necessary boundaries with their brother. Their approach of disengagement rather than confrontation seems appropriate given the circumstances.

I told her I ...",Author,Everybody,0.8,0.5714285714285714,False,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author has legitimate emotional reasons for not wanting to participate - Christmas decorating holds special memories from when their parents were together, and using the same ornaments with the new fiancé feels like it diminishes those childhood memories. These are valid feelings about a significant life transition.

The mother's response is problematic. She:
- Falsely claimed the author was ""obligated"" to help based on living there (when they don't actually live there)
- Became passive-aggressive when told ""no""
- Used emotional manipulation to pressure compliance

However, once the author chose to participate, being visibly upset and refusing to engage positively was counterproductive. While their feelings were understandable, the deliberate display of unhappiness likely made the situation worse for everyone involved.

The author could have maintained their boundary by simply not participating, or if they chose to help, could have tried to be more neutral in their demeanor. The mother should have respected the ""no"" and not used manipulation tactics.

Both parties handled this poorly - the mother through manipulation and false claims, and the author through passive-aggressive participation after caving to pressure.

The author describes a pattern of bullying from their older sister (MB) that started when they were 12. MB left at 16, then returned unexpectedly 3-4 years later and resumed problematic behavior. During the specific incident, MB initiated physical confrontation by swinging at the author first, then continued to attack when the author stepped back. The author only physically responded after being hit twice, using restraint rather than retaliation, and stopped once MB was no longer able to hit them.

Key factors:
- MB was the physical aggressor, throwing the first punch and continuing to attack
- The author showed restraint by not immediately retaliating after the first swing
- The author's response (restraining rather than hitting back) was proportional self-defense
- The author only acted to stop the ongoing physical assault

While the author's verbal response (""go die or leave"") was harsh, this came after being physically attacked multiple times and represents an emotional reaction to being assaulted. The father's reaction appears to ignore who initiated the physical violence.

The author was defending themselves against an unprovoked physical attack from someone with a documented history of bullying behavior.

The author clearly communicated their boundaries after being expected to provide last-minute childcare with little notice. They discussed it with their husband, who agreed the expectations were excessive. The author was reasonable in saying they'd help in emergencies but not serve as an on-demand babysitter.

The sister-in-law and family appear to have made assumptions about the author's availability and time, dismissing their legitimate activities (hobbies, volunteering, house projects) as ""doing nothing."" Expecting someone to be available for childcare every other day with minimal notice, regardless of their employment status, is unreasonable. The family's reaction - calling the author ""lazy"" for setting boundaries - is inappropriate.

The author has been considerate throughout: they initially helped out, discussed concerns with their spouse, offered compromise (emergencies only), and show empathy for the sister-in-law's situation as a single mother. Having free time doesn't create an obligation to provide free childcare services.

The sister-in-law's situation as a struggling single parent is sympathetic, but this doesn't entitle her to expect unpaid, on-demand childcare from family members. She needs to arrange proper childcare rather than rely on assumptions about others' availability.

The author set reasonable boundaries while still offering emergency help, which is a fair compromise.

I broke up with my ex after dating her for a month and a half. The reason...",Other,Other,0.85,1.0,True,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author broke up with his ex due to manipulative behavior, including guilt trips and threats of self-harm. This was a reasonable decision for his mental health.

After the breakup, the ex:
1. Claimed she cheated ""lol"" in a spiteful way
2. Then said she made it up to hurt him
3. Continued threatening suicide and sending disturbing messages
4. Later revealed through a mutual friend that she actually did cheat
5. Persistently messaged despite being asked to stop
6. Only now reveals it was actually sexual assault, not cheating

The key issues here:

**The ex's problematic behavior:**
- Used suicide threats as manipulation
- Deliberately tried to hurt the author with false/misleading information
- Continued unwanted contact after being asked to stop
- Failed to communicate the truth about a serious situation (sexual assault) clearly from the start

**The author's response:**
- Reasonably tried to maintain boundaries
- Went no-contact to protect his mental health
- Had no way to know the full truth given the contradictory information provided

While the revelation about sexual assault is serious and tragic, the author cannot be held responsible for reacting to incomplete/false information. The ex's pattern of manipulation, boundary violations, and poor communication created this situation. The author was protecting himself from documented manipulative behavior.

The ex bears primary responsibility for the communication breakdown and continued harassment, regardless of the traumatic experience she endured.

The author asked about birthday plans and was told it would be dinner with mom. When they saw what appeared to be a recent Instagram post with another friend, they felt hurt and confronted their friend about it. The friend explained it was an old picture and she had indeed been with her mom all day as originally stated.

The core issue here is a misunderstanding based on an assumption. The author saw an Instagram post that appeared recent (posted ""an hour ago"") and jumped to the conclusion that their friend had lied about her plans. However, the friend clarified it was an old photo, meaning the Instagram post timing didn't reflect when the photo was actually taken.

The author admits to ""jumping to getting upset"" and acknowledges a pattern of getting hurt over holidays and birthdays. Their husband has even pointed out this recurring behavior. The friend's response to ""ask her next time instead of jumping to getting mad"" seems reasonable - she's suggesting better communication rather than assumptions.

While the author's feelings of hurt are understandable given their close friendship, they acted on an incorrect assumption without seeking clarification first. The friend appears to have been truthful about her plans and responded reasonably when confronted.

The author had a legitimate change in circumstances - a friend offered to lend the exact calculator needed, eliminating the need to purchase one. This is a reasonable situation that can happen in everyday transactions.

However, the author only gave 1 hour notice for cancellation, which is very short notice for someone who may have already made arrangements to meet, potentially turned down other buyers, or made other preparations for the sale.

The seller's frustration is understandable - they lowered the price, arranged express shipping, and blocked out time for the meeting. The short notice cancellation likely caused inconvenience.

However, the seller's response was completely disproportionate and inappropriate. Threatening to ""expose"" someone on Facebook, making threats about saving pictures, and using aggressive language crosses the line from justified frustration into harassment and intimidation tactics.

The author apologized multiple times and explained the situation wasn't intentional. While the timing was poor, the author didn't act maliciously and tried to handle it respectfully once the decision was made.

The seller had every right to be disappointed and even express frustration, but the threatening behavior and intimidation tactics are unacceptable responses to what was essentially a last-minute cancellation of a casual transaction.

The author has a legitimate grievance - receiving misdirected emails for 13 years due to others mistakenly using their email address is genuinely frustrating. They initially tried the appropriate response by informing senders about the mistake.

However, the author's current actions cross clear ethical and legal lines:
- Cancelling other people's travel reservations and appointments
- Sending hostile emails to colleagues 
- Ordering unwanted items to people's homes
- Generally impersonating others and interfering with their lives

While the other people are making mistakes by giving the wrong email address, these appear to be honest errors rather than malicious acts. The author's response is disproportionate and involves deliberate harmful actions that could cause significant problems (missed flights, lost appointments, workplace issues, etc.).

The author has other options available: better email filtering, contacting companies directly to remove the email from accounts, or simply deleting the emails. Instead, they chose to escalate to what amounts to harassment and potentially illegal activities like fraud and impersonation.

The fact that someone threatened legal action suggests the author's behavior has crossed into genuinely harmful territory.

The author admits to several problematic behaviors:
1. Dating someone they weren't physically attracted to and knew they didn't want a long-term relationship with
2. Allowing the relationship to continue for months while the other person developed deeper feelings
3. Accepting romantic gestures while knowing they couldn't reciprocate those feelings
4. Lying about the reason for the breakup instead of being honest (though tactfully)
5. Acknowledging they ""led her on out of guilt""

While the author's concern about not wanting to hurt her feelings shows some empathy, the fundamental issue is that they entered and maintained a relationship under false pretenses. They allowed someone to invest emotionally, time, and effort (including gifts and romantic gestures) while knowing they weren't genuinely interested.

The other person appears to have acted in good faith throughout - being sweet, making romantic gestures, wanting to maintain the relationship through distance, and even offering friendship when that wasn't possible. There's no indication of any wrongdoing on her part.

The author's guilt seems well-founded. While telling a harsh truth about physical attraction might have been cruel, there were other honest ways to handle this earlier (like recognizing the incompatibility sooner, or being honest about not feeling ready for the level of commitment she wanted).

The damage was done by letting the relationship continue when they knew it had no future, not by the specific way they ended it.

The author's intentions seem positive - wanting to encourage cultural connection and appreciating the delicious food from his wife's family gatherings. However, there are several problematic aspects to his approach:

1. **Assumptions and pressure**: He assumed she should know how to cook these dishes and continued pushing after she explained she wasn't taught these skills by her family.

2. **Dismissive response**: When she suggested he learn to cook these dishes himself, he dismissed the idea based on his ethnicity, saying he's ""super white"" - implying that ethnicity determines cooking ability rather than learning and practice.

3. **Cultural expectations**: He's placing expectations on her to ""embrace her culture"" through cooking, which puts unfair pressure on her to perform her cultural identity in a specific way.

4. **Ignoring her explanation**: She clearly explained that she wasn't taught these cooking skills (being ""spoiled""), yet he continued to push the issue rather than accepting her response.

The wife's response was reasonable - she explained her limitations and suggested an alternative solution. She's not at fault for not knowing skills she wasn't taught or for setting boundaries when feeling pressured.

While the author's interest in diverse cuisine and cultural appreciation isn't inherently wrong, his approach was problematic and dismissive of his wife's autonomy and actual cooking abilities.

The author made an unwelcome sexual advance while intoxicated, which crossed a boundary. When told to stop, they did, and when confronted the next day, they apologized appropriately. However, the core issue isn't really about this incident - it's about the author's response to their partner's ongoing emotional reaction.

The author describes a relationship pattern where they've already made significant accommodations (accepting messiness despite their anxiety, providing frequent emotional support, compromising their independence). When faced with their partner's continued distress after the boundary violation, instead of focusing on repair and support, the author becomes frustrated and starts questioning their partner's motives.

The most concerning aspect is the author's suspicion that their partner might be ""using this incident as a tool"" or ""blowing it out of proportion to get us back to an unequal relationship dynamic."" This represents a fundamental failure to take their partner's trauma response seriously. Whether or not the relationship has imbalanced dynamics, questioning the authenticity of someone's reaction to unwelcome sexual contact - especially when both parties are assault survivors - is inappropriate and harmful.

The author's frustration with the morning logistics and their desire to avoid dealing with their partner's emotional state shows they're prioritizing their own comfort over addressing the harm they caused. While the relationship dynamics may need work, that's a separate issue from properly handling this specific incident.

The author describes a pattern where their mother:
- Dismissed serious concerns (physical abuse by nanny)
- Showed clear disinterest in the author's social life while being engaged with their sister's
- Used the author's painful experiences (bullying) as jokes
- Selectively forgets information about the author while remembering details about their sister
- Uses personal information against them (discouraging dating based on shared relationship story)
- Denies access to professional mental health care while offering unqualified alternatives
- Demands forced disclosure of private thoughts and feelings
- Dismisses the author's past hurt as being ""narrow-minded""
- Refuses to respect clearly stated boundaries about communication preferences

The author has:
- Made reasonable attempts to communicate their needs and boundaries
- Explained their communication style and asked for respect
- Sought appropriate help for mental health issues
- Tried to give their mother chances by opening up when requested

The mother's behavior shows a pattern of emotional invalidation, boundary violations, and controlling behavior. The author is simply trying to protect their mental health and establish reasonable boundaries around personal disclosure.

The author and girlfriend legally re-homed a dog a year ago from someone who couldn't care for it anymore. The previous owner reached out asking to walk the dog, and they lied about being out of town because they feared he might try to take the dog back.

Key considerations:
- The dog was legitimately re-homed due to the previous owner's inability to care for it
- A full year has passed, establishing the new ownership and the dog's new life
- The previous owner's request, while potentially innocent, creates understandable anxiety for the current owners
- Lying isn't ideal, but their concern about potential attempts to reclaim the dog is reasonable
- The previous owner, despite seeming nice, put the current owners in an uncomfortable position by asking to maintain contact with a dog he gave up

While the lie wasn't the most mature response, the author's underlying concern is valid. When you re-home a pet, it's generally understood that you're transferring full ownership and responsibility. Maintaining ongoing contact can create confusion about ownership and attachment issues for both the dog and all parties involved.

The previous owner, though likely well-intentioned, shouldn't have reached out to maintain contact with a dog he voluntarily gave up a year ago.

The author planned a special evening with her boyfriend, who fell asleep early despite it being their monthly celebration night. When she later expressed feeling bored and lonely (not angry at him sleeping), he became defensive and argumentative. He made personal attacks about her not exercising, dismissed her feelings with ""I don't care"" responses, and told her to leave him alone.

While the boyfriend being tired is understandable, his behavior crosses into being unreasonable and hurtful. The author was patient - she didn't wake him, took care of his needs (water, phone charging), gave him space by sleeping on the couch, and tried to communicate her feelings respectfully. His response was to become hostile, make personal attacks about her body/fitness level, and gaslight her by claiming she was complaining when she explicitly wasn't.

The author's only potential misstep was waking him to switch bed sides, but this seems minor compared to his pattern of moodiness and verbal attacks. She's been accommodating throughout while he's been consistently difficult and hurtful.

The boyfriend is primarily at fault for his poor communication, personal attacks, and failure to take responsibility for ruining their planned evening together.

The author is questioning whether they should honor a casual, drunken comment about ""staying available"" made by someone they had a brief romantic connection with, versus pursuing other relationships while she's abroad for a year.

Key factors to consider:
- They were never officially in a relationship (no boyfriend/girlfriend labels)
- The ""stay available"" comment was made while both were drunk
- They're maintaining minimal contact (just Snapchat streaks)
- It's a full year separation with study abroad
- The author is in college and wants to explore relationships
- No clear commitment or exclusivity was established

The author is being thoughtful by even questioning this situation. There was no formal commitment made, and a drunken comment about ""staying available"" for a year-long separation is not a reasonable expectation, especially given the casual nature of their connection. The author has every right to pursue other relationships during this time.

The other person isn't necessarily at fault either - she may have just expressed a hope while intoxicated, not intending to create a binding commitment.

From the author's perspective, they went through significant trauma and hardship, and felt abandoned by their best friend during crucial times. They're hurt that H wasn't available during pregnancy scares and other difficult moments.

However, examining the pattern of behavior and interactions:

1. The author admits to calling H a ""selfish bitch"" during a disagreement about transportation/gas money
2. The author acknowledges having H pay for things and drive them around, even if they minimize the amounts
3. H expressed feeling ""taken advantage of"" and that the author was ""bumming rides and cash""
4. When H tried to set boundaries (asking for gas money, expressing concerns about the relationship), the author responded with anger
5. A mutual friend agreed with H's perspective, suggesting this isn't just H being unreasonable
6. The author's focus seems consistently on their own needs and problems, with less consideration for H's perspective or circumstances

While H could have been more supportive during difficult times, it appears the friendship became one-sided, with the author expecting support and assistance without reciprocating or respecting H's boundaries. The author's reaction to being told ""no"" about being MOH - immediately seeking validation that H is ""being a huge bitch"" - further suggests a pattern of not accepting when H sets limits.

- Informed Joey that Monica likely has feelings for them instead
- Encouraged Joey to have an honest conversation with Monica
- Gave Joey a clear timeline/ultimatum to address the situation
- Has been waiting patiently for Joey to take action

Joey, on the other hand:
- Is in denial about the reality of the situation despite being given clear information
- Has been avoiding the necessary conversation with Monica for months
- Is essentially living in a fantasy where he considers them ""a couple"" without any mutual agreement
- Has had ample opportunity and encouragement to clarify things with Monica but refuses to act

Monica bears some responsibility for ""stringing Joey along"" by continuing to go on dates while knowing his feelings are unrequited, rather than being direct about her lack of romantic interest.

However, the core issue here is Joey's refusal to face reality and have an honest conversation despite being given every opportunity and all the information he needs. The author has been more than fair and transparent. At some point, Joey's avoidance cannot indefinitely prevent the author from pursuing their own happiness, especially when Monica reciprocates those feelings.

The author faced legitimate challenges (illness, finals) that impacted their ability to meet an artificial deadline set by group members. However, there are concerning patterns in their behavior:

1. **Initial contribution imbalance**: The author joined late and contributed minimally to the proposal, accepting that they should do ""most of the final paper"" but then struggling to deliver.

2. **Communication and planning**: While the author communicated their constraints, they may not have been proactive enough in managing expectations or finding alternative solutions earlier.

3. **Last-minute project switch**: Leaving the group 3 days before the deadline and taking their work with them significantly disadvantaged the remaining members, who had to scramble to complete the project.

The group members also showed poor behavior - particularly the harsh 2am text message which was unnecessarily cruel and unprofessional. However, their frustration appears to stem from legitimate concerns about workload distribution and reliability.

The author's decision to remove their work and leave so close to the deadline, while understandable given the hostile environment, created serious problems for the other group members who had been counting on that work and the collaborative structure.

The friend's criticism seems overly harsh. While Tinder is primarily a dating app, the author:
- Wasn't actively misleading anyone
- Had casual, non-flirtatious conversations
- Disclosed her situation when it became relevant (when he asked for her number)
- The other person was understanding and had similar casual expectations

The author's approach was reasonable - she didn't owe a full disclosure in her profile or immediately upon matching. Many people use dating apps casually or to see what develops naturally. She communicated honestly when the interaction moved toward something more serious.

While the author could have handled the initial disagreement more maturely and shouldn't have escalated with profanity, the father's response was disproportionate and crossed a clear line. Grabbing someone by the throat is physical aggression that goes well beyond appropriate parental discipline, especially for a 19-year-old. The father also escalated the verbal conflict with name-calling and harsh language.

However, both parties contributed to the escalation - the author through defiance and profanity, and the father through verbal abuse and physical aggression. The father's actions were more severe, but the author's disrespectful response also played a role in escalating the conflict.

- Projected negativity from someone else's relationship issues

The friend is:
- Using manipulative tactics (saying ""I'm fine"" while acting upset, requiring multiple asks)
- Deliberately creating emotional labor for others as a test of caring
- Projecting relationship frustrations onto friendships
- Not respecting boundaries during a clearly stressful time

While ""ghosting"" isn't the most mature communication approach, the author has legitimate reasons for needing space. They're under extreme academic pressure and dealing with someone who has openly admitted to manipulative behavior. The author has been supportive but recognizes an unhealthy dynamic where they're expected to chase after someone who won't communicate directly.

The friend's behavior pattern of creating artificial tests of friendship and refusing direct communication while maintaining a ""nasty attitude"" is problematic and emotionally draining. During a critical academic period, the author has the right to prioritize their mental health and academic success.

The author could handle this more maturely by having a direct conversation about boundaries, but given the friend's admitted manipulation tactics, temporary distance seems reasonable for self-preservation.

The author and their friend had a long-standing plan to move in together. The friend then got into a relationship and decided to move her boyfriend in instead, while still expecting the author to co-sign the lease (because the boyfriend can't due to his probation status) and potentially move in later as a third wheel.

The friend is primarily at fault here because:
- She's breaking a long-term commitment without proper discussion
- She's asking the author to take on financial/legal responsibility (co-signing) for an arrangement that no longer benefits the author
- She's being unreasonable in expecting the author to be comfortable living as a third wheel with a couple
- She's prioritizing her new relationship over her existing commitment to her friend

The author appears to be handling this reasonably - recognizing the awkward situation, questioning the unfairness of staying on a lease for someone else's benefit, and considering getting their own place instead.

The boyfriend isn't really at fault since he's just going along with what his girlfriend proposed, though the informal way he ""claimed"" the girlfriend title is noted as annoying.

This seems like a clear case where the friend is being inconsiderate and unfair to the author.

The girl clearly acted inappropriately by:
- Cutting in line when you were already walking to queue
- Giving you a ""disgusting smirk"" after cutting
- Then having the audacity to ask for your pen after her rude behavior
- Calling you a ""rude bitch"" when you declined
- Talking about you negatively to her friends afterward

Your response was measured and appropriate:
- You didn't escalate the initial line-cutting incident
- You set a reasonable boundary by connecting the pen request to her earlier rude behavior
- You didn't resort to name-calling or personal attacks
- Your consequence (not lending the pen) was directly related to her actions

The girl initiated the conflict with her rude behavior and then escalated it further when she didn't get what she wanted despite her poor treatment of you. You simply maintained reasonable boundaries while remaining civil.

Your background information about being nicer to girls is irrelevant here - this isn't about gender, it's about basic courtesy and respect, which she failed to show.

The author is a 20-year-old in recovery who has discovered a career path that makes them genuinely happy and fulfilled - working at an opioid clinic helping others in recovery. They've been accepted to medical schools but realize they don't actually want to be a doctor; this was their father's dream, not theirs.

The father's reaction is problematic in several ways:
1. He's prioritizing his own dreams over his daughter's wellbeing and autonomy
2. He's using manipulative language, calling her an ""idiot"" and ""asshole""
3. He's making cruel predictions about her ""dying in the street addicted to drugs""
4. He's claiming ownership over ""the future he built up for her"" rather than supporting her independence
5. He's weaponizing her recovery struggles to control her choices

The author is:
- Making a thoughtful decision based on genuine self-discovery
- Choosing a meaningful career helping others in recovery
- Seeking independence as a healthy 20-year-old adult
- Still caring about her father's feelings despite his harsh treatment

This is fundamentally about a young adult's right to make their own life choices. While the father may be disappointed, his response is controlling and emotionally abusive. The author has found something that brings fulfillment and uses her experiences to help others - this is admirable, not selfish.

The core dispute is whether ""stomach"" and ""anus"" are close enough to ""intestines"" to count as correct under their ""too specific"" rule. This is genuinely ambiguous - these are all digestive system organs but anatomically distinct parts.

However, the key issue isn't the rule interpretation but how both parties handled the disagreement:

- Called their brother ""a loser"" and told him to ""go and cry somewhere else""
- Admits they wouldn't have conceded even if wrong due to the brother's attitude
- Escalated the conflict with name-calling

While the brother initiated the poor behavior by throwing a tantrum, the author responded by stooping to the same level with insults and mockery. The author also admits to being stubborn about potentially being wrong, which doesn't help resolve family conflicts.

The author established a clear, reasonable boundary: no unsupervised contact between their daughter and the brother-in-law who has an active heroin addiction. This is basic child safety.

The mother-in-law repeatedly violated this boundary by:
1. Not disclosing when BIL was present during visits
2. Exposing the 6-year-old to a traumatic verbal altercation with BIL at a gas station
3. Lying about father-in-law's presence during the ""supervised"" outing

Each violation escalated in severity, culminating in the child being exposed to drug-related drama that caused her distress (""making my belly hurt thinking about it""). The MIL then attempted to manipulate the situation by misrepresenting the supervision arrangement.

The author gave multiple chances and clear conditions. When those were violated, they implemented a consequence: no more unsupervised visits. This is appropriate parenting - protecting their child from exposure to addiction-related chaos and from an adult who has proven untrustworthy.

The husband's accusation that the author ""always hated his mom and saw an opportunity"" is deflecting from the real issue: his mother's repeated boundary violations that put their child at risk. The author's previous concerns about MIL's character don't invalidate the legitimate safety issues.

The author is asking for basic privacy and respect for their bodily autonomy - requesting that grandparents leave when they're changing clothes is completely reasonable. This is a fundamental boundary that should be respected regardless of age or family relationships.

The grandparents, particularly the grandmother, are:
- Barging into a bedroom without permission
- Refusing to leave when explicitly told the person is undressed
- Using ""respect your elders"" to justify ignoring basic privacy boundaries
- Staying in the room with the door wide open while the person is half-dressed

The parents appear to be allowing this situation to continue, as they could install a lock or establish household rules about knocking and respecting privacy.

The author has tried reasoning first and only resorts to yelling when their reasonable requests are ignored. Yelling isn't ideal, but when someone refuses to respect your privacy and bodily autonomy after polite requests, raising your voice to protect yourself is understandable.

""Respecting elders"" doesn't mean allowing them to violate your privacy or ignore your reasonable boundaries. The grandparents are using their age to justify inappropriate behavior.

The author expressed discomfort with their 14-year-old sister wearing a bikini, citing concerns about appropriateness for her age. The dad's girlfriend responded by calling the author sexist and accusing them of body shaming.

Key considerations:
- The author's concern seems to stem from age-appropriateness rather than malicious intent
- However, policing what a teenage girl wears, especially swimwear that is completely normal and appropriate for a 14-year-old, can be problematic
- Bikinis are standard swimwear for teenagers and are not inherently inappropriate
- The author's comment could make their sister feel ashamed of her body or clothing choices
- The dad's girlfriend's response, while defending the sister, was quite harsh in labeling the author as sexist

The author appears to have good intentions but their approach of voicing discomfort about their sister's normal swimwear choice was inappropriate and potentially harmful. The dad's girlfriend overreacted with harsh labels, but was ultimately defending a teenager's right to wear age-appropriate clothing.

The author is throwing organic food waste (orange peels, apple cores) onto grass areas while driving, but avoids doing so on expressways and doesn't throw plastic or processed foods.

While organic materials like fruit peels and cores are biodegradable, there are several issues with this behavior:

1. **Littering laws**: Most jurisdictions consider throwing anything from a vehicle to be littering, regardless of whether it's organic
2. **Ecosystem disruption**: Even organic waste can introduce non-native seeds or attract animals to roadways, creating safety hazards
3. **Aesthetic impact**: Food waste still creates visual pollution until it decomposes
4. **Setting precedent**: This behavior normalizes throwing things from vehicles

However, the author shows some environmental consciousness by:
- Not throwing plastic or processed materials
- Avoiding expressways where it could be more dangerous
- Choosing organic materials that will eventually decompose

The intent seems to be based on a belief that organic waste is harmless, but the execution is still problematic from legal, safety, and social responsibility perspectives.

The author made a clear, explicit promise to his girlfriend that he would ""cut out entirely"" watching porn if they became a couple. This wasn't a casual comment - it was a specific commitment made in response to her clearly stated boundary, which stems from her traumatic experience with revenge porn.

The girlfriend was completely transparent about her boundaries and the reasons behind them before they started dating. She gave him the opportunity to decide if he could accept this condition.

The author then deliberately broke this promise while hiding it from her, justifying it by thinking ""she wouldn't know and it didn't impact our relationship."" This shows he understood he was violating their agreement.

Now that she's discovered the deception, he's dismissing her feelings as ""ridiculous"" and ""extreme,"" despite knowing her trauma history. He's also minimizing the significance of breaking a promise that was fundamental to her agreeing to date him.

The core issues here are:
1. Breaking an explicit promise/agreement
2. Deception and hiding the behavior
3. Dismissing his partner's clearly communicated boundaries and trauma-based concerns

The author received a notification about an Amazon order being made, but it's unclear who actually placed the order. The author then cancelled this order without consulting whoever made it, apparently trying to do so before ""she"" notices.

- They cancelled someone else's order without permission
- They're trying to hide this action (""before she notices"")
- The item was expensive and the author determined they wouldn't use it
- The author seems to live with or share an account with someone else

This appears to be a situation where someone else (likely a partner, family member, or roommate) made a legitimate purchase, and the author unilaterally decided to cancel it based on their own judgment about the expense and utility. Even if the author had good intentions about saving money or preventing an unnecessary purchase, cancelling someone else's order without their knowledge or consent is problematic.

- It could come across as entitled or unreasonable
- The author would be trying to control a public space for private benefit

The better approach would be for the author to leave if others arrive, rather than asking others to accommodate them. While their intentions are good and their concern for their dog is understandable, the proposed solution crosses into unreasonable territory.

The author accidentally lost his cousin's phone while using it underwater when the waterproof bag's string broke. This was clearly an accident, not negligence or carelessness on his part.

However, when someone borrows an item and it gets damaged or lost while in their possession, they typically bear responsibility for replacement, even if it was accidental. The family's agreement that he should replace it aligns with this principle.

The author initially handled this appropriately by:
- Accepting responsibility 
- Offering to replace the phone
- Even offering his own phone as immediate replacement

The problems arise with the cousin's subsequent behavior:
- Demanding an immediate upgrade to a much more expensive iPhone X instead of equivalent replacement
- Involving parents and creating family tension
- Trying to force the author's father to guarantee payments

The author's response is reasonable:
- Offering to pay the current market value of the lost iPhone 7 Plus
- Refusing to involve his parents as guarantors
- Not agreeing to fund an upgrade to a more expensive model

The author has a history of making out with this female friend, including while both were in relationships (cheating). Even though he claims the friendship is now platonic, his girlfriend has legitimate concerns about boundaries given this history.

When the friend asked to stay over, the author made a unilateral decision without properly considering his girlfriend's feelings or discussing it with her first. While he did call to inform her, this was after already agreeing to let the friend stay - essentially presenting it as a done deal rather than seeking input.

The author's argument that he's let other friends stay over misses the key point - this particular friend has a romantic/sexual history with him that makes the situation fundamentally different. His girlfriend's discomfort isn't arbitrary; it's based on legitimate concerns about boundaries given their past.

While the girlfriend could have communicated her boundaries about this friend more clearly earlier in the relationship, the author should have recognized that this situation required more careful consideration and discussion given the history involved.

The author is considering applying for their old position while already having interviewed for a different position at the same company. They're concerned about potentially turning down the old position if offered the other one.

Key considerations:
- The author has already interviewed for one position and is waiting on results
- They want to apply for a backup option (their old position)

This is actually a common and reasonable job search strategy. Companies understand that candidates often apply to multiple positions and may need to make choices between offers. The author is:

- Showing concern for professional courtesy by questioning the ethics

As long as the author is honest if asked directly about other applications, and handles any offers professionally and promptly, this is standard practice.

The mother made inappropriate, racially insensitive comments to a guest in her home - asking about what ""color"" of boys he likes and continuing to press the topic despite visible discomfort. Her language was objectifying and treated race as a casual preference topic, which understandably made the friend uncomfortable.

When called out, she became defensive, denied what she said, deflected with generational insults (""oversensitive millennial brains""), and refused to acknowledge the impact of her words. Her pattern of fetishizing people of color (wanting a specific ""flavor"" of grandbaby) shows this isn't an isolated incident.

The author handled this reasonably well - they intervened when the friend was uncomfortable, tried to explain why the comments were problematic in a constructive way, attempted to de-escalate when things got heated, and showed empathy for their mother's background while still maintaining boundaries about appropriate behavior.

The brother's direct approach of calling it racist was blunt but accurate, and while it escalated tensions, someone needed to clearly name what was happening to protect their friend.

The cousin then asks to combine the parties at short notice, essentially asking the author to give up their planned celebration and make their son's first birthday secondary to her daughter's party (offering just a ""smash cake so he doesn't feel left out"" clearly indicates whose party would take precedence).

- The fact that the author's family is making a major international trip specifically for this celebration

The author is making a reasonable parental decision based on legitimate medical concerns. Newborns and infants have vulnerable immune systems and cannot receive all vaccines immediately - they rely on herd immunity and avoiding exposure to preventable diseases during their most vulnerable months. The author's position is medically sound and prioritizes their future child's safety.

The extended family members (aunts, grandparents) are making decisions based on medically unfounded beliefs that put not only their own children but also other vulnerable community members at risk. Their anti-vaccine stance creates genuine health hazards.

The author's parents are minimizing valid health concerns and pressuring the author to compromise their child's safety for family harmony. While their desire to maintain family relationships is understandable, they're wrong to dismiss the legitimate medical risks.

The author is being responsible by setting clear boundaries to protect their future child's health. They're not being ""extreme"" - they're following standard medical recommendations about protecting infants from vaccine-preventable diseases.

The author clearly communicated upfront that he wouldn't be able to celebrate his girlfriend's birthday on the actual day due to finals being one week later. His girlfriend, also a medical student in the same year, agreed to this arrangement and said she understood the pressure they were both under.

The girlfriend then planned an elaborate weekend getaway for the author's birthday, which he appreciated but explicitly told her weeks afterward that he couldn't reciprocate something like that before finals. Again, she said she understood and that exams were the priority.

However, at midnight on her birthday, the girlfriend broke down crying, upset that he didn't celebrate her birthday and that her friend was the first to wish her happy birthday instead of him. She claimed birthdays were extremely important to her, though she had never mentioned this before and had previously agreed to the arrangement.

The author made a significant financial decision (buying a puppy) without consulting their spouse, which affects shared finances and household responsibilities. This is a major breach of partnership communication, especially since they acknowledge being under the influence of alcohol (""mimosas we had earlier"") when making this decision.

While the author's compassion for the puppy is understandable, several factors make their actions problematic:
1. Making an expensive purchase without spousal consultation
2. Being influenced by alcohol during decision-making
3. Potentially falling for a sales tactic (even acknowledging they were ""probably duped"")
4. Then expecting their husband to ""cut them slack"" rather than taking full responsibility

The husband's anger is justified - he came home to discover a major financial commitment and new pet responsibility made unilaterally. While we don't know exactly how he expressed his anger, being upset about this breach of trust and communication is reasonable.

The author seems to minimize the impact (""getting a cute puppy is hardly the worst thing"") and deflects responsibility by focusing on their good intentions rather than acknowledging the problematic decision-making process.

This appears to be primarily about poor communication and decision-making in a marriage, with the author being at fault for the unilateral decision, regardless of their good intentions.

The author is in a difficult position where they want to maintain a specific living environment but are concerned about hurting their twin sister's feelings. Let me analyze the key factors:

**The author's perspective:**
- They have a legitimate preference for their current living situation
- They recognize past conflicts when living with their twin long-term
- They're genuinely concerned about hurting their sister's feelings
- They acknowledge it's not more their house than hers

**The twin sister's perspective:**
- She has equal rights to the house arrangement their mother provided
- She's expressed excitement about being roommates
- She has a free alternative (living with mom)

**Key considerations:**
- The house arrangement was made available to all siblings equally by their mother
- The author moved in first and established the current setup with roommates
- There are practical alternatives for the twin sister
- The author's concerns about living compatibility are based on past experience

The author isn't trying to be malicious or unfairly exclude their sister. They're trying to balance their own well-being and living preferences with family relationships. While it may hurt the sister's feelings, the author has valid reasons based on past experience and has identified that she has good alternatives.

The situation requires honest communication rather than avoidance, and the author seems genuinely conflicted about potentially hurting their sister rather than acting selfishly.

The author's intentions seem good - they wanted to be supportive and reassuring about their partner's past trauma. However, bringing up someone's painful past relationship experiences, even with good intentions, can be problematic because:

1. It can feel like pity or treating them as damaged
2. It forces them to relive traumatic experiences 
3. It can make them feel defined by their past rather than seen as a whole person
4. The timing and approach may have felt patronizing

The boyfriend's reaction was understandably defensive, though getting ""really mad"" was perhaps excessive. However, his subsequent behavior - flirting with other girls and being a bad boyfriend to force a breakup - was manipulative and immature.

The author's response of ignoring him for days was also problematic, as it escalated the conflict rather than addressing the underlying issue through communication.

Both parties made mistakes: the author in how they approached a sensitive topic and then used silent treatment, and the boyfriend in his angry reaction and subsequent manipulative behavior. However, the boyfriend's deliberate sabotage of the relationship through flirting with others seems more egregious than the author's well-intentioned but poorly executed attempt at reassurance.

This appears to be a case where both people handled things poorly, but the boyfriend's behavior was more deliberately harmful.

The author has legitimate practical concerns about sharing identical names - mail confusion, professional correspondence, dealing with institutions, etc. These are real logistical issues that would affect both partners daily.

However, the fiancée has endured a lifetime of frustration with her difficult-to-spell surname and sees taking her partner's name as a solution to this ongoing problem. Her desire for this change is understandable and emotionally significant to her.

The core issue is that the author is considering taking a ""stronger stance"" against something that's clearly very important to their partner, despite acknowledging how much the current name situation has negatively impacted her life. While the author's concerns are valid, completely shutting down this option without exploring alternatives or compromises would be problematic.

There are potential solutions they haven't fully explored - hyphenated names, one person taking a middle name variation, both choosing entirely new surnames, or finding other ways to distinguish themselves professionally while sharing a name personally.

The author seems to be approaching this as a unilateral decision rather than a collaborative problem-solving exercise with their future spouse. Taking a ""stronger stance"" suggests becoming more rigid rather than more creative in finding solutions.

The author has a clear, consistent anxiety issue about being in other people's homes that affects all relationships equally - family, friends, romantic partners. This appears to be a genuine psychological condition that causes physical distress. They've been transparent about this limitation from the beginning and consistently offer alternative ways to spend time together.

The friend has known about this issue for a decade, yet continues to take it personally and demand the author ""work on it"" specifically for her. She's making the author's mental health condition about herself and her feelings, rather than accepting it as a legitimate limitation. The friend is essentially demanding the author overcome their anxiety disorder to prove their friendship.

The author has made reasonable accommodations (going occasionally despite distress) and offers many alternative ways to maintain the friendship. They've been patient through repeated arguments about the same issue and have tried to explain their perspective clearly.

The friend's behavior shows a lack of empathy and understanding about mental health issues. She's treating a psychological condition as a personal slight and making ultimatum-like demands rather than accepting her friend's limitations and working within them.

The snake analogy is actually quite apt - both represent anxiety-inducing situations that cause genuine distress, and a good friend wouldn't force someone to repeatedly face their phobias.

The author asked their child what they wanted for dinner, and the child responded with their preference. This created a reasonable expectation that the parent would follow through on getting that food. However, the author then changed their mind to prioritize hanging out with a friend instead, telling the kids to ""find something to eat.""

When the child expressed disappointment (which is a natural reaction to having their expectations suddenly changed), the author dismissed their feelings with ""quit complaining there is food.""

The key issues here are:
1. The author created an expectation by asking what the child wanted for dinner
2. They then broke that expectation to prioritize social plans
3. They dismissed the child's legitimate emotional response
4. While there may be food available, the author went back on their word without explanation or consideration

The child's reaction (moaning in disappointment) was completely reasonable given the circumstances. They weren't being unreasonable or demanding - they were just expressing natural disappointment at a broken promise.

The author could have handled this better by either not asking what the child wanted if they weren't committed to following through, or by explaining the situation and perhaps offering an alternative solution.

He always greets me as ""Eddie"". My name is nowhere close to Eddie. There is ...",Everybody,Other,0.85,0.625,False,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The elderly coworker's behavior shows a clear pattern of disrespect and workplace harassment:
- Deliberately using the wrong name despite multiple corrections
- Publicly embarrassing the author in front of customers and management
- Making unsolicited comments about personal choices (diet)
- Acting condescending and superior despite being equals

While the author's final outburst involved profanity and raised voices in front of customers (which isn't ideal workplace behavior), this was a reaction to sustained mistreatment. The coworker's behavior appears intentional rather than due to memory issues, since he:
- Only gets the author's name wrong (remembers everyone else's correctly)
- Briefly used the correct name after being corrected, then reverted
- Shows no other signs of confusion in his work interactions

The author tried the appropriate approach first by politely correcting the name issue. When that failed and the harassment escalated to public humiliation, the emotional response, while unprofessional in delivery, was understandable given the circumstances.

The core fault lies with the elderly coworker who created a hostile work environment through deliberate disrespect and harassment. The author's reaction, though imperfect, was a response to sustained mistreatment.

The author was clearly uncomfortable with unwanted physical contact and had every right to refuse the hug. Setting that boundary was appropriate. However, the way they handled it - particularly the ""with the upmost disgust"" tone and harsh ""Because we aren't friends!"" response - was unnecessarily cruel.

While the ex-worker does sound problematic based on the described behaviors (lying about emergencies, entitlement issues, stealing personal items), those past grievances don't justify being deliberately hurtful in this specific interaction. The author even acknowledges they might be ""bitter"" about past incidents.

The author could have maintained their boundary more respectfully by simply saying ""I'm not comfortable with hugs"" or ""Please don't hug me"" without the disgusted tone and harsh rejection. The goal of stopping unwanted contact could have been achieved without intentionally hurting someone's feelings.

The ex-worker's past behavior provides context for the author's frustration, but in this specific moment, he was just picking up belongings and offered what he likely thought was a friendly greeting. His hurt reaction suggests the author's response was disproportionately harsh for the situation.

The author wants to see a band again while in London for work. They previously saw this band with their sister and had a great shared experience. The sister has clearly communicated that she would be ""furious"" and ""gutted"" if the author went without her, though she admits she can't fully articulate why.

The author's perspective has merit - logically, having an additional good experience shouldn't diminish the original shared one. However, the sister's feelings, while perhaps not entirely rational, are genuine and clearly expressed. She's not trying to control the author's general concert-going or musical interests - this is specifically about this particular band that represents a meaningful shared experience.

The author acknowledges this was a special sibling bonding moment and a Christmas gift, showing they understand the emotional significance. The sister has been direct and honest about her feelings rather than manipulative.

While the author has every right to see the band again, doing so knowing it would hurt their sister - especially when it involves a meaningful shared experience - would prioritize their own enjoyment over their sibling relationship. The sister isn't being unreasonable in expressing her feelings, even if those feelings aren't entirely logical.

This seems like a situation where being technically ""right"" doesn't make one blameless for the emotional consequences of their actions.

The author was honest about his feelings during an intimate moment, which while awkward, wasn't malicious. He immediately recognized he had created an uncomfortable situation and took responsibility by walking her home and apologizing. He followed up with another sincere apology the next day.

The woman's reaction - being ""very, very angry,"" ""super passive aggressive,"" and continuing to be hostile despite multiple apologies - seems disproportionate to what happened. While she had every right to be disappointed or hurt initially, the author made genuine efforts to make amends.

The author's behavior shows accountability and consideration. He didn't abandon her after the awkward moment, ensured she got home safely, and made multiple attempts to apologize. His continued friendly/cordial behavior when seeing her also demonstrates maturity.

The woman appears to be holding onto anger despite the author's reasonable efforts to address the situation. Her ongoing hostility seems excessive given that he was honest (albeit poorly timed), apologetic, and respectful in handling the aftermath.

The author was contacted by someone making increasingly serious suicide threats, including showing pictures of pills and having slurred speech. They tried multiple approaches to help - offering to talk, suggesting the person call emergency services themselves, recommending professional help. When the person became non-responsive after showing pills, the author gave a clear warning they would call police if no response came.

The author made a reasonable judgment call based on:
- Escalating threats over hours
- Visual evidence (cuts, pills)
- Audio evidence (slurred speech)
- Non-responsiveness after taking pills
- Their stated policy of taking suicide threats seriously

The timing was unfortunate - the person responded just 2 minutes before police arrived - but this doesn't make the author's decision wrong. They couldn't have predicted this timing.

The police officers' response was problematic. While they acknowledged the author ""did the right thing,"" they also:
- Treated the author dismissively 
- Suggested teens who self-harm shouldn't be taken seriously regarding suicide threats (which contradicts mental health best practices)
- Lectured inappropriately about online safety in a crisis situation

The author followed reasonable crisis intervention protocols: engage, assess, escalate when necessary. They had no other viable options given the limited information available.

The person making the threats bears some responsibility for sending serious suicide communications to a stranger, creating this crisis situation, but their mental health state is a mitigating factor.

The author has a legitimate medical need for this specific, expensive tea to manage digestive issues and pain. They have a limited supply that needs to last while away from home, making it impossible to replace immediately.

The step-mom offered the author's medical tea to the sister without asking first, then dismissed the author's medical needs by insisting ""we share in this house"" when the author explained the situation. While sharing is generally good, medical necessities are typically exceptions to household sharing rules.

1. Ask before offering someone else's medical supplies
2. Acknowledge the medical necessity when explained

Despite this accommodation, coworkers continued to litter cigarette butts on the ground, creating extra work for the author who doesn't smoke.

The author matched with someone on Tinder and had good initial conversations. When communication patterns changed significantly - from frequent back-and-forth to 2-3 short replies per day despite the person being visibly active - the author addressed it twice. The first time, he accepted her explanation about being busy studying. When the pattern continued unchanged, he brought it up again.

The woman's response was quite harsh - calling him an ""idiot,"" labeling him as ""clingy and needy,"" and stating she ""owes him nothing."" While it's true that early dating doesn't create obligations, this response seems disproportionately aggressive for someone simply asking about a noticeable change in communication patterns.

The author's approach of addressing the issue directly rather than playing games or making assumptions was reasonable. He gave her the benefit of the doubt initially and only followed up when the behavior continued. His decision to cut ties after being insulted was also appropriate.

The author discovered their brother has a vape, which violates house rules. They're weighing whether to tell their mother or dispose of it quietly. Key considerations:
- The brother is already grounded
- He has anxiety and depression
- This friend group is his only large social circle
- The mother would likely ban him from these friends
- Vaping is easily accessible at school anyway

The author is genuinely concerned about their brother's wellbeing and is trying to balance family rules with protecting their sibling from potentially harsh consequences that might worsen his mental health and social isolation. They're not enabling harmful behavior maliciously, but rather considering the broader impact on their brother's welfare.

The brother broke house rules, but as a minor dealing with mental health issues and peer pressure in an environment where vaping is readily available, this seems like typical adolescent behavior rather than malicious wrongdoing.

The mother has established clear rules, but we don't have enough information about whether her potential reaction (further punishment, social isolation) would be proportionate or constructive.

- They explicitly state they're ""not trying to be controlling"" and ""never said they couldn't think about others"" - they're just communicating how it affects them
- The partner's response of dismissing these feelings and blame-shifting is problematic
- Different people have different boundaries around sexual fantasies in relationships, and both perspectives can be valid
- However, when one partner expresses hurt, the appropriate response is discussion and empathy, not dismissal

The author's response - avoiding the friend because they find these views ""disgusting"" - is a reasonable reaction to hate speech. People have the right to choose their associations based on fundamental value differences, especially regarding basic human dignity and respect.

The author is questioning whether they're ""overreacting,"" but protecting one's mental well-being and maintaining personal values by distancing from someone who expresses hatred toward marginalized groups is not an overreaction - it's a principled stance.

The friend is clearly at fault for making hateful, dehumanizing comments about the transgender speaker and trans people generally. The author is simply responding appropriately to witnessing this behavior from someone they trusted.

The author had good intentions - wanting to protect someone they cared about and ensure their happiness. However, the execution was problematic in several ways:

1. **Overstepping boundaries**: The author inserted themselves into someone else's relationship without being asked or having the right to do so.

2. **Threatening behavior**: Giving a ""break her heart, I break your bones"" talk is essentially making a threat of violence, which is inappropriate regardless of intent.

3. **Lack of respect for autonomy**: The author didn't consider that the woman might not want this kind of ""protection"" or interference in her relationship.

4. **Potential relationship damage**: Such threats could have created tension or problems in the couple's relationship, possibly contributing to their eventual breakup.

The woman's anger is completely understandable - she likely feels her agency was disrespected and that the author had no right to threaten her partner or interfere in her personal life. Even well-intentioned actions can be harmful when they cross important boundaries.

The author is a university student on an extremely tight budget (£20/week for everything), which makes the financial burden of making apple sauce genuinely difficult. They politely explained their financial constraints when told (not asked) to make the dish.

The family showed no empathy for the author's budget constraints and immediately became hostile rather than discussing alternatives.

However, the author could have handled this better by suggesting compromises (like asking if someone could cover the cost, or proposing to help in other ways that don't require money). The author also seems to have ongoing family relationship issues that may be coloring this interaction.

The core issue is poor communication on both sides - the mother making demands without asking, the siblings responding with hostility to legitimate concerns, and the author not proposing alternative solutions. Both parties failed to approach this with understanding and flexibility.

The author observed their uncle petting their cat in what they described as an aggressive manner that was clearly distressing the animal. The cat showed clear signs of discomfort - whining and trying to escape. When the cat attempted to leave, the uncle physically restrained her to continue the unwanted contact.

The author first tried a gentle approach (""I don't think she likes that"") which was ignored. Only after the cat whined and was physically restrained did they become more assertive. The fact that the cat later showed pain/sensitivity in the area that was being petted suggests the uncle's handling was indeed too rough.

Animals cannot verbally consent or object to how they're treated, so humans have a responsibility to recognize signs of distress and respond appropriately. The uncle ignored both the cat's clear distress signals and the author's initial polite request to stop. The father's dismissive attitude (""she's just a cat"") shows a concerning lack of regard for animal welfare.

The author was protecting their pet from what appears to have been genuinely rough handling that caused the animal distress and possibly discomfort. This is responsible pet ownership, not overprotectiveness.

This situation involves a couple having playful tickle fights, where the author feels there's an unfairness because his girlfriend wears socks while he's barefoot, making her feet less ticklable. He's asked her to remove her socks to ""make it more fair"" but she's gotten annoyed and refused.

Key considerations:
- This is consensual play between adults
- The girlfriend has clearly expressed she doesn't want to remove her socks
- She's gotten annoyed when asked, indicating this boundary is important to her
- The author continues to ask despite her clear preference
- Bodily autonomy means people get to decide what they're comfortable with regarding their own bodies
- ""Fairness"" in playful activities doesn't override personal comfort and boundaries

The girlfriend has the right to keep her socks on for any reason - comfort, temperature, self-consciousness, or simply preference. Continuing to ask someone to remove clothing after they've said no and expressed annoyance crosses into pressuring territory, even in the context of play.

The author should respect his girlfriend's boundary about keeping her socks on rather than continuing to push the issue based on his perception of ""fairness.""

In the beginning we had a very strained relationship underst...,Author,Author,0.75,0.8666666666666667,True,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the perspectives and actions of both parties involved.

The author was in a difficult position - being a stepparent to a child they never truly bonded with, despite genuine efforts over seven years. They maintained kindness and care outwardly, which was appropriate given their role. After the divorce, they're dealing with their own emotional pain and healing process.

However, the stepdaughter is now an adult who formed what she believes to be a genuine relationship over seven years. She's reaching out frequently because she values this connection and likely sees the author as family. She's done nothing wrong and is unaware that the relationship was one-sided.

The author's current approach of slowly ghosting and giving minimal responses is understandable from a self-preservation standpoint, but it's causing confusion and likely hurt to someone who considers them family. While the author doesn't want to be ""brutally honest,"" there are kinder ways to set boundaries than essentially disappearing without explanation.

The most compassionate approach would be having an honest but gentle conversation about needing space during the divorce recovery, rather than leaving the stepdaughter wondering what she did wrong. The current method, while protecting the author's feelings, is causing unnecessary pain to an innocent party.

The author isn't malicious, but their handling of the situation could be more considerate.

**Issue 1 (Hair dryer at 9am):** Your roommate is using a hair dryer at a reasonable morning hour in her own room. While your sleep disorder is legitimate, expecting her to accommodate unpredictable sleep schedules by relocating her morning routine isn't reasonable.

**Issue 2 (Opening blinds at 11:45am):** Opening blinds before noon is completely normal behavior. Sleeping until nearly noon regularly and expecting your roommate to keep the room dark isn't a reasonable expectation for shared living.

**Issue 3 (Light double standard):** This is the most valid concern. If she expects complete darkness when she sleeps but turns on all lights when you're sleeping, that's genuinely unfair and hypocritical.

**Issue 4 (Trash duties):** If you weren't using the room trash can at all, asking you to take it out was unreasonable. However, this seems resolved since you mention it was ""first semester.""

The core issue here is that you have an irregular sleep schedule due to a sleep disorder, but you're expecting your roommate to significantly modify normal daytime behaviors (9am hair drying, opening blinds before noon) to accommodate it. Most of your complaints involve her doing normal activities during normal daytime hours while you're sleeping.

The only legitimate grievance is the double standard about lights at night. For everything else, the solution is better communication about schedules and possibly seeking accommodations through your school's disability services if your sleep disorder qualifies.

I would not ask her to get an abortion due to ...",Author,Nobody,0.7,0.75,True,"I need to think through this hypothetical scenario step by step.

The author is describing a situation where:
1. He would marry someone due to pregnancy (taking responsibility)
2. Wedding plans are made based on this pregnancy
3. A miscarriage occurs
4. He's considering canceling the wedding

Key considerations:
- The author states he would marry primarily due to the pregnancy and taking responsibility
- The wedding was planned around this circumstance
- The miscarriage changes the fundamental reason for the marriage
- This is described as taking responsibility, not necessarily being in love or wanting marriage for its own sake

The core issue is whether it's wrong to cancel a wedding when the primary motivation (pregnancy) no longer exists. While this might seem callous, if the relationship wasn't strong enough to warrant marriage without the pregnancy, proceeding with a marriage based on obligation alone could be harmful to both parties long-term.

However, the approach matters greatly. Simply canceling without consideration for the partner's emotional state after a miscarriage would be insensitive. The partner may have developed genuine feelings about the relationship and marriage beyond the pregnancy.

The author isn't necessarily wrong for reconsidering the marriage, but would need to handle this situation with extreme care and consideration for their partner's emotional well-being.

The boss's behavior was clearly inappropriate and unprofessional. Making comments about being ""second best"" to your boyfriend, telling you not to ""act like a spoiled child,"" saying they don't want you ""and that's that,"" and claiming they'd only hire you ""out of pity"" - these are all unacceptable ways to treat any job candidate, regardless of personal connections.

Your boyfriend is in a difficult position professionally, and I understand why he might hesitate to confront his boss directly. However, his complete dismissal of your feelings and insistence that ""it's nothing to do with him"" is problematic. While he doesn't need to jeopardize his career, he should at least validate your experience and support you emotionally.

Your decision not to attend his shows is a reasonable boundary given how his boss treated you. You're not asking your boyfriend to quit or confront his boss - you're simply choosing not to put yourself in situations where you'd have to interact with someone who was cruel to you.

However, completely shutting down all discussion about his work might be taking it too far, as his career is a significant part of his life and your relationship.

The boss bears primary responsibility for the unprofessional treatment, your boyfriend shares some fault for dismissing your valid feelings, and while your boundary about the shows is reasonable, completely avoiding all work discussions might be slightly excessive.

The author initially set a clear expectation that everyone would contribute $30 regardless of whether they stayed overnight, which everyone initially agreed to. This seems reasonable given that the rental cost is fixed regardless of who sleeps there, and everyone benefits from having the venue for the celebration.

However, the couple raised a legitimate concern about paying the same amount when not staying overnight, especially since they're contributing in other ways (alcohol and goodies). The author showed flexibility by offering to reduce their contribution to $30 total for both of them, which demonstrates good faith compromise.

The problematic behavior comes from the couple going around to other guests questioning the payment arrangement after initially agreeing to it. This creates drama, potentially undermines the author's arrangements with other guests, and puts everyone in an awkward position. Rather than continuing to work directly with the author on a solution, they're essentially campaigning against the agreed-upon arrangement.

The author made reasonable initial arrangements that everyone agreed to, showed willingness to compromise when concerns were raised, but is now dealing with the couple's disruptive behavior that could jeopardize the entire event planning.

Hu...",Author,Other,0.85,0.8571428571428571,True,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author made a significant life decision (moving to an expensive area they didn't want to live in) based on their parents' commitment to provide childcare. The parents were enthusiastic supporters of this move and repeatedly assured the author they wanted to continue providing care. The author explicitly warned them multiple times that moving would create a financial commitment since daycare wouldn't be affordable afterward.

When the mother became ill and needed to stop providing childcare, she gave essentially no notice via text message and suggested a solution that wasn't viable. This left the family in immediate financial crisis in a location they had specifically moved to for the childcare arrangement.

The key issues:
1. The parents encouraged and supported a major life decision that benefited the childcare arrangement
2. They were repeatedly warned about the financial implications if the arrangement ended
3. When it did end due to health issues (understandable), they provided no transition time or acknowledgment of the financial burden they had helped create
4. They seem genuinely confused about why this created hardship, despite being told multiple times about budget constraints

While the mother's health issues are legitimate and she had every right to stop providing childcare, the way this was handled - with no notice, no acknowledgment of the financial impact, and apparent bewilderment at the family's distress - shows a lack of consideration for the consequences of their previous commitments and encouragement.

The author's frustration is completely understandable given they made major life changes based on assurances that were later withdrawn without proper consideration of the impact.

The author clearly communicated they were having dinner with family and told N not to come at that time. N then went completely silent instead of asking when would be better or confirming plans. The author reasonably assumed N wasn't coming since there was no response, and went to bed at their usual early bedtime due to work schedule.

N then showed up unannounced at 9:44pm without any prior confirmation that this timing worked, essentially ambushing the author who was already asleep. This shows poor communication and inconsiderate behavior, especially given N's history of flaking multiple times.

The author asked permission in advance for guests to stay, and the roommate initially seemed open to it, even mentioning he was ""thinking if anyone can sleep in his room."" However, by Wednesday, the roommate clearly said no to people sleeping in his room, citing that it wasn't ""prepared"" and establishing a clear boundary.

The roommate has a known quirk about cleanliness and guests, which the author acknowledges they were aware of from previous conflicts. The roommate declined on Thursday due to not having time to clean, which aligns with his established pattern.

Despite receiving a clear ""no"" answer, the author proceeded to let two girls sleep in the roommate's room without his permission. This is a significant violation of personal space and boundaries. While the author frames this as being ""forced"" due to accommodation issues, they had other options like helping friends find alternative lodging or limiting the number of guests.

The roommate's anger about having his trust broken and boundaries violated is completely justified. Even though he may be difficult to live with regarding his cleaning standards and general laziness with household responsibilities, that doesn't give the author the right to use his private bedroom without consent.

The girlfriend made an honest mistake while doing a favor, and the item might still arrive safely.

The girlfriend's anger at being given the silent treatment is also understandable, though getting mad at someone who's already upset about your mistake isn't ideal either.

The author moved back to her dad's place after a 7-hour drive, arriving at 12am after being awake all night. She was exhausted and spent the day unpacking and settling in before trying to get some rest. When her mom texted asking for the boyfriend's address, the author waited until she was in bed to respond with ""I'm back at my dad's place.""

The mom's reaction was extremely disproportionate - immediately launching into angry paragraphs, calling the author ungrateful, making threats about student loans and phone service, using derogatory terms about the father, and ultimately cutting off the author's phone and health insurance. The author's responses were measured and she asked her mom not to send hurtful messages.

While it might have been considerate to notify her mom earlier about the move, the author was dealing with exhaustion from an all-night move and was actively settling into her new living situation. She did intend to call after getting rest, which is reasonable given the circumstances. The mom's explosive reaction to what was at most a minor oversight shows a pattern of taking anger about the divorce out on her daughter, as the author mentioned.

The date was self-centered and inconsiderate by dominating conversation and not showing interest in the museum's actual content, but she didn't violate any explicit agreements or social rules. The author felt frustrated but handled the situation politely by staying through the entire date and paying the bill without complaint.

Regarding the bill payment expectation - while it's reasonable to hope someone might offer to split costs, there's no universal rule about who should pay on dates. The author's disappointment is understandable but doesn't make either party at fault.

Hi...",Nobody,Author,0.75,0.6190476190476191,False,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author's father is turning off WiFi at 10-11pm, which affects the author's PC usage. The key factors to consider:

**Father's perspective:**
- He pays for the WiFi and has legitimate authority over household internet
- 10-11pm is a reasonable time for internet restrictions, especially for sleep hygiene
- He has genuine concerns about his child's wellbeing and gaming habits
- As a parent, he has responsibility for household rules

**Author's perspective:**
- Used their own earned money to buy the PC
- Feels the restriction is spiteful rather than health-motivated
- Notes the father allows unlimited phone data usage, suggesting this targets the PC specifically
- Gaming time (2-4 hours average) isn't excessive
- Feels this is punitive rather than protective

**Critical analysis:**
While the author may be right that the father's motivation is partly disapproval of the PC purchase, the father's actions are still within reasonable parental boundaries. Turning off WiFi at 10-11pm is a common and reasonable household rule that many parents implement for legitimate reasons. The fact that phone data remains available shows this isn't about completely cutting off internet access.

The author feels possessive over their Imperial Guard army choice and doesn't want their friend Larry to collect the same faction. Their reasoning includes:
- Wanting Larry to ""bring something fresh to the table""
- Feeling ""slighted"" that Larry wants the same army they've invested time and money in
- Believing Larry should choose from the many other available factions

- The author acknowledges feeling ""selfish"" about this, showing some self-awareness
- There are practical benefits to having multiple players with the same army (sharing knowledge, tactics, potentially models for larger games)

The friend said he could handle remaining friends and didn't want to lose the friendship. However, his continued obvious romantic interest suggests he may not be respecting the boundaries that were set or being honest about his ability to maintain a platonic friendship.

The father and brother are placing responsibility on the author to end the friendship based on assumptions about ""how guys are,"" which shifts accountability away from the friend's choices and actions. This perspective problematically suggests women should manage men's emotions and behaviors rather than expecting men to respect clearly stated boundaries.

The author has been clear about her position. If the friend is struggling with the friendship arrangement, the responsibility lies with him to either genuinely accept the platonic nature of their relationship or make the decision to step back - not with her to preemptively end a friendship she values.

The author's response was factual and appropriate: explaining that talking during comedy shows is disruptive and that others didn't pay to hear their commentary.

Basic etiquette at live performances dictates that audience members should not talk during the show, as it's disrespectful to both the performer and other audience members.

The author and girlfriend agreed to diet together, with the author taking on the role of keeping them both accountable. However, at the wedding, when the girlfriend asked for shrimp rice, the author deliberately overfilled her plate ""until it was literally overflowing"" in front of both families at their table.

While the author may have been frustrated about their girlfriend not sticking to their diet agreement, the method chosen was publicly humiliating and passive-aggressive. Making a spectacle of someone's eating habits in front of family members crosses a line from supportive accountability into controlling and embarrassing behavior.

The girlfriend's request to try some shrimp rice at a wedding - a special occasion - wasn't unreasonable, even if it deviated from their diet. The author could have had a private conversation later or simply declined to pass the dish, but instead chose a dramatic public gesture that humiliated his partner.

The author's actions were disproportionate to the situation and inappropriately public, making them primarily at fault for how this played out.

The author made a joke using ""disabled"" as a derogatory term about a sports team's performance. While they have their own disability (Hemophilia), this doesn't give them license to use disability as an insult or joke material that could hurt others.

The other person was offended by the disability joke and expressed this, which is understandable. However, they escalated by calling the author names, making assumptions about their experience, and blocking them rather than having a constructive conversation.

The author then responded with ""edgy jokes"" and told the person ""they have a problem"" - this was clearly escalatory and insensitive, especially after learning the person was disabled.

Both parties contributed to this conflict:
- The author initiated with an insensitive joke and then doubled down with more offensive content
- The other person responded with personal attacks and assumptions rather than explaining why the joke was hurtful

While the author's personal experience with disability provides context for their perspective, it doesn't justify using disability as joke material in public spaces where it can hurt others. Similarly, being offended doesn't justify personal attacks.

Both people could have handled this much better - the author could have been more considerate with their humor, and the other person could have communicated their concerns more constructively.

Pat's behavior is problematic - constantly dominating conversations, cutting people off, and dismissing topics that matter to others shows poor social skills and inconsideration. Her pattern of making everything about herself is frustrating and unfair to friends.

However, the author's response crossed a clear line. Calling someone ""stupid"" is a personal attack that's hurtful and inappropriate, regardless of how frustrated you might be. There were many better ways to handle this situation - the author could have:
- Directly addressed the conversation pattern (""I'd like to finish what I was saying"")
- Had a separate conversation about the dynamic
- Set boundaries about taking turns speaking
- Simply walked away if needed

While Pat's behavior was the catalyst, the author chose to respond with an insult rather than addressing the real issue constructively. Pat's reaction of getting upset and leaving was understandable given the personal attack.

Both people contributed to this conflict - Pat through her ongoing inconsiderate behavior, and the author through choosing to respond with a hurtful insult instead of addressing the problem appropriately.

The author has bird feeders with management approval that serve a legitimate purpose (keeping their cats entertained and preventing property damage). The neighbor is upset about bird droppings on his car, which he parks under a tree in an unassigned parking area where he could easily park elsewhere.

The author is being reasonable by:
- Having proper permission from management
- Using the feeders to solve a legitimate problem (destructive cats)
- Parking in the same area without issues by avoiding the tree
- Considering solutions like a car cover

The neighbor is being unreasonable by:
- Choosing to park under a tree in a wooded area and expecting no bird droppings
- Refusing to use available alternative parking spots

- Engaging in intimidating surveillance behavior

The author hasn't done anything wrong - they have permission, are solving a legitimate problem, and the neighbor has reasonable alternatives available.

The author is asking her boyfriend to change his underwear preference despite him having valid reasons for his choice:
1. He finds briefs more comfortable and supportive
2. He has a medical reason - testicular pain where his doctor specifically recommended briefs
3. He tried the boxer briefs she bought but didn't like them

While it's natural to have preferences about what's attractive, the author is prioritizing her aesthetic preferences over her boyfriend's comfort and medical needs. She continues pushing the issue even after he's explained his reasons and tried her suggestion.

The boyfriend has been reasonable - he explained his preferences, tried what she suggested, and has a legitimate medical reason for his choice. His underwear choice is ultimately a personal decision about his own body and comfort.

This appears to be a case where the author is being unreasonable by not accepting her partner's choice about his own undergarments, especially given the medical component.

The author is dealing with a 15-year-old who has consistently been disrespectful, two-faced, and deliberately provocative. Bubbles has:
- Been openly rude and ignored her when he doesn't want something
- Deliberately done things to upset her for his own amusement
- Escalated relationship drama and laughed at her distress
- Continuously made inappropriate comments about her boyfriend being with other girls

The author's response has been mature and measured:
- She hasn't been openly rude or started fights
- She's simply stopped sharing resources with someone who treats her poorly
- She's been honest when directly asked about her feelings
- She's actively avoiding conflict by staying away from him

While Bubbles is young, 15 is old enough to understand that actions have consequences. The author isn't obligated to pretend to like someone who consistently disrespects her, especially in what should be her safe space (her boyfriend's family home where she lives).

The boyfriend, best friend, and little brother are wrong to expect her to tolerate disrespectful behavior just because of the person's age. Setting boundaries by not engaging with someone who treats you poorly is actually the mature response.

The author is being reasonable and handling a difficult situation appropriately by avoiding conflict while not pretending everything is fine.

The author was dealing with significant stress (5 exams, no sleep for 3 days) and had been consistently supportive of their girlfriend despite her repeated negativity throughout the day. When she got upset about her work for the fifth time, the author responded with ""whatever you say"" - which, while not ideal, seems to reflect genuine exhaustion rather than malice.

The girlfriend's reaction was disproportionate - becoming ""furious"" and telling him to ""just don't talk then"" over what was essentially a moment of fatigue from someone who had been supportive all day. Her pattern of constant negativity and mood swings that she directs at the author, combined with this extreme reaction, suggests she's not managing her emotions well or considering her partner's state.

The author recognized the situation, gave her space as requested, and even acknowledged potential fault - showing self-awareness and maturity. While ""whatever you say"" wasn't the most supportive response, it's understandable given the circumstances and doesn't rise to the level of being ""at fault"" in this conflict.

The girlfriend's inability to recognize her partner's stress, her disproportionate reaction, and her pattern of taking out frustrations on him make her primarily responsible for this particular incident.

The core issue is whether the sister should graduate early or stay for her senior year. Let me consider each person's position:

**The sister's perspective:**
- She has valid reasons for staying (gaining college credits, maintaining friendships)
- She has a guaranteed scholarship, so there's no financial pressure to rush
- The social aspect of high school is developmentally important for teenagers
- She's making an informed choice about her own education and life path

**The author's perspective:**
- Genuinely cares about sister's future and sees early graduation as a great opportunity
- Concerned about the quality of the current school
- However, continues pushing the issue despite parents asking them to drop it
- Dismisses sister's stated reasons and assumes hidden motives about friends

**The parents' perspective:**
- Supporting their daughter's autonomy in making educational decisions
- Trying to maintain family peace by asking for the topic to be dropped
- Taking a reasonable approach by letting the student decide

The author means well but is overstepping boundaries. The sister is the one who will live with the consequences of this decision, and she has legitimate reasons for her choice. The author's continued pressure despite parental intervention and the sister's clear preference is problematic. There's no objective ""right"" answer about whether to graduate early - it's a personal decision with valid arguments on both sides.

The author has a pattern of concerning behavior:
1. Has a history of cheating and lying to partners
2. Lied to current girlfriend about past sexual encounters
3. Continues discussing private relationship matters with his ex despite his girlfriend's explicit request to stop
4. Dismisses his girlfriend's legitimate concerns as ""melodramatic and childish""
5. Shows little empathy for how his actions affect his current relationship

While the girlfriend could potentially handle this more maturely, her concerns are completely valid given:
- His documented history of dishonesty and infidelity
- His continued boundary violations after she's communicated her discomfort
- The fact that he's sharing intimate details of their relationship with someone he used to be romantically involved with

The author frames this as simply ""wanting to stay friends with an ex,"" but it's really about repeatedly violating his girlfriend's trust and boundaries while dismissing her feelings. His inability to see why discussing private relationship matters with an ex-partner would be problematic, especially given his history, shows a significant lack of awareness and respect.

The girlfriend's ultimatum about boundaries is a reasonable response to repeated boundary violations, not an overreaction.

The coworker is being pushy and not respecting clear boundaries when the author repeatedly says ""no"" to food offers. This behavior is annoying and inappropriate - when someone declines food multiple times, continuing to ask becomes harassment rather than kindness.

However, the author hasn't actually done anything wrong yet. They're simply considering whether to have a direct conversation asking the coworker to stop this behavior. Having a polite, direct conversation about boundaries is actually the mature and appropriate response here.

The author gave the coworker a job recommendation in good faith, and now they're dealing with discovering annoying habits they weren't previously aware of. This is a normal workplace situation that requires direct communication to resolve.

The coworker's persistence in pushing food after multiple ""no"" responses shows a lack of social awareness and respect for boundaries, even if well-intentioned.

Since the author is contemplating the right approach (asking directly rather than being rude or going behind the coworker's back), and the coworker is the one exhibiting problematic boundary-crossing behavior, the fault lies with the coworker's actions.

The girl cancelled due to being sick on the author's birthday, which is understandable - illness isn't something people can control. She apologized multiple times, tried to reschedule, and made efforts to make it up to him. While it's disappointing that this has happened 2-3 times in a year, if she genuinely has health issues, this may not be intentional disrespect.

The author's response was to give one-word answers, stop responding entirely, and then leave her on read when she tried to reach out again. While his frustration about repeated cancellations is understandable, completely cutting off communication without explanation is an immature way to handle the situation.

If the pattern of cancellations was truly problematic for him, the mature approach would have been to have an honest conversation about his concerns or simply end the relationship directly rather than ghosting. Ghosting someone who is making genuine efforts to apologize and reschedule is unnecessarily cruel.

The author acknowledges she has ongoing health issues (""she is really sickly""), which suggests these cancellations may be legitimate rather than signs of disrespect or lack of interest.

The security guard had legitimate reasons for the original ban - the regular was smoking inside the mall while intoxicated, which is clearly unacceptable behavior. The guard was doing his job by enforcing mall rules.

When the ban was lifted against his professional judgment, he accepted it under protest, showing he respects the chain of command. During the incident, he was again doing his job - closing the mall at closing time and asking people to leave.

The regular escalated the situation by:
- Refusing to leave when asked
- Making demands and throwing a ""hissy-fit"" 
- Yelling and causing a disturbance near an open restaurant
- Physically striking the security guard

The guard showed restraint by trying to de-escalate verbally first, and only used physical force after being punched. His response (picking up and removing the person) was proportionate to the threat and his job duties.

The team leader calling the guard ""harsh"" and an ""asshole"" for wanting to reinstate the ban after being physically assaulted while doing his job is unreasonable. The guard has legitimate safety and professional concerns.

The author's actions seem reasonable and respectful:
- He interpreted what he thought were romantic signals and asked the first friend out
- When rejected, he accepted it gracefully and maintained the friendship
- With the second friend, he waited until she was single, recognized his returning feelings, and asked her out respectfully
- He was prepared to accept whatever answer she gave

The timeline shows about 2-3 months between asking out the first friend (late November) and the second friend (after the holidays), which is a reasonable amount of time to develop new feelings, especially since he had a prior crush on the second friend.

The other people's reaction seems problematic:
- They're gossiping about his private romantic life
- They're judging him for having normal human emotions and attractions
- They're creating drama and turning others against him for respectful behavior
- The second friend shared private information about his romantic interest, leading to social consequences

The author handled both situations maturely - he asked directly rather than playing games, accepted rejections gracefully, and maintained friendships. Having feelings for different people over a few months is completely normal human behavior, especially for someone who appears to be young and single.

The author is dealing with genuinely hazardous air quality (250 AQI is in the ""very unhealthy"" range) that's causing them physical symptoms like burning eyes and sniffling. They've been responsible by wearing masks and limiting outdoor exposure for several days.

Today, they provided indoor play, some backyard time, and even arranged a social visit with a neighbor dog. This shows they're actively trying to meet their dog's needs despite the challenging circumstances.

The author is now questioning whether they should expose both themselves and their dog to harmful air quality for an additional 30 minutes, simply because they're interpreting their dog's expression as disappointment.

The reality is:
- Dogs don't understand air quality indexes or health risks
- The author has already provided reasonable exercise and stimulation given the circumstances
- Exposing both human and pet to ""very unhealthy"" air quality for non-essential activities would be poor judgment

2. **Alternative explanations**: There are many innocent reasons socks could get mixed up - laundry being put away differently, accidental bumping of the drawer, normal shifting over time, or even the girlfriend doing a favor by putting away clean laundry.

The author has legitimate concerns about her boyfriend's female coworkers who have clearly expressed romantic interest in him. Girl 1 has openly hit on him and made inappropriate comments, while Girl 2 regularly compares her fiancé unfavorably to the boyfriend. These behaviors cross professional boundaries.

However, the author's approach of telling her boyfriend not to get them gifts at all may be too controlling. While her concerns are valid, completely forbidding workplace gift-giving could come across as overly restrictive, especially since he gives gifts to other coworkers too.

The boyfriend appears to be somewhat naive or avoidant about setting appropriate boundaries with these women. He seems to recognize their interest (admitting Girl 2 has a crush) but continues engaging in ways that might encourage it, like spending significant time with them and feeling obligated to give more expensive gifts.

The real issue isn't the gift-giving itself, but the lack of proper boundaries in these relationships. A more constructive approach would be discussing boundary-setting rather than gift prohibition.

The author approached her mother based on previous positive conversations where the mother explicitly said she wanted her daughter to be safe and would support birth control coverage. The mother had even shared her own experience using birth control early in marriage.

When the author followed through on this apparent openness by discussing getting an IUD or Nexplanon, the mother's response shifted dramatically. Instead of the supportive discussion that was implied, the mother began lecturing about STDs, abortion-related concerns, divorce statistics, and pressuring for personal information about sexual partners.

The author has been reasonable throughout - she reflected on her decision before bringing it up, she's maintaining appropriate boundaries about her private life, and she's expressed that the lectures make her uncomfortable. She's even acknowledged feeling obligated to listen due to the insurance coverage.

The mother appears to have created a ""bait-and-switch"" situation - presenting herself as open and supportive initially, then using that trust to launch into lectures and attempts to change her adult daughter's mind.

The father's intentions may have been good - wanting to help his son - but his approach was problematic. He ambushed the 16-year-old with an unsolicited intervention about his dating life and masculinity, making assumptions about what the teen wants or needs. When the son politely declined (""I'm fine thanks""), the father pushed harder with criticism about needing to ""be more of a man"" and attacking his interests.

The 16-year-old's explosive response, while disrespectful, is understandable given he was cornered, criticized, and had his lifestyle attacked. Teenagers often react strongly when they feel their autonomy is threatened or when they're compared unfavorably to siblings.

The author participated in this intervention without understanding what was happening and now seeks validation for agreeing with the father's ""advice"" - which wasn't really advice but rather criticism and demands for the teen to change his personality and interests.

The core issues are:
- Forcing unwanted ""help"" on someone who didn't ask for it

The girlfriend's behavior is problematic in several ways:
- She immediately accused the author of ""wasting time"" rather than asking neutrally about their day
- When told ""no,"" she didn't accept the answer and demanded to see browsing history
- She physically grabbed the mouse without permission
- She used her personal trust issues to justify violating the author's privacy
- She escalated to crying when her boundary violation was resisted

The author's response was reasonable:
- They answered her question honestly (they were working and doing ""light surfing"")
- They appropriately defended their privacy by taking back the mouse
- They clearly communicated that browsing histories are private
- Nothing in their account suggests they were hiding anything inappropriate

Privacy in relationships is important and healthy. Having ""trust issues"" doesn't give someone the right to violate their partner's reasonable boundaries. The girlfriend's demand to inspect browsing history, especially after grabbing the mouse, crosses a line into controlling behavior.

The author was simply maintaining a normal privacy boundary that exists in healthy relationships.

The author's girlfriend is 6 months pregnant with twins, which is physically demanding and uncomfortable. She made a reasonable request for a foot rub - a small act of care that could provide relief during a challenging pregnancy. While the author has the right to say no to any request, the context matters significantly here.

Pregnancy with twins at 6 months involves considerable physical discomfort, swelling, and pain. A foot rub is a minor gesture that could provide meaningful relief. The author's reasons for refusing (wanting to do something else, not liking to touch feet) seem relatively minor compared to supporting a partner through a difficult pregnancy.

The girlfriend's reaction, while emotionally charged, appears to stem from feeling unsupported during a vulnerable time. Her frustration is understandable, though calling him names isn't ideal communication.

The author acknowledges doing ""a good amount"" for her, but this specific refusal seems to lack empathy for her current physical state and needs. In a partnership, especially during pregnancy, some personal preferences may need to be set aside occasionally for the partner's wellbeing.

This appears to be primarily about the author's unwillingness to provide basic comfort care during a challenging pregnancy, despite the relatively small sacrifice involved.

The clothing exchange system seems reasonable in theory, but there are clear communication and boundary issues. The baby mama's behavior of taking clothes and being difficult about returns is problematic. However, the author's response of calling her ""poor"" was unnecessarily cruel and escalated the conflict in a harmful way.

While the author may have been frustrated, using someone's economic status as an insult crosses a line into personal attack territory. This comment was likely to inflame the situation rather than resolve the practical issue of missing children's clothes.

The SO's decision to apologize was actually appropriate - he was trying to de-escalate a situation that affects his ability to co-parent effectively. His primary responsibility is to his children, which requires maintaining a workable relationship with their mother.

The author seems to be asking who's the ""asshole"" between themselves and their SO, but the real issue is the author's inappropriate comment. The SO was trying to manage a difficult co-parenting situation responsibly.

The author discovered that someone was spreading false rumors about having sex with his girlfriend. After confirming these were lies, he asked his girlfriend not to hang out with this person anymore. The girlfriend considers this controlling behavior.

Key considerations:
- The person spreading rumors is clearly engaging in harmful, false gossip that could damage both the relationship and the girlfriend's reputation
- The author has a legitimate concern about someone who is actively trying to harm their relationship through lies
- However, asking a partner to cut contact with someone, even for valid reasons, does involve some level of control over their social choices
- The girlfriend's autonomy and right to make her own decisions about friendships is important
- The request seems reasonable given the circumstances - this isn't jealousy over an innocent friendship, but a response to deliberate harmful behavior

The person spreading false rumors is clearly at fault for the underlying problem. The author's response seems reasonable given the situation - asking (not demanding) that his girlfriend avoid someone who is actively spreading lies about her is a fair boundary to request. The girlfriend may see it as controlling, but protecting a relationship from someone spreading malicious lies is generally reasonable.

The core issue stems from the rumor-spreader's behavior, and the author's response appears proportionate and reasonable.

The author presents valid concerns about PhD prospects based on personal experience, and it's natural to want to share that knowledge. However, several problematic patterns emerge:

1. **Projection over partnership**: The author is heavily projecting their own experience and regrets onto their girlfriend, assuming she'll have the same outcome despite different circumstances (engineering vs. their field, different person, different goals).

2. **Undermining autonomy**: While advice is reasonable, the author admits to actively trying to ""dissuade her from pursuing her goal"" - this crosses from supportive guidance into controlling behavior.

3. **Self-serving motivations**: The author explicitly states they want ""someone who can help me create the future I want"" and are ""scared of uncertainty."" They're prioritizing their financial comfort over her career aspirations.

4. **Dismissive assumptions**: Claiming she doesn't know what she's getting into, that her personality isn't suited for academia, and questioning her research abilities shows a lack of respect for her judgment and capabilities.

5. **Age-related pressure**: Repeatedly emphasizing that she's ""not that young anymore"" at 28 adds unnecessary pressure to an already significant decision.

The girlfriend appears to be making an informed choice about her career path. The author's concerns would be appropriate as one-time advice, but actively campaigning against her goals while admitting self-interested motives makes them primarily at fault.

The author has legitimate concerns - being consistently shut down when trying to make plans while watching their friend prioritize others who treat him poorly would understandably be hurtful. The pattern of rejection over 14 days is significant.

However, the friend's response reveals some concerning dynamics. His claim about being ""used to not talking to friends for quite a while"" directly contradicts their established communication pattern, suggesting either dishonesty or poor self-awareness. More problematically, when confronted with legitimate hurt feelings, he immediately accused the author of ""looking for something to justify cutting him out"" - this deflects from the actual issue and puts the author on the defensive rather than addressing their concerns.

The friend's response shows a lack of accountability and empathy. Instead of acknowledging how his actions affected the author or explaining his perspective constructively, he made the author the problem. This kind of deflection when someone expresses hurt is emotionally manipulative, whether intentional or not.

While the author could have potentially approached the conversation differently, expressing hurt feelings about being consistently rejected is reasonable and necessary for healthy relationships. The friend's defensive, guilt-inducing response rather than genuine engagement with the concerns raised is the primary issue here.

The friend is demonstrating poor friendship skills by consistently prioritizing others, being dishonest about communication patterns, and responding to valid concerns with manipulation tactics.

 So w...",Author,Other,0.8,0.5,False,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author spent $20 (a significant amount for their family during financial hardship) on a thoughtful Christmas gift for their best friend. The friend accepted the gift graciously, but then listed it for sale online as ""never been worn"" shortly after receiving it.

While technically a gift becomes the recipient's property to do with as they please, there are important social and emotional considerations here:

1. The friend knew about the family's financial struggles, making the $20 gift particularly meaningful
2. Selling a gift so quickly, especially one given during financial hardship, shows insensitivity
3. The ""never been worn"" caption suggests the friend had no intention of using or appreciating the gift
4. The author's hurt feelings are completely understandable given the circumstances

However, the author's desire to get the gift back is problematic. Once given, a gift belongs to the recipient. Asking for it back would likely damage the friendship and create awkwardness.

The friend's behavior shows poor judgment and insensitivity, but the author's proposed response (wanting the gift back) isn't appropriate either. A better approach would be addressing how the friend's actions made them feel.

Since both parties have some fault - the friend for insensitive behavior and the author for wanting to reclaim a gift - but the friend's actions are more significantly problematic.

The 15-year-old author is clearly in tremendous emotional distress, watching their family fall apart and feeling helpless. While calling their mother a ""mean bitch"" in front of her friend was hurtful and disrespectful, this appears to be a desperate cry for help from a child who feels unheard and is trying to prevent their family from completely breaking down.

The mother's behavior - emotionally abusing the father, calling him ""useless,"" not listening to her child's concerns, and creating a hostile home environment - is deeply problematic and harmful to the entire family.

The father's situation is also concerning, as he appears to be struggling with depression and unemployment, and has escalated to physical violence (slapping) during conflicts.

However, the core issue here is that this is a 15-year-old child caught in an extremely dysfunctional and emotionally abusive family situation. The adults in this situation have failed to create a safe, stable environment, and the child is reacting out of desperation and emotional overwhelm. While the author's outburst wasn't appropriate, it's understandable given their age, the trauma they're experiencing, and their feeling of powerlessness.

The primary responsibility lies with the adults who have created this toxic environment, not with the traumatized teenager trying to cope with it.

The author's concerns about his girlfriend's career prospects are understandable - he sees her struggling financially and wants to help. His suggestions about professional development programs come from a place of caring about her future.

However, the key issue is how he handled the conversation. When she expressed that she didn't want to pursue business-oriented careers or return to school, he ""snapped at her"" and told her she ""needs to be proactive and better herself."" This language is judgmental and dismissive of her autonomy to make her own career choices.

The girlfriend has legitimate reasons for her position - she may have specific career interests that don't align with business environments, or valid concerns about taking on more debt or time commitments. She's also currently employed and supporting herself, even if modestly.

While the author's intentions may have been good, his delivery was problematic. Telling someone they need to ""better herself"" implies she's currently inadequate, and snapping at her shows a lack of respect for her perspective and decision-making ability.

The girlfriend's reaction of calling him an asshole, while harsh, is understandable given how the conversation was handled.

The author has expressed discomfort with his fiancée attending a male strip show during her bachelorette party. He's communicated his boundaries clearly and calmly, asking reasonable questions about reciprocity (would she be okay if he went to a strip club). 

His fiancée and her sister are dismissing his concerns, calling him controlling and saying he's ""overreacting."" However, the author isn't trying to control the entire bachelorette party - he's expressed he's fine with all other activities including shows, magic shows, and talent shows. He's only uncomfortable with one specific activity.

In a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to express boundaries about what makes them uncomfortable, especially regarding activities involving nudity or sexual content. The fact that another groomsman shares similar concerns suggests this isn't an unreasonable position.

The fiancée's argument that ""it's different"" when applied to her situation but not his suggests some inconsistency in her reasoning. While strip shows and strip clubs may have different atmospheres, both involve people removing clothes for entertainment.

The 15-year-old is expressing legitimate concerns about living conditions at their mother's house that they describe as ""absolutely filthy"" and ""low-key hoarder"" level. These are serious health and safety concerns, not just teenage complaints about chores.

Key factors to consider:
- The child is old enough (15) to have valid input about their living situation
- Unsanitary living conditions can pose health risks
- The mother only cleans when told to do so, suggesting a pattern of neglect
- The distance from school creates additional practical problems
- The child has made efforts to help by cleaning, showing responsibility

The parents are prioritizing the abstract concept of ""spending time together"" over the child's actual wellbeing and practical needs. While maintaining relationships with both parents is generally important, it shouldn't come at the expense of basic living standards.

The mother appears to be struggling with maintaining her home, which could indicate underlying issues, but this doesn't negate the impact on her child. The father, while not directly responsible for the mother's housekeeping, is pushing the child into an unsuitable environment.

The author initially acted appropriately by complimenting the child's costume. However, when the child continued making noises and following them around, the author's response escalated inappropriately. While the author asked the child to leave multiple times and tried walking away (reasonable responses), they ultimately resorted to physical violence against a child.

The key issues are:
1. The author physically assaulted a minor
2. Even without knowing about the disability, hitting a child for being annoying or persistent is not justified
3. The author had other options available (seeking help from adults, continuing to walk away, etc.)

While the situation is tragic due to the misunderstanding about the child's disability, and while one can empathize with the author's frustration, physical violence against a child is never an appropriate response to annoying behavior. The disability adds context that makes this more heartbreaking, but even without that knowledge, the author's actions were wrong.

The child was simply being themselves and trying to interact, which is not blameworthy behavior. No adults appear to have been supervising or intervening, but their absence doesn't excuse the author's actions.

The author positioned themselves strategically at a spot that provides stability and comfort during a long commute. When the train reached the left-opening station, they assessed the situation and determined that with only 2 people getting off and a clear second lane available, moving wasn't necessary for passenger flow.

The other passenger's behavior was clearly problematic:
- He stared down the author in an intimidating manner
- He made a hostile verbal comment calling the author an ""asshole"" 
- Most importantly, he physically pushed the author

Even if we assume the author should have moved (which isn't clearly established given the available space and minimal passenger traffic), the other passenger's response was completely disproportionate and inappropriate. Physical contact and verbal abuse are never acceptable responses to perceived transit etiquette violations.

The author shows reasonable judgment by stating they do move when there are significant numbers of people getting on/off, suggesting they're generally considerate of others' needs while also looking out for their own comfort during a long commute.

While the author may have genuine concerns about their friend's maturity and life choices, there's a significant difference between expressing concern privately and supportively versus laughing at someone's happy news and immediately calling it a huge mistake. The friend was sharing something she was excited about, and the author's reaction was dismissive and judgmental from the start.

The author has clearly and repeatedly communicated a boundary - they don't want their partner to do this specific physical action to them. Despite multiple requests to stop, the partner continues the behavior ""over and over again."" This shows a pattern of disrespecting clearly stated boundaries.

The partner's response is particularly concerning. After the Valentine's Day incident where the author broke down, instead of showing genuine remorse and commitment to change, the partner:
1. Minimizes the issue (""it's such a small thing"")
2. Blames the author for being upset
3. Gets angry at the author for ""ruining Valentine's Day""
4. Shows no accountability for repeatedly ignoring consent

The partner's claim that he ""doesn't think before he acts"" is not a valid excuse for repeatedly violating someone's boundaries after being told multiple times to stop. This suggests either a lack of respect for the author's autonomy or an unwillingness to make the effort to remember and respect their wishes.

The author is not at fault for having boundaries, communicating them clearly, or being upset when those boundaries are repeatedly violated. They are also not wrong for questioning why their partner continues this behavior despite their clear objections.

The author admits to going through their boyfriend's phone without permission and making accusations of cheating, which was wrong. However, the boyfriend's response was completely disproportionate and illegal:

- Theft of personal property (phone, keys, cards, ID)
- Destruction of valuable property (throwing backpack with textbooks and laptop into river)
- Identity document theft (taking driver's license and social security card)

While the author's initial action of going through the phone was a violation of privacy and trust, it was a relatively minor wrongdoing compared to the boyfriend's response, which involved multiple serious crimes including assault, theft, and destruction of property.

The boyfriend's actions were criminal and dangerous, escalating a relationship conflict into physical violence and deliberate destruction of the author's essential belongings and documents.

The author witnessed what appeared to be sexual assault - a man touching and grinding on an extremely intoxicated woman without her consent or awareness. The author tried multiple approaches: first attempting to get the woman's attention by grabbing her hand (which was shaken off), then trying to physically remove her from the dangerous situation.

While the author's execution was imperfect - not accounting for the woman's 4-inch heels when pulling her down - their intentions were clearly to protect someone who appeared to be in a vulnerable and potentially dangerous situation. The woman was described as ""so out of it"" with her ""head slumped forward"" while being groped by a stranger.

The real fault lies with the man who was sexually assaulting an incapacitated person. He disappeared after the incident, which suggests he knew his behavior was wrong. The injured woman, while a victim of assault, was too intoxicated to consent to or even be aware of what was happening to her.

The author made a split-second decision to intervene in what they reasonably perceived as an assault in progress. While the outcome was unfortunate, failing to act could have resulted in much worse harm to the victim. The author's mistake was tactical, not moral.

The author seems to genuinely believe they're offering helpful advice about not dwelling on fears. However, their assessment fundamentally misunderstands the nature of women's safety concerns. What the author perceives as ""dwelling"" or ""choosing to be afraid"" is actually realistic risk assessment and necessary safety planning that women engage in daily.

The behaviors mentioned - being cautious walking alone, locking doors, being wary of concerning behavior from men, discussing safety strategies - are not irrational fears or ""dwelling on worst case scenarios."" These are evidence-based precautions. Women face significantly higher rates of sexual assault and harassment, and these conversations and behaviors are adaptive responses to real statistical risks.

The author's suggestion that his girlfriend and friends are ""choosing"" to be afraid dismisses the legitimate basis for their concerns and implies they could simply decide not to worry about genuine safety risks. This perspective, while perhaps well-intentioned, shows a lack of understanding of women's lived experiences and the reality of gendered violence.

The author was dealing with extraordinary trauma - losing their grandmother, nearly dying in a fire, becoming homeless, and losing their belongings and possibly a pet. They were clearly in crisis and made the difficult decision to attend school for normalcy and mental health reasons.

When friends repeatedly asked ""how are you doing"" despite knowing the full extent of the traumatic events, the author had a very mild outburst - slightly raising their voice to point out the obvious fact that they weren't okay.

The author's cousins made deeply offensive racist comments about potential children having a ""shit-like complexion."" This was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author then attempted to defuse the situation by making his own joke calling his girlfriend ""a little burnt,"" thinking this would help because they joke about race privately.

However, there's a crucial difference between private jokes between partners and public comments in front of hostile family members. The author's comment, while intended to lighten the mood, actually:
1. Validated and joined in with the racist remarks rather than shutting them down
2. Put his girlfriend in a more vulnerable position by having her own boyfriend make racial comments about her
3. Failed to defend her when she needed support most

The girlfriend's reaction was completely understandable - she was already facing hostility from his family, and instead of protection, her boyfriend added to the problem. Her explanation about colorism shows she was trying to help him understand why his comment was particularly harmful.

The author's defense that she makes jokes about his race too misses the point entirely. As she noted, the context and power dynamics make these situations very different. White people making jokes about people of color, especially in front of other white people who are already being racist, carries different weight and harm.

While the author's intention may have been good, his execution was poor and his response to her valid concerns was dismissive.

The author started by borrowing clothes without asking when she had nothing, which established a pattern of shared clothing use. However, there's a key difference in their situations - the author was in crisis with no belongings, while her friend had her own clothes but chose to take newly purchased items and favorite shoes without asking.

The author shows self-awareness about the initial boundary crossing and acknowledges feeling indebted to her friend's family for their help. She also demonstrates maturity by communicating her feelings rather than letting resentment build up.

The friend, while generous in housing the author during a crisis, began taking advantage of the informal arrangement by using new purchases and favorite items without permission, which goes beyond the original necessity-based sharing.

Both parties contributed to unclear boundaries around personal belongings, but the friend's behavior escalated beyond what was reasonable, especially taking new purchases and wearing out the author's favorite shoes.

The author's decision to communicate about the issue rather than stay silent shows responsibility, and her willingness to share if asked demonstrates reasonableness.

While the author initially set a precedent by borrowing without asking, the circumstances were exceptional, and the friend's subsequent behavior exceeded reasonable reciprocity.

The author has legitimate parental rights and has been consistently present in his daughter's life for 2+ years, seeing her 4-5 times weekly. The mother's restrictions appear excessive - not allowing any unsupervised time despite no history of harm or neglect. Her stated concerns (pool safety and forgetfulness about keys/wallet) seem manageable with proper precautions rather than justifying complete prohibition of independent parenting time.

However, filing for custody without any prior warning or discussion about legal action was a significant breach of communication and trust. While the author had exhausted conversations about visitation, he never indicated that legal action was the next step, making this feel deceptive.

The mother's behavior also appears problematic - completely preventing the father from exercising normal parental responsibilities and limiting the child's relationship with paternal family members seems controlling and potentially harmful to the child's development.

Both parties contributed to this escalation: the mother through excessive restrictions based on manageable concerns, and the father through secretive legal maneuvering rather than transparent communication about his intentions.

The child's separation anxiety mentioned actually supports the need for gradual, supervised transitions to more independent time with the father, rather than the current all-or-nothing approach.

The author had developed feelings for Jack but accepted he was in a relationship and never acted on those feelings. When Jack's best friend Chris asked her out, she politely declined and handled it maturely without creating awkwardness.

The key issue is what happened next. Jack repeatedly badgered the author for weeks, asking why she wasn't interested in Chris despite her giving polite excuses. This persistent questioning put her in an impossible position - she could either:
1. Continue making excuses (which wasn't working)
2. Tell the truth about her feelings
3. Make up a potentially hurtful lie about Chris

After weeks of pressure, she chose honesty, explicitly stating she wasn't expecting anything and that it was her personal issue to manage. Jack then became angry at her for telling him something he had persistently demanded to know.

Jack created this situation through his relentless questioning. The author was managing her feelings privately and appropriately until he forced the issue. His anger at receiving the honest answer he demanded is unreasonable - you can't badger someone for information and then blame them for providing it.

The author handled her feelings maturely throughout, never acted inappropriately, and only revealed them when pressured repeatedly. Jack's reaction shows he's at fault for creating this uncomfortable situation.

The old lady's reaction was disproportionate and inappropriate. She yelled at the author even after the situation was resolved, made sweeping generalizations about young people, and claimed seats ""aren't for young people"" - which contradicts basic public transit etiquette where seats are first-come, first-served with courtesy given to those who need them more.

The author handled the confrontation reasonably well by not escalating, offering to give up the seat if anyone actually needed it, and following advice to let it go when someone signaled them to stop engaging.

The author followed proper bus etiquette: waited before sitting, was willing to give up the seat if asked by someone who needed it, and didn't contribute to the conflict. The old lady was clearly out of line with her aggressive behavior and unreasonable demands.

The author has a legitimate concern - tenants leaving trash to pile up and rot inside the building is unsanitary and inconsiderate, especially when it forces the elderly landlord to clean up after them. This is a real problem that needed addressing.

However, the author's approach was problematic. The note was unnecessarily aggressive and profane (""fucking shameful,"" ""get your shit together""). While frustration is understandable, this hostile tone was likely to escalate conflict rather than solve the problem constructively. The author could have:
- Spoken to them directly first
- Written a firm but polite note
- Contacted the landlord to handle it officially
- Approached building management

The three tenants are also at fault for consistently leaving trash inside the building, creating unsanitary conditions, and forcing others (particularly the elderly landlord) to clean up after them. This behavior shows a lack of basic consideration for shared living spaces.

The boyfriend's actions were problematic in several ways:
1. He chose fake flowers without communicating this beforehand
2. When asked about it, he immediately justified the choice by citing the cost of real flowers
3. He essentially told his partner that $100 was too much to spend on them
4. He failed to consider cheaper alternatives that would have been more thoughtful

However, the author's response was also quite harsh:
1. ""Told him off"" suggests an aggressive confrontation
2. Made a dramatic statement about being ""worth less than $100""
3. Insisted on interpreting his unconscious motivations despite his denial

The boyfriend showed poor judgment and insensitivity, but the author escalated the conflict significantly. The boyfriend's main fault was thoughtlessness and poor communication about gift-giving expectations.

The author acknowledges they were ""kind of an asshole"" during the original falling out and takes responsibility for not reacting ""in a way a friend should have."" This shows self-awareness and growth.

The current dilemma involves whether to reveal their past identity to people they're reconnecting with unknowingly. Key considerations:

- The author has genuinely changed and is trying to be a better person
- The falling out was years ago and wasn't characterized as involving hatred
- These new friendships are providing needed social connection and personal growth
- No active deception is occurring - they're simply not volunteering past identity information
- The friends don't seem to harbor strong negative feelings (no hatred mentioned)

While there's an argument for transparency, the author isn't actively lying or manipulating anyone. They're participating authentically as their current self. The past conflict was mutual (a ""falling out""), and enough time has passed for personal growth.

The ethical concern about non-disclosure is valid, but given the circumstances - personal growth, time passed, mutual nature of original conflict, and the positive impact of these new relationships - this appears to be more about self-preservation and genuine fresh starts rather than malicious deception.

The author agreed to edit one final video for QW, then agreed to redo it when QW wasn't satisfied. During a mental health crisis, the author was listening to Spotify while not working on the video. QW then made insensitive comments comparing the author's situation to a bank loan and dismissing their mental health struggles.

While the author did have a commitment to complete the video, QW's response was completely inappropriate and lacking in basic human empathy. Comparing someone's mental health crisis to a bank loan, saying ""Will the bank even care? Will the loan be gone?"" and threatening what would happen if he were ""a shark loaner"" shows a disturbing lack of compassion.

The author was going through a legitimate mental health crisis and asked to be left alone. QW's response was to weaponize this vulnerability and apply pressure rather than showing any understanding or flexibility. Even when the author called out this behavior, QW continued to be dismissive about their mental state.

Yes, the author had made a commitment, but mental health crises are legitimate reasons that may require adjusting timelines. A decent person would respond with concern and offer support, not threats and comparisons to loan sharks.

The author seems genuinely respectful of others' musical preferences, explicitly stating they don't think their music is ""better"" and that people can ""do you."" They've tolerated listening to music they don't enjoy when with friends without being dismissive.

However, when the author made a simple suggestion to play ""Here Comes the Sun,"" their friends responded with ""you listen to some trash music"" and ""The Beatles is shit."" This goes beyond personal preference into actively insulting something the author enjoys.

The author's response about The Beatles being ""legendary"" seems like a reasonable defense when their taste was being attacked. They're making a distinction between personal preference (""I don't like Mozart"") and objective dismissal (""Mozart is bad""), which is actually quite mature reasoning.

The friends appear to be the ones escalating from preference to insult. They regularly play their music around the author (who tolerates it), but won't reciprocate even once, and then resort to calling the author's music ""trash"" and ""shit.""

The author is trying to balance multiple relationships and boundaries. Her partner was treated poorly by N and D during their shared living situation, with what sounds like unfair treatment and double standards. The author attempted to salvage the friendship with N under reasonable conditions - that N keep negative opinions about the partner private.

The key issue is the house boundary. The author's partner pays rent and has expressed discomfort with N being in their shared home. This is a reasonable boundary - people should feel comfortable and safe in their own living space, especially one they financially contribute to. The author is respecting this boundary while still trying to maintain the friendship outside the home.

The wider friend group calling the author an ""ass"" seems unfair, as they weren't involved in the original conflict and may not understand the full context. The author specifically kept them out of the drama to avoid forcing them to choose sides, which was considerate.

The author's wife made a mistake by not putting the headphones away despite knowing the dog chews wires, resulting in $199 headphones being destroyed. However, the author then deliberately chose to do nothing when they saw their wife's pain therapy device was at risk, essentially allowing it to be destroyed as retaliation.

While the wife was negligent with the headphones, the author's response was intentionally vindictive. They made a conscious decision to let their spouse's medical device be destroyed rather than taking 30 seconds to move it to safety. This escalated the situation from an accident/negligence to deliberate harm.

The 4 and 5-year-olds are wearing visibly soiled diapers and wanting to sit on the author's furniture. The author is uncomfortable with this and asks them to go home and put pants on.

The neighbor appears to be:
- Not properly toilet training age-appropriate children (4-5 years old should typically be toilet trained)
- Sending children in soiled diapers to someone else's home
- Using the author's house as free childcare without discussing boundaries
- Not addressing basic hygiene and clothing needs

- Appropriately setting boundaries about their furniture
- Considering the children's wellbeing (being teased at school)
- Questioning whether to address this directly

While it's generally good to mind one's own business, when someone regularly sends their children to your home, basic hygiene and respect for your property become legitimate concerns. The author has every right to set reasonable boundaries in their own home.

The core issue is whether the author should intervene in their mother's gift distribution and impose conditions on their son's inheritance.

**The mother's perspective**: She gave meaningful family heirlooms to her grandchildren at a family reunion. While the monetary values were unequal, this appears to have been unintentional - she genuinely didn't know the appraisal value. The gifts were given freely and completed.

**The son's perspective**: He received a legitimate gift from his grandmother and has every right to decide what to do with it. His grandmother made her choice about distribution, and he's the rightful owner.

**The author's intervention**: While well-intentioned in trying to create fairness, the author is essentially:
1. Overriding their mother's completed gift-giving decision
2. Imposing conditions on property that legally and morally belongs to their son
3. Making assumptions about what their mother would have wanted without consulting her

**Key considerations**: 
- The grandmother is still alive and could be consulted about her intentions
- Family heirlooms often have unequal monetary values but equal sentimental significance
- The son's financial situation vs. his sister's is irrelevant to inheritance rights

- There's established trust among all parties

- She trusts everyone involved

The author is being honest about a natural shift in their friendship dynamic. When physical attraction was masking personality incompatibility, they maintained the friendship despite feeling third-wheeled and unreciprocated romantic interest. Once that attraction faded due to the haircut, they could see more clearly that they simply don't connect well conversationally or have much in common.

Key points in the author's favor:
- They didn't criticize her appearance or make her feel bad about her choice
- They recognize she's a nice person, just not compatible with them
- They're planning to distance themselves rather than ghost her completely
- They're being self-reflective about their motivations
- Physical attraction naturally fluctuates and can't be forced

The friend hasn't done anything wrong - she's just being herself, made a personal style choice, and has been consistently friendly. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that no longer feels fulfilling, especially when it was built on unreciprocated romantic interest.

While the author's realization might feel shallow, it's actually healthy self-awareness. Friendships naturally evolve and sometimes fade when people realize they're not truly compatible.

The author admits to hiding a social interaction with a female friend from his girlfriend, even though the friend's boyfriend was present and there was no romantic interest. While he justifies this by citing his girlfriend's ""trust issues,"" deliberately concealing social activities from a partner is problematic behavior that undermines trust in the relationship.

However, the girlfriend's actions are significantly more serious - she violated his privacy by going through his text messages without permission, and more importantly, she had been actively cheating on him with a coworker. Cheating represents a fundamental betrayal of the relationship's commitment and trust.

While the author's decision to hide his social interaction was wrong and contributed to relationship problems, it pales in comparison to actual infidelity. The girlfriend's cheating is a much more serious breach of the relationship, and her invasion of privacy compounds the issue.

The author asked friends for honest feedback on their creative writing, explicitly requesting they be truthful even if it meant saying the work was awful. The friends gave positive feedback, calling it clear, easy to read, and original. However, when the author submitted the work, the professor gave harsh criticism that directly contradicted the friends' assessment, calling it clichéd, illogical, and confusing.

The key question is whether the friends deliberately lied or simply had different judgment/standards than the professor. Several factors suggest this may not have been intentional deception:

1. The friends are fellow students, not professional writers or teachers
2. They may genuinely have liked the work despite its flaws
3. Different readers can have legitimately different opinions about creative work
4. The professor's standards as a professional author would naturally be much higher

While the author feels betrayed and wants to end the friendship over this, the response seems disproportionate. The friends appear to have given their honest opinion based on their level of expertise. The author is essentially punishing them for not having the same critical eye as a professional.

The author's former friend made a move on his blackout drunk girlfriend while sober - this was clearly inappropriate behavior that violated both friendship boundaries and basic consent principles. The author has legitimate reasons for ending the friendship, including:

- Being willing to attend important events

The author received an expensive, high-quality gift ($1,000 worth of Waterford crystal) from a generous, wealthy aunt who had good intentions - she believed ""everyone needs to have a set of Waterford in their home."" This reflects traditional values about what constitutes proper household items for a married couple.

The author's feelings are understandable - they're newlyweds who needed practical items for daily use, and the crystal glasses sit unused because they're too fragile and high-maintenance for their lifestyle. The author even acknowledges the aunt's generosity and rationale.

However, the key issue is whether it's appropriate to be ""annoyed"" by a generous gift, even if it's not what you wanted or needed. The aunt gave what she genuinely believed was valuable and important, spending a significant amount of money with good intentions. She wasn't being malicious or thoughtless - she was following her own understanding of what makes a proper wedding gift.

While it's natural to have preferences about gifts, expressing annoyance about someone's generous gesture (even privately) crosses into ungrateful territory. The appropriate response would be appreciation for the thought and generosity, even if the gift doesn't match personal preferences.

The author is dealing with a tenant who is clearly neglecting and mistreating their dog - leaving it kenneled for hours with terrified barking, leaving it outside in cold weather after a shave with no shelter, and never walking or properly caring for it. The dog is now escaping through/over a gate.

The tenant is demanding the landlords replace the gate immediately and claiming they have responsibility for keeping the dog safe due to pet rent payments. The tenant has also made veiled threats about ""having a problem"" if the dog goes missing.

Key considerations:
- The pet rent and deposit are standard landlord protections against property damage, not insurance for pet care
- The dog's escape attempts are a direct result of the tenant's neglect and mistreatment
- A responsible pet owner would either properly supervise their dog, provide adequate shelter, or find alternative arrangements
- The tenant is trying to shift responsibility for their pet neglect onto the landlords
- While the landlords could choose to expedite the gate repair as a courtesy, they have no legal or moral obligation to do so given the circumstances

The tenant is entirely at fault for the dog's situation through neglect, and is now trying to blame the landlords for consequences of that neglect. The landlords have been responsive to legitimate maintenance issues but are rightfully drawing the line at being held responsible for the tenant's pet care failures.

The author repeatedly dismissed and invalidated the woman's perspective on makeup despite her clearly explaining her position.

The woman communicated clearly throughout and made a reasonable decision to end things when she realized they had incompatible views. She wasn't ""overreacting"" - she recognized that someone who repeatedly argues against something she enjoys and finds meaningful probably isn't a good match.

The author's final claim that he's ""not really superficial"" rings hollow given that he spent the entire conversation being judgmental about her makeup choices.

anyways for christmas my grandfather sent me 50 dollars and didnt send my sister anything, this happens every year and ever...",Author,Author,0.8,0.46153846153846156,False,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author (15-year-old) received $50 from their grandfather, while their half-sister (19) received nothing - a pattern that repeats annually. When the sister became upset about this, the author told her to ""get a grip"" since this happens every year.

Key considerations:
- The author's frustration is understandable given this is a recurring situation
- However, telling someone who is clearly hurt to ""get a grip"" lacks empathy and compassion
- The sister's pain about feeling excluded by a family member is valid, even if predictable
- The mother's response (splitting the money) may not be ideal, but she was trying to address family harmony after the author's insensitive comment
- The grandfather's consistent exclusion of the sister creates the underlying problem, but that's not what's being judged here

The author's response showed a lack of emotional intelligence and kindness toward their sister's genuine hurt feelings. While the frustration was understandable, the way it was expressed was unnecessarily harsh and dismissive of their sister's pain.

The sister's emotional response, while repetitive, is a natural reaction to feeling excluded. The mother was trying to manage a difficult family dynamic, though her solution may not be perfect.

The girlfriend wants to bring her dog to live with them, while the author believes their current lifestyle and living situation wouldn't be suitable for the dog's wellbeing. Let me analyze each perspective:

**The girlfriend's position:**
- She misses her dog and wants him with her
- Believes having the dog would motivate her to spend more time at home
- Wants to try it for a month

**The author's position:**
- Recognizes they both have hectic schedules with little time at home
- Notes they live in the city without a backyard
- Acknowledges the dog currently has a better situation with retired parents in the country
- Concerned that a ""trial month"" would become permanent regardless of how it goes

**Key considerations:**
- The dog's current situation appears objectively better (retired caretakers, country setting)
- Both people acknowledge having very busy lifestyles
- Urban apartment living without outdoor space is less ideal for most dogs
- The author shows genuine concern for the dog's welfare, not just personal convenience

The author appears to be making a responsible decision based on what's best for the dog, even though it's emotionally difficult for the girlfriend. While the girlfriend's feelings are understandable, wanting the dog doesn't automatically make it the right choice if they can't provide adequate care.

The author discovered their boyfriend's private interest in anime by snooping through his browsing history and online accounts when he left his laptop open. The boyfriend had kept this interest private due to social stigma, which proved justified given the author's reaction.

The core issues here:
1. The author violated their boyfriend's privacy by going through his personal accounts
2. The author is judging their partner based on harmful stereotypes about masculinity and maturity
3. The author is considering asking their partner to change or hide a harmless hobby to suit their preferences

The boyfriend did nothing wrong - he has every right to enjoy anime as a hobby, and his decision to keep it private was understandable given societal prejudices. His honesty when directly asked shows good character.

The author's reaction perpetuates toxic masculinity by equating enjoying animation with being less ""masculine"" or ""grown up."" Many adults enjoy various forms of entertainment and media. The author's loss of attraction based on a harmless hobby and their consideration of asking him to change reflects poorly on their acceptance of their partner as a whole person.

While people can't control their attractions, the underlying judgments here are problematic, and violating someone's privacy to discover information you then use against them is clearly wrong.

Now my girlfriend is mad at me and saying that it is a really racist name and I should chan...",Other,Author,0.8,0.8823529411764706,True,"I need to think through this situation carefully, considering the naming choice, cultural sensitivity, and the relationship dynamics.

The author named a cat ""Moo Shu"" after a Chinese dish. Let me consider the potential issues:

1. The name itself: ""Moo Shu"" (or Mu Shu) is indeed a legitimate Chinese dish name. However, using food names from other cultures for pets can be seen as trivializing or reducing that culture to consumable items.

2. Intent vs. Impact: The author likely didn't intend to be racist - they probably just thought it was a cute food-related name. However, impact matters regardless of intent.

3. The girlfriend's perspective: She's expressing that this feels racist to her, which suggests she sees it as culturally insensitive.

4. The response: The author seems defensive about changing it because ""the cat is already responding to it,"" but cats can learn new names relatively easily.

This appears to be a case where the author made a culturally insensitive choice without malicious intent, but when called out on it, is being somewhat resistant to feedback. The girlfriend is trying to educate about why this might be problematic. While not maliciously racist, the naming choice does reflect a lack of cultural awareness, and the resistance to changing it when the impact is explained is problematic.

The friend's behavior shows a clear pattern of disrespect:
- Has a known history of being late frequently
- Was specifically asked not to be late this time
- Called at 8:55 saying she was ""on her way"" when plans were for 9pm (indicating she hadn't even left yet)
- Arrived 40 minutes late
- Offered no apology upon arrival
- Made excuses rather than taking responsibility

The author's response appears reasonable:
- Set clear expectations upfront due to past issues
- Waited a full 40 minutes (showing patience)
- Only confronted the issue when no apology was offered
- Drew a boundary by leaving when the friend became defensive
- Acknowledges their own occasional lateness but notes the difference in degree (15 min vs 40 min) and approach (apologizing vs not apologizing)

The author's comparison of their own occasional 15-minute delays (with apologies) to the friend's 40-minute delay (without apology) shows reasonable self-awareness. The friend's response of making excuses rather than apologizing, especially given the established pattern and explicit request, demonstrates a lack of respect for the author's time.

The author set reasonable boundaries and responded appropriately to disrespectful behavior.

The author is facing workplace harassment and social judgment for dating someone in her professional field. She's being subjected to:
- Sexist comments about her appearance and behavior
- False rumors about trading sexual favors for workplace benefits
- Assumptions that she's a gold digger
- Pressure to quit her job she loves
- General workplace hostility based on gender stereotypes

The author has done nothing wrong. She:
- Excels at and loves her job
- Is financially independent
- Met someone naturally through mutual friends
- Is in a healthy relationship with someone who doesn't even work at her firm
- Is considering ending a good relationship solely due to others' inappropriate behavior

The people around her are clearly at fault for:
- Making sexist assumptions and comments
- Spreading malicious rumors
- Creating a hostile work environment
- Judging her personal relationships through a sexist lens
- Pressuring her to conform to traditional gender roles

The author is a victim of workplace harassment and societal sexism. She shouldn't have to choose between her career satisfaction and personal happiness because others can't behave professionally. The fault lies entirely with those creating this toxic environment through their prejudiced attitudes and inappropriate behavior.

The author wants to travel alone for 7 weeks after losing their father to cancer, which is a completely reasonable way to process grief and pursue personal growth. Their boyfriend is supportive and even plans to join them at the end for a holiday together. This shows a healthy, trusting relationship where both partners can maintain independence.

The friend, however, is making several problematic assumptions:
1. That wanting alone time means not loving your partner
2. That she knows the boyfriend's true feelings better than he does
3. That healthy relationships require doing everything together
4. She's creating unnecessary doubt and strain in both the romantic relationship and friendship

The author's instinct about non-codependent relationships being strongest is psychologically sound. Healthy relationships involve trust, support for individual growth, and the ability to maintain personal identity. The boyfriend's supportive response demonstrates maturity and security in their relationship.

The friend is overstepping boundaries by:
- Making unfounded claims about the author's feelings
- Presuming to know the boyfriend's hidden thoughts
- Pushing her own relationship philosophy without being asked
- Creating conflict where none existed

The author has done nothing wrong by wanting personal space to grieve and grow, especially with their partner's blessing.

Jim thinks my girlfriend has an attractive friend and he was asking my girlfriend to set him u...",Other,Everybody,0.8,0.7852028639618138,True,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The girlfriend created a no-win scenario by repeatedly insisting on honesty about a question that was clearly designed to seek reassurance rather than genuine feedback. When someone asks ""Am I prettier than [specific person]?"" while demanding honesty, they're putting their partner in an impossible position - especially when the honest answer isn't what they want to hear.

However, the author showed poor emotional intelligence by not recognizing this as a reassurance-seeking moment rather than a genuine request for comparative analysis. There were ways to handle this that could have been both honest and emotionally supportive, such as redirecting to what makes the girlfriend uniquely attractive to him or acknowledging the unfairness of the question.

The girlfriend bears primary responsibility for:
- Creating the trap by demanding honesty on a loaded question
- Punishing the author for giving exactly what she claimed to want
- Not taking responsibility for the consequences of her insistence

The author bears some responsibility for:
- Lacking the emotional awareness to navigate this sensitively
- Not recognizing the subtext of what was really being asked

This appears to be a case where both parties contributed to the conflict, though the girlfriend's actions were more problematic given that she explicitly demanded the response she then punished.

The friend-of-a-friend was questioning the need for LGBT youth centers and suggesting they're unnecessary segregation. While he has a right to express opinions, his comments showed a lack of understanding about why safe spaces exist for marginalized youth.

Your response - ""And what makes you think a straight guy's opinion on this subject matters?"" - was dismissive and reduced his ability to contribute to the conversation based solely on his sexual orientation. While I understand your frustration, this approach shut down dialogue rather than educating or explaining why his perspective might be limited by his lack of lived experience.

However, your reflection shows good self-awareness. You acknowledge that people should be able to express opinions regardless of sexuality, while also recognizing the value of centering marginalized voices and the importance of listening rather than speaking over those with direct experience.

The guy's reaction about ""reverse homophobia"" suggests he may have been more interested in being right than understanding, but your dismissive comment likely reinforced his defensiveness rather than opening his mind.

A more constructive approach might have been explaining why his lack of personal experience with LGBT discrimination limits his understanding, rather than dismissing his right to have an opinion entirely.

Both parties could have handled this better - you with less dismissiveness, him with more willingness to listen and learn.

The author lent their guitar to help a friend, and when it was damaged, they handled it reasonably by asking the friend to pay for repairs. The author gave clear advance notice about pickup times and deadlines, communicating their needs well ahead of time.

The friend, however, showed a pattern of irresponsibility:
- Failed to show up at the agreed noon time on Tuesday due to being ""busy having sex""
- Missed the rescheduled time due to class (which was predictable)
- On Wednesday, picked up the guitar but went home with it instead of delivering it as promised
- Was unavailable during the final window because of a last-minute essay

When the author expressed legitimate frustration about missing their guitar for vacation due to the friend's repeated failures, both the friend and girlfriend responded by calling the author rude and unreasonable rather than acknowledging the friend's mistakes.

The author's anger is completely justified - they were accommodating throughout, gave clear communication, and their friend repeatedly failed to follow through on commitments involving the author's property. The friend's defensive response rather than taking responsibility makes this even more problematic.

The author acted reasonably and responsibly throughout this situation, while the friend demonstrated poor reliability and accountability.

The author clearly owns the driveway and has the legal right to use it. They were generous in allowing the neighbor to use it for years when they didn't need it, and gave reasonable notice when they got a car and needed it back.

The neighbor has been repeatedly parking in the author's driveway without permission for months, forcing the author to pay for street parking. Despite multiple attempts to resolve this through communication and even involving the landlord, the neighbor has ignored the problem.

However, the author's current response - deliberately blocking the neighbor's car in what they acknowledge is an illegal ""road obstruction"" - crosses a line. While the frustration is completely understandable and the neighbor's behavior is clearly wrong, intentionally committing an illegal act as retaliation makes this problematic.

The neighbor is primarily at fault for:
- Repeatedly trespassing on private property
- Ignoring multiple requests to stop
- Causing financial harm through forced parking fees
- Being unresponsive to reasonable attempts at resolution

But the author bears some responsibility for choosing an illegal method of retaliation rather than pursuing legal remedies like towing or formal complaints.

This appears to be a case where both parties are engaging in wrongful behavior, even though the neighbor's actions are far more egregious and started the conflict.

Your sister has every right to make decisions about prison visits, especially given the serious nature of your father's crime. While he may have been hired to ""scare"" someone, he ultimately killed two people - regardless of their character, this was a life-altering violent act that resulted in a life sentence.

Your sister's back-and-forth feelings over decades are completely understandable given the complexity of loving a parent who committed murder. The fact that she initially agreed to the visit plan but changed her mind doesn't make her wrong - she's allowed to reconsider difficult emotional decisions.

Most importantly, as a parent, she has the absolute right and responsibility to decide what's appropriate for her children, even if they express love for their grandfather. Prison visits involving a family member convicted of murder are significant decisions that only she can make for her kids.

Your anger and disappointment are understandable - you want family unity and for your father to see everyone. However, trying to pressure or guilt your sister into a prison visit she's uncomfortable with crosses a line. Her boundaries around this traumatic family situation need to be respected.

The ""worst knock out drag out fight"" suggests this conflict escalated beyond reasonable discussion into something harmful to your relationship.

The author clearly committed a serious betrayal by cheating with three people, despite knowing their ex had PTSD from previous infidelity and explicitly promising this wouldn't be an issue. This was a significant breach of trust and caused substantial harm.

However, the ex's response, while understandable given the trauma, included calling the author ""a bad person,"" saying other ""angry and hurtful words,"" and then blocking contact for two months. While the pain and anger were justified, some of the verbal attacks may have crossed into unnecessarily cruel territory.

The current conflict centers on whether the author should meet to talk for the ex's mental health. The author has the right to set boundaries about contact, especially after being subjected to hurtful words and having contact cut off for months. The ex's statement about feeling suicidal adds complexity, but the author is correct that they're not responsible for managing their ex's mental health at this point.

The author initiated the chain of events through infidelity, but both parties contributed to the escalation of conflict. The author through the initial betrayal, and the ex through some of the harsh response (though this was reactive to being deeply hurt).

This appears to be a situation where both parties bear some responsibility - the author primarily for the cheating, and both for how the aftermath was handled.

The author (Bison) is experiencing jealousy and discomfort about his girlfriend's renewed friendship with her ex. Let me analyze each party's behavior:

**The Author's actions:**
- Feeling jealous but trying to be understanding
- Communicating his concerns with his girlfriend
- Attempting to interact with the ex despite discomfort
- Seeking advice rather than making demands or ultimatums

**The Girlfriend's actions:**
- Being transparent about the ex having feelings
- Reassuring the author that nothing will happen
- Maintaining boundaries while preserving the friendship

- Being friendly and inclusive toward the author
- Bringing gifts for both the girlfriend and author
- Attempting to maintain a positive dynamic

This appears to be a complex emotional situation where everyone is trying to navigate difficult feelings. The author is handling his jealousy maturely by communicating rather than being controlling. The girlfriend is being honest and reassuring. The ex seems to be making genuine efforts to be inclusive and friendly.

The author's concerns about being a rebound are understandable given the timeline, but there's no evidence of actual wrongdoing by anyone involved. This seems like a normal relationship challenge that requires communication and trust-building rather than assigning fault.

The hotel made a clear mistake - they documented the pet fee but failed to record the complimentary gift arrangement that was promised. This was genuinely disappointing, especially since you had specifically called ahead to arrange this surprise.

The author is a 17-year-old trying to lose weight and wants family support by having healthier food options in the house. They're also concerned about their younger brothers' health and potential bullying.

The author acknowledges several key points:
- They admit it's ""my own fault for just not eating right""
- They recognize they're ""not very in control of my own eating""
- They're ""pretty picky when it comes to healthy food""
- They don't have a job and can't buy food for the family
- They chose to resume drinking sweet tea when tempted

The parents have budget constraints and cite cost concerns about healthier food. While the author suggests reallocating the junk food budget, they don't seem to fully grasp the financial realities their parents face in feeding a family of five.

The author is asking for support but expecting others to change their purchasing and eating habits to accommodate their personal weight loss goals. While their concern for their brothers is admirable, trying to control the entire household's food environment when they're not contributing financially puts them in a difficult position.

The parents could potentially be more supportive, but they're managing a household budget and feeding multiple people with different needs and preferences.

- The girlfriend chose to do intermittent fasting, which is her personal decision
- While asking for some support is reasonable, completely restricting cooking in shared living space for 16 hours daily significantly impacts the partner's lifestyle
- The author has been trying to be supportive but is reasonably questioning the extent of accommodation expected
- Both people have legitimate needs - her diet goals and his normal eating patterns

The girlfriend's initial request was reasonable, but extending it to ban all cooking seems excessive given they share the space. However, the author isn't being unreasonable in questioning this boundary while still trying to be supportive.

The core issue is an imbalance in effort and initiative within the friend group. You and Amy consistently take on all the planning responsibilities - from suggesting hangouts to choosing times, places, and activities - while Josh and Kate remain passive participants who contribute little beyond ""idk"" or ""whatever works.""

When you finally asked them to plan something, they essentially delegated the actual decision-making back to you by providing a list of 12 restaurants and saying ""you pick."" This isn't really planning - it's just shifting the burden while maintaining plausible deniability. Then when Amy tried to make a choice (Chili's), Josh got upset and rejected it, despite having given you the options to choose from.

Your frustration is completely understandable. Friendship should involve mutual effort, and it's exhausting to always be the one initiating and organizing. While your sarcastic comment (""I guess that was too hard for y'all"") was a bit sharp, it came from legitimate frustration after repeatedly being let down.

Josh and Kate seem to want the benefits of planned social activities without putting in any of the work. Their reaction when asked to actually plan something - essentially refusing to make decisions and then getting mad at the choices made - shows they're not willing to step up even when directly asked.

The author has been respectful of his girlfriend's boundaries around sex frequency (once per week vs his preference for more). He's also been tolerant of her regular solo toy use (3-4x per week) even though he'd prefer that energy be directed toward their shared intimacy.

His girlfriend doesn't like his porn use but hasn't explicitly asked him to stop, and he continues watching it. When he purchased a sex doll for personal use, she demanded he get rid of it.

The core issue here is a double standard. Both partners are using aids for solo sexual activity - she uses vibrators/dildos regularly, and he uses porn and now a sex doll. Her objection to his sex doll while maintaining her own solo practices with toys creates an inconsistent boundary system.

The author appears to have made reasonable attempts to include his girlfriend (asking to use toys together, which she declined) and has generally respected her stated preferences about sex frequency. His purchase of the sex doll seems to be a response to the mismatch in their sexual needs and her unavailability for compromise on frequency or shared toy use.

While couples should ideally discuss major purchases that affect their relationship, the girlfriend's demand seems hypocritical given her own regular use of sex toys for solo activities.

The girlfriend is primarily at fault for applying inconsistent standards to their respective solo sexual activities.

The author offered their friend a spare room as temporary help during a difficult time. This was a generous gesture to help someone in need. However, the friend brought two strangers into the author's home without asking permission first.

Key considerations:
- The author has legitimate concerns about strangers in their home, especially with their mother, wife, and two children living there
- Basic courtesy and respect dictate that houseguests should ask before bringing additional people over
- The friend violated the implicit boundaries of the arrangement by not communicating about bringing guests
- The author has every right to set rules about who can be in their own home
- However, the ""no girls rule"" seems unnecessarily gendered - the issue isn't that they're female, but that they're unauthorized strangers

The friend is primarily at fault for bringing people over without permission, which is a basic violation of houseguest etiquette. The author's reaction is understandable given the circumstances, though the gendered nature of the rule is somewhat problematic when the real issue is about getting permission for any guests.

The friend should have asked first, and the author has every right to establish boundaries in their own home where their family lives.

The author lied out of spite and anger, deliberately trying to hurt someone he cared about. This was a manipulative action intended to cause emotional pain. However, his girlfriend's response - actually sleeping with someone else based on what she believed was his infidelity - was her own choice and reaction to the lie.

The core issue is that the author created a false reality through his lie, which directly influenced his girlfriend's decision to sleep with someone else. She made her choice based on information he knew to be false. While she could have chosen differently, her action was a direct consequence of his deception.

The girlfriend isn't blameless - she chose to respond to perceived infidelity with actual infidelity rather than communication or ending the relationship. However, her action was reactive to what she believed was his betrayal.

The author bears primary responsibility because:
1. He initiated the deception with malicious intent
2. His lie directly caused the situation he's now upset about
3. He created the false premise that led to her actions

This is a case where one person's deliberate deception set in motion the events that followed.

The friend's behavior crosses clear boundaries multiple times:
- Attempted to kiss the author after being told they only wanted friendship
- Asked inappropriate sexual questions about the author's body
- Continued making unwanted advances and using demeaning language (""little bitch"")
- Persisted with this behavior even after it was clearly unwelcome

The author handled this appropriately by:
- Being supportive when the friend came out
- Clearly communicating they only wanted friendship
- Eventually cutting contact when the behavior continued

While the author could have been more direct earlier about how uncomfortable the behavior made them, they were only 15 and dealing with an older friend who wasn't respecting boundaries. The author's initial tolerance and later decision to end the friendship were reasonable responses to persistent unwanted advances.

The friend is clearly at fault for not respecting the author's clearly stated boundaries and continuing inappropriate behavior despite obvious discomfort from both the author and their friend group.

The author has legitimate concerns about explicit rap music being played loudly around their 8-year-old daughter. They've communicated this boundary clearly and repeatedly over 4 months. The husband acknowledges the request each time but continues the same behavior, showing a pattern of disrespecting agreed-upon boundaries.

While the author's frustration has escalated to threats about the speaker and using profanity, this appears to be a natural result of months of being ignored on a reasonable parenting concern. The author even notes they ""don't ask nicely anymore"" because they're fed up - indicating they did start with polite requests.

The husband's ""okay jeez!"" response suggests he views this as the author overreacting, rather than recognizing he's repeatedly broken his word about something important to his partner and their child's environment.

The core issue isn't about musical preferences - it's about one parent repeatedly ignoring the other's concerns about age-appropriate content for their child, despite multiple conversations and agreements to change the behavior.

The author's escalated response, while not ideal, is understandable given the prolonged pattern of being dismissed on a legitimate parenting issue.

The author describes a pattern of abusive behavior from their father including:
- Consistent verbal abuse and put-downs
- Physical violence toward the mother
- Emotional neglect (forgetting birthdays, never praising)
- Controlling behavior and unrealistic expectations
- Public humiliation in the author's own home

The author acknowledges their father's difficult childhood but recognizes it doesn't excuse the abuse. The final incident where the father publicly berated and insulted the author in their own home in front of their spouse was clearly the breaking point.

The author's response - telling their father to leave and cutting contact - is a reasonable boundary-setting action in response to years of documented abuse. While the language used was harsh, it came after what appears to be a lifetime of mistreatment and was triggered by being publicly humiliated in their own home.

The author is questioning whether they're wrong for protecting themselves and their family from continued abuse, which suggests they're being thoughtful about this decision rather than acting impulsively or maliciously.

Setting boundaries with abusive family members, even parents, is not only acceptable but often necessary for one's mental health and well-being.

The ""Unwanted Cards"" bin was clearly intended as a community resource where people could drop off cards they didn't want and others could take what they needed. The system worked on the principle that cards would go into the bin first, then people could look through and take what they wanted.

Ned was subverting this system by:
1. Removing ALL cards from the bin to sort through privately
2. Only returning lands/tokens while keeping everything else
3. Intercepting new donations before they even reached the bin
4. Essentially claiming ownership of cards that were meant for community sharing

This behavior was selfish and against the spirit of the community resource. However, the author's response - grabbing cards and walking off - was also problematic. While understandable given the frustration, it was essentially theft (taking cards that Ned had already sorted through) and escalated the conflict rather than addressing it constructively.

A better approach would have been to involve PAX staff or organizers, or to simply call out the unfair behavior publicly. Two wrongs don't make a right, even when the first wrong was more egregious.

Both parties acted inappropriately, though Ned's behavior was the initial and more significant violation of community norms.

The daughter has found a harmless creative outlet that brings her joy and allows her to practice dedication and persistence - valuable life skills. The specific activities (facial movements, body contortions) are unusual but not inherently harmful, and the author acknowledges this isn't actually ""a big deal.""

The author's objections seem primarily aesthetic (""it's ugly,"" ""doesn't look nice"") rather than based on genuine harm. While concern about joint damage from unnatural movements could be valid, this isn't mentioned as the primary issue - the focus is on appearance and personal irritation.

Threatening punishment for a child engaging in harmless self-expression because the parent finds it aesthetically displeasing is problematic. The sister's point about stifling creativity has merit. The author is essentially trying to control their daughter's bodily autonomy over personal preferences rather than safety concerns.

The daughter's increased defiance when told to stop is a natural response to what she likely perceives as arbitrary control. Children often push back when restrictions feel unfair or unexplained.

While parents certainly have the right to set boundaries, those boundaries should ideally serve the child's wellbeing rather than the parent's aesthetic preferences. The author could redirect this energy more constructively without punitive measures.

The author has made genuine efforts to welcome Abby into their social circle, including organizing double dates and inviting her to birthday celebrations. Abby's behavior has been consistently problematic - interrupting conversations, one-upping comments, dismissing the author's interests, physically snatching drinks from her hand, calling her a ""bitch"" behind her back, and generally being rude and self-centered.

The author isn't trying to break up David and Abby, isn't badmouthing Abby to David, and isn't preventing Charles from seeing his brother. She's simply choosing not to subject herself to someone who treats her poorly. This is a reasonable boundary to set.

David's happiness with Abby doesn't obligate the author to endure mistreatment. The author has tried multiple times to make things work and has been met with increasingly worse behavior. Choosing to limit exposure to someone who is consistently rude and disrespectful is self-care, not causing problems.

The peer's behavior of walking around class unprompted, talking about depression to multiple people, does seem attention-seeking and disruptive to the learning environment. However, the author's response was extremely harsh and inappropriate.

While the peer's approach was problematic, they may have been genuinely struggling with mental health issues and simply didn't know how to seek help appropriately. Depression can manifest in ways that seem attention-seeking but stem from real distress.

The author's response - calling someone an ""attention whore"" and saying no one cares about them - was cruel and potentially harmful to someone who may already be struggling. This kind of public humiliation could worsen someone's mental state significantly.

The peer bears some responsibility for disrupting class and handling their situation inappropriately, but the author's response was disproportionately harsh and potentially damaging. A better approach would have been to ignore the behavior, speak privately to the person later, or alert a teacher if it was truly disruptive.

The author is dealing with complex trauma and attachment issues from an abusive background, where their ex was the first person to show them love. They're working with a therapist who recommended finding someone trustworthy to discuss these feelings with. The author chose their current girlfriend, someone they've known for years and trust deeply.

The author's intentions were good - following therapeutic advice, being honest with their partner, and not wanting to hide anything. However, the execution was problematic. Telling your current girlfriend that you still love your ex, even with context about trauma and attachment disorders, is something that requires extremely careful consideration and likely professional guidance on how to approach.

The girlfriend's reaction - being taken aback, going quiet, and then distancing herself - is completely understandable. Most people would struggle to hear their partner say they still love an ex, regardless of the psychological context.

While the author's mental health struggles and desire for honesty are valid, they made a significant error in judgment. There's a difference between being open about ongoing healing from past trauma and directly stating you still love an ex to your current partner. This could have been handled through continued therapy, support groups, or other trusted friends first.

The girlfriend isn't at fault for having a normal emotional response to difficult information. The author, despite good intentions, chose an approach that was likely to cause harm to their current relationship.

- Showing pepper spray as a threat over a seating dispute
- Threatening to pepper spray someone's throat for snoring/spreading out
- Deliberately positioning themselves to ""super squish"" the man's body
- Generally escalating conflicts rather than seeking reasonable solutions

The man was inconsiderate and created the initial problem, but threatening someone with pepper spray over seating issues and deliberately causing physical discomfort crosses ethical and potentially legal lines. The author's friend tried to de-escalate and showed the situation could have been handled more diplomatically.

The author established a pattern of regular intimate contact (2-4 times a week) over what appears to be several weeks or months, which naturally could lead someone to develop deeper feelings. While the author assumed it was casual, they never explicitly communicated this assumption to Anna, despite knowing they would only be in town for 3 months.

The timing of ending things on Valentine's Day, while perhaps coincidental, was particularly hurtful. More importantly, when the author decided to end the physical relationship, they were unprepared to explain their reasoning clearly, leaving Anna confused and hurt without proper closure.

However, this appears to be a case of miscommunication and poor timing rather than malicious intent. The author recognized Anna's hurt feelings and felt remorse. Anna also bears some responsibility for not communicating her developing feelings or asking about the nature of their relationship.

Jack is clearly at fault for cheating on his wife, regardless of the circumstances. Marriage creates obligations that he's violating through his ongoing affair with Hannah.

Hannah is also at fault for knowingly engaging in an affair with a married man. Even if she had feelings for Jack first, she chose to act on them while he was married to someone else.

Jasmine, while described as ""emotionally immature and selfish,"" doesn't appear to have done anything that would justify being cheated on. Yes, she may have pursued Jack aggressively and caused social friction, but these relationship dynamics don't excuse infidelity. People enter relationships for various reasons and with different levels of awareness about their partner's feelings for others.

The author seems to be seeking validation for the view that Jasmine ""set herself up"" for being cheated on, but this perspective essentially blames the victim of infidelity. While Jasmine may have made poor relationship choices, she didn't deserve to be betrayed by her spouse.

The situation involves multiple people making poor choices, but the core issue is the affair between two people who are betraying the trust of a third person in their social circle.

The author has clearly communicated their dietary preferences and health goals to their mother repeatedly. They've specifically told her ""hundreds"" of times that they don't like Chex Mix, yet she continues to give it to them weekly. The author has also explained they don't want junk food and will just give it away, but the mother continues this pattern.

The author has tried multiple approaches - telling her they don't need it, saying they'll give it away, and expressing their preferences for healthier options like chicken and vegetables. When communication failed, they resorted to throwing the unwanted food away rather than consuming it and potentially undermining their health progress.

The mother's behavior could stem from good intentions (wanting to care for her child) or difficulty with an empty nest, but the author mentions she has ""extremely bad memory,"" which suggests this may not be intentional sabotage. However, regardless of intent, continuing to give someone food they've repeatedly said they don't want after hundreds of conversations shows a lack of respect for their clearly stated boundaries.

The author describes a long history of feeling abandoned by their ex-stepdad after he remarried when they were 15. They felt ""banished"" from his home and experienced minimal contact over the years, with the author feeling used during their last meaningful interaction.

At the brother's wedding, the author gave a brief, polite interaction - a quick hug and short conversation about some old documents. This seems like appropriate behavior given their distant relationship.

However, the ex-stepdad then initiated a Facebook conversation that appears to have escalated into conflict (though the specific content isn't fully visible in the description). The author mentions this as a ""social media back and forth"" that happened ""shortly after the wedding.""

The ex-stepdad seems to be the one who:
1. Initially distanced himself from the author after remarrying
2. Made minimal effort to maintain the relationship over the years
3. Initiated the problematic social media interaction after what seemed like a civil encounter at the wedding

The author's behavior at the wedding appears restrained and appropriate given the circumstances. They didn't create drama at their brother's wedding and kept the interaction brief but civil.

The stalker's behavior is clearly criminal - sending unwanted packages, ignoring repeated requests to stop, continuing harassment after being blocked, and making threats. This person is absolutely at fault for initiating and escalating the situation.

However, the author's response crossed a significant line. While the frustration with police inaction is understandable, the author committed multiple crimes:
- Stalking (following someone home)
- Vandalism/destruction of property (smashing windows)
- Potentially intimidation/harassment

The author had legal alternatives available:
- Continuing to work with police
- Consulting with a lawyer about a restraining order
- Documenting evidence for stronger legal action
- Involving other authorities if local police were unresponsive

The girlfriend appears to have handled this appropriately by repeatedly telling the harasser to stop, blocking him, and filing a police report.

While the stalker's behavior was the root cause and more serious in terms of ongoing harassment, the author chose to respond with criminal acts rather than pursuing legal remedies. Two wrongs don't make a right, and vigilante justice creates additional problems and legal liability.

The author is facing a dilemma between lending their car to help pick up their uncle in snowy conditions versus protecting their first car from potential damage. Let me analyze the key factors:

**Safety considerations:**
- The author's 2000 Corolla has fully functioning safety features
- The Passat has non-working seatbelts (major safety hazard)
- The Acura Legend lacks airbags
- Snowy driving conditions in the Pacific Northwest create additional risks

**The author's position:**
- Admits their primary concern is protecting their car from damage
- Safety concerns are secondary to them
- This is their first car, making it emotionally significant

**The broader context:**
- This involves picking up a family member (uncle) from the airport
- The weather conditions make this a potentially dangerous trip
- The family needs reliable, safe transportation

While it's natural to want to protect one's first car, prioritizing the vehicle's condition over family safety in hazardous driving conditions is problematic. The author acknowledges that safety should come first but admits it doesn't for them. In a family emergency or important situation like this, with genuinely unsafe alternative vehicles, the responsible choice would be to prioritize safety over potential cosmetic damage.

The author is being honest about their priorities, but those priorities are misplaced given the circumstances.

The author is angry about their brother's decision to marry his girlfriend primarily for immigration convenience, with their grandparents financially supporting the couple. Let me analyze the key issues:

**The brother's choices:** Getting married mainly for easier European immigration, accepting ongoing financial support from elderly grandparents for living expenses, and making major life decisions without demonstrating financial independence are questionable choices that could reasonably concern family members.

**The author's response:** While the underlying concerns about financial dependency and marriage motivations are valid, the author's intense anger, consideration of skipping the wedding, and admitted personal dislike of both the brother and girlfriend suggest their reaction may be disproportionate. Family members can disagree with decisions while still showing basic support.

**Family dynamics:** The grandparents appear willing to provide support, and the mother is supportive of the marriage. The author seems to be taking on a role of family financial guardian that may not be theirs to assume.

**The core issue:** This appears to be more about different values regarding financial independence and family support rather than clear wrongdoing by any party.

The author has legitimate concerns but is expressing them in a way that could damage family relationships unnecessarily. The brother's choices, while potentially unwise, aren't inherently wrong if the grandparents are willing participants.

The ...",Author,Author,0.8,0.6956521739130435,False,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the complex dynamics of grief, family obligations, and emotional responses.

The author is experiencing what appears to be emotional numbness or detachment regarding their brother's death. This could be a form of grief response, a psychological defense mechanism, or potentially indicative of other underlying factors. Importantly, people process grief very differently, and there's no ""correct"" way to feel about loss.

However, the core issue isn't about the author's emotional response - it's about their decision regarding the funeral and how they're handling family expectations during a time of collective grief.

The author's family members are dealing with profound loss and are seeking support and unity during this tragic time. Funerals serve important social and psychological functions beyond just honoring the deceased - they provide closure, community support, and family bonding during crisis.

While the author cannot control their emotional response, they do have control over their actions and choices. The decision to not attend their brother's funeral, particularly when other family members are explicitly asking for their presence during this difficult time, shows a lack of consideration for their family's needs and the social obligations that come with family relationships.

The author's reasoning (""I have a lot going on"") appears insufficient given the gravity of the situation - a sibling's death is typically considered one of life's most significant events that would warrant rearranging other commitments.

The author waited a reasonable amount of time (8 months) before giving away what was originally the ex-fiancé's TV to its rightful owner. The friend had effectively abandoned his belongings by moving out without notice and leaving items for such an extended period.

The friend's expectation that he could use the author's home as indefinite free storage without communication is unreasonable. His angry response when consequences occurred shows a sense of entitlement. The girlfriend's aggressive confrontation at the author's home was also inappropriate.

While one could argue the author might have made one final attempt to contact the friend before giving away the TV, this seems like a minor consideration given the friend's pattern of poor communication and the fact that the TV was returned to its original owner.

Ben's reaction, while understandable from an emotional standpoint, shows a lack of maturity and support for his friend's ambitions. Saying the author could ""get an internship any time"" and would ""just be pouring coffee"" dismisses the real value of early career experience, networking, and professional development.

The author handled the situation appropriately by:
- Only committing to summer plans after believing the internship was off the table
- Immediately informing Ben when the situation changed

The author's concerns about cultural appropriation have some validity - Jenn is indeed picking and choosing elements from Hindu/Indian wedding traditions without deep understanding of their significance. However, the key issue here is how the author handled the situation.

Jenn's connection to Indian culture is complex. As an adoptee who was separated from her birth culture at age 2, her desire to reconnect is understandable, even if her approach seems superficial. Her adoptive parents did make some efforts to maintain cultural connections, and this wedding may represent her attempt to explore her heritage more deeply.

The author's approach was problematic in several ways:
1. They made a blanket statement that Jenn ""shouldn't have an Indian wedding"" rather than offering to help her understand the traditions better
2. They dismissed Jenn's adoptee experience and her genuine desire for cultural connection
3. Instead of being a cultural bridge (which Jenn was clearly seeking), they became a gatekeeper
4. They could have offered to educate rather than simply criticize

While the author's feelings about cultural appropriation are valid, their response lacked empathy for Jenn's unique position as an adoptee trying to reconnect with her birth culture.

The author and their friends had good intentions - they wanted to help their depressed friend who had been struggling with unrequited feelings for months. However, they chose to intervene by directly messaging the girl to ask her to DM their friend, which crossed boundaries and likely made the girl uncomfortable. This kind of intervention, while well-meaning, can feel manipulative or pressuring to the recipient and often backfires.

The author acknowledges this wasn't the smartest approach and shows genuine remorse about the outcome. They were trying to help a friend in emotional distress, but their method was misguided rather than malicious.

The girl's upset reaction is understandable - being approached by a group to pressure her into contacting someone she may not be interested in would naturally make her uncomfortable.

The friend who liked the girl isn't really at fault for having feelings, though relying on others to intervene rather than handling it himself wasn't ideal.

This seems like a case of good intentions with poor execution, where the author and friends made an error in judgment but weren't acting with bad intent. The negative outcome was more due to the inappropriate method than malicious behavior.

The author has been clear and consistent about his boundaries from the beginning - he explicitly stated he's not gay and nothing would happen between them. Despite this, P. has repeatedly:

1. Sent inappropriate romantic/sexual texts after being told no
2. Accused the author of homophobia when boundaries were enforced
3. Used guilt manipulation about being ""alone and unaccepted""
4. Continued pursuing the author even after he got into a relationship
5. Made public displays that embarrassed the author in front of his girlfriend and strangers
6. Physically violated boundaries with unwanted intimate contact and sexual language

The author gave P. multiple chances, was supportive during his coming out, tried to be kind in his rejections, and even gave him a second chance after the initial inappropriate behavior. P. has consistently ignored clear boundaries and escalated his behavior.

The author's consideration of going no-contact is completely reasonable given the pattern of boundary violations and manipulation. This isn't about P. being gay - it's about P. refusing to respect clearly communicated boundaries and continuing unwanted romantic/sexual pursuit.

P. is entirely at fault for his inappropriate behavior, manipulation tactics, and refusal to respect the author's clearly stated boundaries and relationship status.

The author witnessed an SUV accident where the driver was clearly intoxicated (holding a beer can, slurring words, couldn't stand straight). The driver then asked the author to lie and claim he was driving to help him avoid a DUI charge. When the author refused to lie, the driver asked again, showing his intent to evade responsibility for drunk driving.

The author then helped the intoxicated driver leave the scene of an accident by giving him a ride away from the scene. This constitutes:

1. **Aiding someone in fleeing the scene of an accident** - Even though no one else was hit, leaving the scene of any accident can be illegal
2. **Helping someone evade a DUI charge** - The author knew the person was drunk and had been driving, yet helped them avoid facing consequences
3. **Potentially obstructing justice** - By removing the intoxicated driver from the scene before police arrived
4. **Enabling dangerous behavior** - Drunk drivers who face no consequences are more likely to drive drunk again

While the author's initial actions were good (stopping to help, calling 911, refusing to lie), the decision to drive the drunk driver away from the scene was problematic. The author became complicit in helping someone evade responsibility for drunk driving, which puts future innocent people at risk.

The drunk driver is obviously at fault for driving under the influence, but the author shares fault for the decision to help him flee.

The girlfriend asked direct questions about her appearance and how she could improve her looks. The author tried to avoid the topic initially but was pressed for answers. When directly asked, he gave honest responses that were hurtful.

While honesty in relationships is generally valued, there's a significant difference between being truthful and being unnecessarily harsh. Rating your partner as ""5/10"" and telling them they can't improve their looks crosses the line from honesty into cruelty. The author seems to lack emotional intelligence and tact in how he communicated.

However, the girlfriend also bears some responsibility. She persistently pushed for answers after the author tried to redirect the conversation, essentially forcing him into a situation where any honest response about her appearance would likely be hurtful. When someone tries to avoid a topic, continuing to press often leads to outcomes nobody wants.

The author could have found more tactful ways to be honest or set better boundaries about not wanting to discuss physical ratings. The girlfriend could have recognized the author's attempts to avoid the topic and respected that boundary rather than pushing for potentially hurtful answers.

Both parties contributed to this painful outcome through poor communication choices.

The key facts are:
- You had pre-approved vacation time for inflexible dates (Black Friday deal)
- Your boss approved this time knowing you needed to unwind after being swamped
- An unexpected weather event created a busy period while you were away
- Your boss offered tickets to everyone as a treat for working hard ""last week""
- You participated in and won a fair draw
- No coworkers seem upset about you winning

The critical point is that your vacation was legitimate and pre-approved. You couldn't have predicted the cold snap, and even if you could have, you had non-refundable travel arrangements. Your boss understood this when approving your time off.

When your boss said ""we were all so busy last week,"" this was likely casual language referring to the office team present, not necessarily excluding you from deserving recognition for your overall hard work. You were described as being ""swamped"" for months before your vacation.

Your coworkers' lack of upset suggests they don't view this as unfair. The draw was offered to everyone and conducted fairly.

While your guilt shows good character and team awareness, you're not at fault for taking approved vacation time or winning a fair lottery. The situation is simply an unfortunate coincidence of timing.

**The Author's Actions:**
- Initially showed interest in getting to know OLG as friends after being told she liked him
- Had consensual relations with someone else the night before the party
- Was unavailable to respond to messages while sleeping during the day
- Sent a polite, non-flirty response when he woke up
- Kept conversations non-sexual and non-flirty throughout
- When pressured by others at the party, briefly considered giving OLG ""a chance""
- Upon meeting her and realizing she had misrepresented herself in photos, politely extracted himself from the conversation
- Avoided further interaction to prevent leading her on

**OLG's Actions:**
- Misrepresented herself significantly in photos (catfishing)
- Made excessive calls and sent multiple messages when the author didn't immediately respond
- Complained to others at the party about being ""led on"" despite no evidence of this
- Created drama at a social gathering

**Others' Actions:**
- Friends appropriately warned the author and helped extract him from an uncomfortable situation
- A mutual friend pressured the author to ""give her a chance"" without knowing the full situation

The author was honest in his communications, never made promises or flirtatious advances, and handled an awkward situation with reasonable politeness. OLG engaged in deceptive behavior (catfishing) and created unnecessary drama. The author's only potential misstep was not immediately clarifying his lack of romantic interest, but given the pressure from others and social dynamics, his approach was understandable.

The friend with terminal brain cancer specifically asked his friends to ""roast him and his cancer as hard as they could without holding back."" He was insistent about this request, even when the author initially didn't want to participate. The author was reluctant but eventually complied with what was explicitly requested.

However, the author's comment crossed a significant line by revealing devastating medical information that the friend apparently wasn't aware of - that he would likely lose cognitive function before dying. This wasn't just a ""roast"" but delivered genuinely harmful news in a cruel way.

While the friend did ask for harsh roasting, there's an implied understanding that such exchanges should be hurtful but not genuinely damaging. The author should have recognized that revealing unknown terminal symptoms goes far beyond typical roasting into territory that could cause real psychological harm.

The friend bears some responsibility for insisting on this activity despite others' reluctance, but his request doesn't justify the author's response that caused genuine emotional damage by revealing frightening medical realities the friend wasn't prepared for.

The author had good intentions in trying to fulfill their friend's request but executed it in a way that caused serious harm by crossing from ""roasting"" into delivering devastating news.

The author is a 21-year-old who enlisted at 18 and has been self-sufficient since then. Their parents, who have financial struggles and relationship issues, are having another baby despite the author consistently expressing concerns about this possibility for years. The author tried to be polite during the announcement but internally feels frustrated and wants to take a ""not my problem"" approach.

The author's reaction seems reasonable given the circumstances:
- They've been consistently honest about their concerns for years
- They're financially independent and living their own life
- They made an effort to be respectful during the announcement despite their feelings
- Their concerns about their parents' financial situation and relationship stability appear to be legitimate
- As an adult living independently, they have no obligation to be involved in their parents' reproductive decisions

The parents appear to have made a decision they've been contemplating for years, knowing their oldest child's position on it. While having children is their right, doing so despite ongoing financial and relationship issues while repeatedly asking for their child's opinion suggests some lack of consideration.

The author isn't being an asshole for having private feelings about a situation that doesn't directly involve them, especially when they've been honest about these concerns for years and still tried to be respectful when it mattered.

The father's behavior is clearly dangerous and abusive - using reckless driving as intimidation is putting everyone's lives at risk and constitutes a serious safety threat. This behavior has been ongoing for years and affects multiple passengers.

However, the author's response of deliberately not wearing a seatbelt as a form of protest is also problematic. While understandable as a reaction to years of this abusive behavior, intentionally increasing the risk of serious injury or death doesn't effectively address the core problem and could result in tragic consequences that wouldn't necessarily change the father's behavior.

The author's frustration is completely valid, and the father bears primary responsibility for creating this dangerous dynamic. But choosing to escalate the danger rather than seeking other solutions (like refusing to ride with him, confronting the behavior directly, or involving other family members) makes this a situation where both parties are contributing to the risk.

The mother appears to be trying to mitigate harm within a bad situation, which seems reasonable given the circumstances.

This represents a complex family dynamic where the primary aggressor (father) has created an environment where others feel compelled to make poor safety choices in response.

The author has two separate issues here:
1. They owe their roommate two months of unpaid rent from their original agreement
2. The roommate's girlfriend has been living there rent-free for about two years

While I understand the author's frustration about essentially subsidizing the girlfriend's living situation, these are fundamentally separate matters. The author entered into a rental agreement and failed to meet their obligations, regardless of what happened later with the girlfriend moving in.

The key problems with the author's reasoning:
- They never addressed the girlfriend's rent contribution when it happened, allowing the situation to continue for two years
- They're now trying to retroactively use this as justification to avoid paying their own legitimate debt
- They're conflating two separate issues rather than addressing them independently

The morally sound approach would be to:
1. Pay the owed rent as agreed upon
2. Have a separate conversation about fair rent distribution going forward

The author does have legitimate grounds to discuss rent redistribution for the future, but using it to justify not paying past-due rent feels like an attempt to avoid responsibility for their original commitment.

The core issue is a fundamental difference in how you and your boyfriend approach material possessions. You're a careful, long-term oriented person who researches purchases and maintains them well, while he's more experimental and replacement-focused.

The key factors here:
- It's YOUR car, so you have the right to set reasonable expectations for how it's treated
- You've communicated your concerns about his driving style
- He's offered to replace anything that breaks, but you don't want replacement - you want preservation
- This reflects deeper compatibility differences in values around possessions

Your request for him to drive more carefully is completely reasonable. When someone borrows your belongings, they should respect your wishes about how those items are treated, regardless of their own approach to possessions. His willingness to replace things doesn't override your preference to maintain and preserve what you own.

However, this seems like a communication and compromise issue rather than anyone being truly ""at fault."" You both have valid but different approaches to possessions. The solution likely involves him respecting your boundaries with your belongings while you both work on understanding each other's perspectives.

Since you're asking for reasonable respect for your property and he should be accommodating that request, but this also stems from fundamental differences rather than malicious intent:

The author's concerns appear legitimate - giving NyQuil to a young child is dangerous and inappropriate, and the mother lied about it when confronted. The author also shows reasonable behavior by trying to protect their sick child from going out and by inviting the mother to family functions despite the strained relationship.

The mother's behavior is problematic throughout: lying about giving dangerous medication to a child, being absent from family events, making ultimatums about the wedding over a sick child, using profanity and name-calling, making false accusations, and most concerning - sending manipulative messages directly to the grandchild trying to turn her against her parents.

While the author did call the mother ""self-centered and selfish,"" this appears to be a measured response to escalating verbal abuse and false accusations. The author also showed restraint by hanging up to avoid saying something regrettable.

The mother's final act of contacting the child directly with manipulative messages crosses a serious boundary and is particularly concerning behavior that could be harmful to the child.

The author describes a pattern of being let down, stolen from, and emotionally hurt by both their aunt and mother over many years. The aunt stole food money meant for the family, made cruel comments about the author's beloved cat, and was responsible for the cat going missing. The mother has struggled with addiction, has been repeatedly incarcerated, has taken the author's money without permission, and has consistently failed to show up for important life events.

While family relationships are important, people have the right to protect themselves from toxic relationships, even with family members. The author appears to have made these decisions after years of disappointment and harm, not impulsively. They've tried to maintain relationships but reached a breaking point after repeated violations of trust and emotional harm.

The author's father seems to have been the stable, supportive parent, and the author has maintained that relationship. This suggests the author isn't simply rejecting all family connections, but rather protecting themselves from specifically harmful relationships.

Setting boundaries with family members who consistently cause harm through addiction, theft, and emotional manipulation is a form of self-preservation, not cruelty.

The author is dealing with a complex social dynamic where they have mixed feelings about Mike but are trying to handle it respectfully. Let me analyze the key behaviors:

**What the author is doing:**
- Privately acknowledging that Mike can be difficult to connect with (which seems to be an honest assessment shared by the group)
- Publicly defending Mike when others criticize him
- Continuing to include Mike and treat him kindly in person
- Making efforts to be welcoming despite personal reservations

**What makes this morally complex:**
- There's some internal conflict between private thoughts and public actions
- The author admits to not genuinely liking Mike while acting friendly

**However, the author's actions are actually quite ethical:**
- They're protecting Mike from gossip and criticism
- They're giving him continued social inclusion despite his social difficulties
- They're making genuine efforts to connect with him
- They recognize Mike may not have many other friends and are being inclusive

The author seems to be handling a difficult social situation with considerable maturity and kindness. Having private reservations about someone while still treating them well publicly and defending them from criticism is actually admirable behavior. Perfect internal/external alignment isn't always realistic, and what matters more is treating people with respect and kindness.

The author acknowledges they have ""no rational argument"" for refusing to sign the name change application and admits they ""can't say that I believe it would hurt her, even if she would regret the decision later on."" This is a significant admission.

Key factors to consider:
- The 9-year-old daughter wants this change
- The other parent supports it
- It's now legally possible due to recent law changes
- Both parents want the change except for the author's resistance
- The author admits having only ""vague feelings"" rather than substantive concerns

While parents certainly have the right to make decisions for their minor children, refusing to act on something beneficial without any rational basis, especially when it affects the child's identity and relationship with both parents, seems problematic.

The author is running a legal cannabis business with parental support, which is fine. However, they sold cannabis to their 17-year-old cousin without parental consent. This crosses several important lines:

1. **Legal issues**: Selling cannabis to a minor is illegal in most jurisdictions, regardless of the business being otherwise legal
2. **Parental authority**: The author deliberately went against the known wishes of the minor's parents
3. **Family boundaries**: Despite being cut off by the uncle and aunt, the author circumvented their authority over their own child
4. **Justification problems**: While the cousin may be stressed, that doesn't justify providing illegal substances to a minor

The uncle and aunt's reaction, while harsh, is understandable given that someone sold drugs to their minor child against their wishes. The parents' anger is also justified - even though they support the cannabis business, selling to minors (especially family minors) crosses ethical and legal boundaries.

The author describes a pattern where their sister regularly insults them, and they respond with minor retaliatory actions. On this particular day, feeling unwell, they unplugged their sister's PlayStation after being insulted about their weight, which interrupted a system update. This led to a family confrontation where the author was blamed while the sister's ongoing insulting behavior was dismissed.

Key factors to consider:
- The sister has been making daily insults for about a year
- The parents consistently side with the younger sibling and dismiss the author's concerns
- The author's retaliation, while petty, was relatively minor compared to the ongoing verbal abuse
- The family is now treating the author as having ""issues"" while ignoring the root cause

While the author's retaliatory behavior isn't ideal, they appear to be responding to a toxic family dynamic where they're being verbally abused daily with no support from parents. The sister's constant insults and the parents' enabling of this behavior while punishing the author's responses suggests the primary fault lies with the other family members.

They even proactively asked building management about alternatives and were told there weren't any.

The guests, however, called the author ""a jerk"" and blamed them for being ""the problem with this country"" over what is fundamentally a building infrastructure and policy issue. This response seems disproportionate and misdirected - the author didn't design the building's waste management system.

While environmental responsibility is important, the guests' harsh judgment fails to acknowledge the practical barriers the author faces or the systemic nature of recycling challenges in many buildings.

Your coworker wasn't wrong to ask, and you weren't wrong to decline while setting boundaries for future requests.

The friend's intentions appear good - she's trying to show care and create a safe space. However, her approach is misguided and patronizing, treating the author like they're fragile or incapable rather than as an equal who happens to be struggling.

The author tried to communicate that they were ""fine"" but this was likely unclear communication - saying you're ""fine"" when dealing with depression doesn't effectively convey that you want normal treatment rather than special handling.

The author shared personal information about Rebecca's political affiliation without her consent in a classroom setting. Even though this information may not have been explicitly secret, Rebecca clearly wasn't comfortable having it shared publicly in that context. The author's intention was innocent - they thought it was a relevant and funny anecdote - but the impact on Rebecca was negative.

However, this appears to be an honest mistake rather than malicious behavior. The author genuinely didn't realize Rebecca would be uncomfortable, feels remorseful about the outcome, and acknowledges they shouldn't volunteer information about others without permission. The fact that Rebecca isn't generally secretive about her views and that political discussions are common in their environment suggests the author reasonably (though incorrectly) assumed this wouldn't be problematic.

Rebecca's feelings are completely valid - being singled out for your political beliefs in a predominantly opposing environment can feel isolating and uncomfortable, regardless of how open you normally are about those beliefs.

This seems like a case where the author made a thoughtless mistake with unintended consequences, learned from it, and feels appropriate remorse. While they bear responsibility for not considering Rebecca's feelings beforehand, it doesn't rise to the level of being ""at fault"" in a moral sense - it's more of a learning experience about respecting others' boundaries.

The author made a reasonable assumption about exclusivity given the circumstances - spending 3-4 nights per week together for 1.5 months, meeting friends, intimate behavior throughout the party. While they hadn't explicitly defined the relationship, this level of involvement typically implies some expectation of exclusivity.

The girlfriend's behavior was problematic regardless of relationship status. Even if they weren't officially exclusive, making out with someone else in front of a person you've been intimately involved with - especially at a party where you brought them as your apparent date - shows poor judgment and lack of consideration.

However, the author's response was also inappropriate. Yelling ""I'M FUCKING DONE WITH YOU, GO BACK TO BOB!"" in front of all her friends at her birthday party was an overreaction that caused unnecessary public humiliation and disrupted the celebration.

The girlfriend's continued harassment afterward, calling him names and having her roommate join in, is also unreasonable behavior that escalates the conflict unnecessarily.

Both parties handled this poorly - she showed poor judgment and consideration, he responded with an inappropriate public outburst, and both continued the conflict afterward when they could have handled it more maturely.

The author is a 17-year-old who has faced years of bullying and antisemitic harassment, affecting her self-esteem and social life. She's asked her parents to use their graduation gift offer for a nose job to help her feel more confident.

Her parents are upset, viewing this as rejecting Jewish heritage and giving in to bullies. They're giving her the cold shoulder and making her feel guilty.

The author is not at fault here. She's:
- A minor dealing with sustained bullying and harassment
- Making a personal choice about her own body
- Not rejecting her Jewish identity (she explicitly states she considers herself Jewish culturally and religiously)
- Seeking a solution to improve her quality of life and mental health

Her parents, while understandably concerned about antisemitism and cultural identity, are:
- Conflating physical appearance with religious/cultural identity
- Giving their daughter the cold shoulder during a vulnerable time
- Not adequately addressing the bullying and harassment she's faced
- Making her feel guilty for wanting to feel better about herself

The real fault lies with the bullies and antisemitic community members who have created this hostile environment, but among the parties directly involved in this family conflict, the parents' response is problematic.

The author has spent years curating a personal playlist from their Discover Weekly, which they're proud of. The wife recently copied a large chunk of these songs to her own playlist in the same order, making it difficult to distinguish between the two playlists.

The author's concern seems to be about maintaining some distinction between their carefully curated collection and their wife's playlist. However, the way they handled this was problematic:

1. **The request itself is reasonable** - wanting some differentiation between playlists is understandable
2. **The delivery was poor** - telling someone to delete songs or demanding they find music ""from any other one of a billion places"" comes across as controlling and dismissive
3. **The underlying issue is minor** - this is about playlist organization, not a serious relationship problem
4. **Better solutions exist** - they could rename playlists, create collaborative playlists, or simply communicate more kindly about preferences

The wife's reaction (being ""pissed"") suggests the author's approach was tactless rather than collaborative. While the author's feelings about their playlist are valid, the way they expressed their concerns created unnecessary conflict over something that could have been easily resolved with better communication.

The author is primarily at fault for poor communication and an unnecessarily demanding approach to a minor issue.

The author is dealing with a partner who has a serious drinking problem that's creating dangerous situations. The boyfriend:
- Got visibly drunk while supposed to be caring for their family
- Nearly drowned in the bathtub due to intoxication
- Has a history of serious injury from drunk bathing (broke his face in 3 places)
- Continues this dangerous behavior despite past consequences
- Shows no concern for how his drinking affects his partner and child

The author's response of pouring beer on him was born out of desperation after he was literally passing out and nearly drowning in the tub. While not ideal, this was an emergency situation where she was trying to prevent him from seriously injuring himself or dying. She had already tried nudging him awake, and he was becoming unresponsive.

The boyfriend is creating an unsafe environment for their 1-year-old child and putting himself in life-threatening situations repeatedly. His drinking behavior is the root cause of this conflict, and he's shown a pattern of dismissing his partner's legitimate safety concerns.

The author initiated the breakup due to their own mental health struggles and life changes. While understandable given their depression and new environment, this was their decision. The ex's response of ""not giving a shit"" seems cold, but people process breakups differently and may use emotional distance as a coping mechanism.

After the breakup, the author immediately regretted it and reached out multiple times over two years despite being told to stop contacting them. The ex clearly communicated their boundary by saying ""stop contacting me,"" yet the author continued sending texts until apparently being blocked.

The author's mental health struggles are valid and deserve compassion, but they don't justify ignoring someone's clearly stated boundaries. The ex has the right to not want contact after a breakup, especially when they've explicitly communicated this wish.

The author is now considering reaching out again after a year of no contact, despite the previous pattern of unwanted contact and apparent blocking. This suggests they may still not be fully respecting the ex's boundaries.

While the ex could have been more compassionate initially, they have the right to protect their own emotional well-being and set boundaries about contact. The author's repeated attempts to contact someone who has asked them to stop is problematic behavior, regardless of their emotional state.

The author has established clear boundaries about their belongings after previous incidents where this classmate took things without permission (like the electric eraser). The author explicitly told the classmate they weren't comfortable lending items due to past damage concerns.

In the chemistry exam incident, the classmate:
- Approached while the author was clearly stressed and studying
- Ignored the author's ""I don't know"" response 
- Physically grabbed and yanked the paper away without asking permission
- Dismissed the author's concerns when confronted
- Showed no respect for the author's property or study time

The author's response was reasonable given:
- They had spent hours creating these notes
- The exam was starting in 2 minutes (extremely time-sensitive)
- This was a pattern of behavior, not an isolated incident
- They were already anxious about the exam
- The classmate could have asked politely or found other resources

The classmate's behavior shows a clear disregard for boundaries, consent, and basic courtesy. Taking someone's study materials right before an exam without permission is particularly problematic. The author was justified in reclaiming their property and refusing to share under these circumstances.

The author is bypassing a line of waiting customers to get service, even if it's quick. While their need is genuinely different (just a date stamp vs. full transactions), there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Fairness principle**: Everyone in line has been waiting their turn, regardless of how long their transaction might take. Cutting ahead violates this basic social contract.

2. **Assumptions about impact**: The author assumes this ""doesn't interfere"" with service, but interrupting clerks who are helping other customers can disrupt their workflow and concentration, potentially slowing down service for everyone.

3. **Setting precedent**: If everyone with ""quick"" requests bypassed the line, it would create chaos and unfairness for those who waited properly.

4. **Alternative solutions exist**: The author could ask a manager about a separate process for pre-paid certified mail, use the self-service kiosk if available, or simply wait in line like everyone else.

While the author's time constraints and the brevity of their request are understandable, convenience doesn't justify cutting in line. The respectful approach would be to wait their turn or find an alternative solution that doesn't disadvantage other customers.

The author engaged in several problematic behaviors:
1. Grabbed the girl's buttocks after she said ""don't do it"" - this is sexual assault, as she clearly withdrew consent
2. Pressured her for nude photos, which is inappropriate and potentially illegal given their age
3. Called their consensual activities ""disgusting"" and said he didn't want to see her ""for a long time,"" which was cruel and hurtful
4. Shows a concerning lack of understanding about consent and appropriate behavior

The girl's response of telling classmates appears to be her way of processing what happened to her and seeking support after experiencing unwanted sexual contact and cruel treatment.

While the initial consensual activities (kissing) were mutual, the author crossed clear boundaries when she said no, then treated her poorly afterward. The classmates' reaction suggests they understand the severity of his actions, particularly the non-consensual touching.

The author's question ""Am I did something wrong?"" and confusion about why people are upset with him shows a troubling lack of awareness about consent and the impact of his actions.

The author broke up with their girlfriend for legitimate relationship reasons (feeling the relationship was one-sided). One month later, the ex came out as nonbinary. Due to timing and summer break, it appeared to others that the breakup happened after the coming out.

The ex then actively spread false rumors claiming the breakup was due to transphobia, which damaged the author's friendships and reputation. This was a deliberate misrepresentation that caused real harm.

However, the author's response - making hurtful comments about their ex not being ""special"" and just being ""a tomboy"" - was also wrong. These comments were transphobic and hurtful, regardless of the provocation.

Both parties acted poorly:
- The ex spread false, damaging rumors about the reason for the breakup
- The author responded with transphobic insults

The core issue is about server ownership rights versus group dynamics. The server owner has technical control and the right to set rules for their server - this is a fundamental aspect of how Discord works. However, the friends feel this particular restriction is overreaching since they view it as a shared space.

Key considerations:
- The owner has legitimate trauma/emotional reasons for the filter
- The word isn't offensive or harmful to others
- The friends have acknowledged the owner's feelings and promised to self-monitor
- The owner still refuses to remove the automated filter despite this compromise
- The server was created as a group communication space

The friends have shown good faith by:
1. Accepting the owner's reasoning once explained
2. Agreeing to be more considerate
3. Offering to self-regulate their language

The owner, while having valid personal reasons, is being inflexible by maintaining automated censorship even after the group has demonstrated understanding and willingness to accommodate his needs voluntarily.

This appears to be a case where both technical rights and reasonable compromise should be balanced. The owner's refusal to trust his friends' good faith effort represents an overreach of his administrative powers in what functions as a shared social space.

The author clearly acknowledges their past abusive behavior - demanding money, emotional manipulation, and falsely accusing their ex to break up with him. This caused significant psychological damage to someone who genuinely cared about them.

In the current situation, the author's response of ""it's better for you to forget me"" was actually appropriate and honest. They recognized they had hurt him and weren't encouraging false hope. However, the deeper issue is that the author's past actions created this entire painful situation. The ex's emotional breakdown, while heartbreaking, is a direct result of the trauma and attachment issues caused by the author's previous abusive behavior.

The author bears responsibility for:
- The original abusive relationship that damaged their ex psychologically
- Creating the conditions that led to his current emotional state
- The long-term psychological impact on someone during formative years (age 12-13)

While the author didn't directly cause him to kneel and cry in that moment, they are responsible for the underlying damage that made such a reaction possible. The ex's intense emotional response and apparent inability to move on suggests lasting psychological harm from the earlier abuse.

The author describes Cruella as consistently insubordinate, refusing to follow orders, withholding important reports that cost the company money (30 cents per dollar of profit), and being disrespectful to multiple people including family members who are her superiors. These are legitimate grounds for termination.

However, the key issue is the author's plan to fire Cruella ""without pay"" - meaning withholding both severance and her final month's wages. While firing her for cause appears justified, withholding earned wages (her final month's pay) is problematic regardless of local labor laws. Earned wages for work already performed should be paid even when terminating for cause.

The author's motivation also seems partially driven by personal revenge (""I truly want to punish her"") rather than purely business considerations, which raises ethical concerns about the approach.

The uncle enabled this situation by protecting Cruella despite her behavior, but that doesn't justify wage theft. Cruella's behavior appears genuinely problematic and termination-worthy, but she's still entitled to compensation for work performed.

This appears to be a case where the firing itself may be justified, but the method (withholding earned wages) crosses an ethical line.

The author discovered their neighbors' dog outside during a severe snowstorm with temperatures below 10°F and windchill. They brought the dog inside, assuming it had escaped, but the neighbors haven't returned for two full days, leaving the dog abandoned in dangerous weather conditions.

The key facts are:
- The dog was left outside in life-threatening weather conditions (below 10°F with snow)
- The owners have been gone for over 48 hours without arranging care
- The author likely saved the dog's life by bringing it inside
- The author is now considering reporting this to authorities

Leaving a dog outside in such extreme weather conditions without proper shelter or care constitutes animal neglect/abuse. Even if the neighbors are generally ""nice people,"" abandoning a pet in dangerous conditions for multiple days is inexcusable and potentially criminal. The author's intervention was necessary and appropriate - the dog could have died from exposure.

Reporting this to animal control or law enforcement is not only reasonable but arguably the responsible thing to do. The dog's welfare must take priority over maintaining neighborly relations when the animal's life is at stake.

The neighbors are clearly at fault for animal neglect, while the author acted compassionately and responsibly throughout.

The author had legitimate concerns about political content in what should be an apolitical municipal space. However, the way they handled their disagreement escalated unnecessarily and became problematic.

The friend expressed interest in hooking up with the girl, but several key factors matter here:
1. He got himself kicked out of the bar, removing himself from the situation
2. There was no prior relationship or established connection between him and the girl
3. The girl made her own choice about who to hook up with
4. Simply declaring intent to hook up with someone doesn't create any binding claim or obligation for others to avoid that person

The friend's anger seems to stem from disappointment and possibly embarrassment, but expressing interest in someone doesn't give you exclusive rights to them, especially when you remove yourself from the situation by getting kicked out. The girl had agency in her decision, and the author didn't actively sabotage his friend or break any established relationship.

While this created social friction in the friend group, the author didn't violate any clear social contract or commitment. The friend's expectations may have been unrealistic.

The author is a 17-year-old who receives money from relatives specifically told to ""treat herself"" with it. She saves this money responsibly for things she wants, like a Kindle. Her father borrows occasionally but is respectful - he apologizes, returns more than he took, and treats it as a real debt. Her mother, however, takes money without asking, takes large amounts (sometimes all savings), and doesn't return it unless repeatedly reminded.

The key issues here are:
1. The money was given to the author by relatives with explicit instructions to treat herself
2. The mother took money the author was saving for a specific purpose (Kindle) 
3. The mother doesn't treat these as real debts requiring timely repayment
4. The mother has money for personal purchases (shoes, dress) and habits (cigarettes, beer) but claims she can't return borrowed money
5. The mother sometimes takes money without even asking

This isn't about family financial emergencies - if it were, the mother would be more apologetic and prioritize repayment like the father does. Instead, she's treating her minor daughter's savings as a convenient source of interest-free loans with no repayment schedule.

The author is being reasonable in expecting borrowed money to be returned, especially when it was given to her specifically by relatives. She's not demanding the money never be borrowed, just that it be treated respectfully and returned promptly.

The mother is taking advantage of her daughter's position as a minor who can't really enforce these debts, while simultaneously having money for non-essential personal purchases.

- Politely asked if the group could play some less competitive games
- When told the group preferred competitive games, they respectfully accepted that decision

2. Doing this in front of the distressed 5-year-old who was begging her to stop
3. Throwing away pictures of the child with her biological mother
4. Acting without discussing it with the father first
5. Continuing to argue that all evidence of the biological mother should be destroyed

The author (father) handled this appropriately by:
- Immediately stopping the destruction when he discovered it
- Preserving the photos for his daughter's future
- Trying to help his girlfriend understand by asking how she'd feel in a similar situation
- Prioritizing his daughter's emotional wellbeing and connection to her biological mother

While the biological mother abandoned her responsibilities, that doesn't justify erasing her from the child's memory or destroying keepsakes that may be important to the child later in life. The girlfriend's jealousy and desire to completely replace the biological mother led her to act in a way that was harmful to the child she claims to care about.

The author is expressing a view that diseases like cancer serve a beneficial population control function and that humanity doesn't deserve cures until we control population growth. They also praise China's one-child policy as an example of good population management.

While the author acknowledges their view might be hurtful to those who've lost loved ones to disease, they're essentially arguing that human suffering and death from illness is necessary and beneficial. This perspective:

1. Treats human lives as expendable for a perceived greater good
2. Shows callous disregard for the immense suffering diseases cause
3. Oversimplifies complex population dynamics (many developed countries actually face declining birth rates)
4. Ignores that the one-child policy led to significant human rights violations and social problems

The author isn't necessarily factually wrong about population concerns being real, but their framing of disease as beneficial and necessary crosses into territory that devalues human life and suffering in a troubling way. Even if discussing controversial topics, there are more thoughtful and compassionate ways to engage with population ethics.

The insensitive framing and apparent lack of empathy for disease victims makes this problematic, even if the underlying concern about sustainability has some merit.

The author is a high school student who feels left out because their parents are spending significant money ($1200/month) on private school for their sister who has apparent dyslexia and is struggling academically, while denying the author the same opportunity despite the family being able to afford it.

Key considerations:
- The sister has a legitimate learning need (apparent dyslexia) and is falling behind academically
- The author is performing well in their current school
- The parents' reasoning is that resources should go where they're most needed
- The author acknowledges their motivation is partly about resume enhancement rather than academic necessity
- The family can afford both but chooses not to

The parents are making a reasonable parenting decision by prioritizing resources for the child who needs additional support. While it may feel unfair to the author, parents routinely make different choices for different children based on their individual needs. The author is already succeeding academically, while their sister requires intervention.

The author's feelings are understandable - it's natural to want equal treatment and opportunities. However, wanting private school primarily for resume purposes when already succeeding academically, while a sibling struggles with a learning difference, shows some lack of perspective about genuine need versus want.

Few days ago, I was at work...",Other,Other,0.85,0.7142857142857143,True,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author is asking basic questions about her boyfriend's whereabouts and who he's with - this is normal communication in a committed relationship where they live together. She's not demanding to control his activities or forbidding him from going out, just seeking basic information about his plans.

The boyfriend's response is concerning in several ways:
1. He gave an ""odd"" evasive response initially
2. He outright refused to say who he was with
3. He claimed she has ""no right"" to know where he is or who he's with
4. This appears to be part of a pattern where ""he never really wanted to tell me"" basic information

In healthy relationships, partners typically share basic information about their whereabouts and social activities voluntarily. While everyone deserves some privacy, completely refusing to share who you're spending time with when living with a partner crosses into secretive behavior that naturally creates suspicion and insecurity.

The author's request for basic information is reasonable and her emotional response (feeling scared and getting ""that disgusting feeling"") is a natural reaction to secretive behavior from a live-in partner.

The boyfriend's extreme position that she has ""no right"" to know anything about his activities while they're in a committed cohabiting relationship suggests he's either hiding something inappropriate or has unhealthy boundaries around transparency in relationships.

The author ate 6 pieces of cheese over 3 days from a package that was sent to both him and his fiancé. He didn't know how many pieces were originally in the bag since it was already opened when he first saw it, and these bags don't have standardized quantities. He also wasn't aware his fiancé had strong feelings about the cheese, especially given her recent focus on healthy eating.

When his fiancé got upset about there being only 2 pieces left, his reaction was to laugh because he found her anger over cheese amusing.

The core issue isn't really about the cheese consumption - that seems like an honest misunderstanding about expectations and communication. The problem is his response to her distress. Even if he found the situation objectively funny, laughing at your partner when they're genuinely upset is dismissive and hurtful. It shows a lack of empathy and consideration for her feelings.

A more appropriate response would have been to apologize for the misunderstanding and perhaps offer to replace the cheese or find another solution. The laughter likely escalated the conflict unnecessarily and made his fiancé feel mocked rather than heard.

While there may have been some miscommunication on both sides about the cheese, the author's reaction to his partner's upset feelings is the main issue here.

The author has a severe case of mono with documented symptoms (sleeping 20 hours/day, jaundice, inflamed spleen) and is still recovering. They made a genuine effort to participate in the date despite their condition, even suggesting alternatives like hanging out until the movie started and making concrete plans for the weekend.

The girlfriend's response seems unreasonable given the circumstances. When the author expressed legitimate safety concerns about driving home late due to their medical condition, she:
- Rejected the compromise of hanging out until movie time
- Suggested an alternative that would still end late and disappoint her daughter
- Gave attitude when the author prioritized safety
- Accused them of being uninterested despite their efforts and future plans

The author was being responsible about their health limitations and driving safety while still trying to maintain the relationship. The girlfriend appears to lack empathy for a serious medical condition and is being unreasonably demanding.

The author's behavior shows consideration for everyone's safety and reasonable accommodation requests for a legitimate medical condition. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and unsympathetic.

The author is considering asking out someone that his friend Bill is attracted to, knowing full well that Bill likes her. While the author mentions that Bill ""isn't the type of guy to ask a random girl out,"" this doesn't give the author free rein to pursue someone his friend has feelings for.

Key considerations:
- Bill has expressed genuine attraction to this person
- They're close friends who spend regular time together
- The author acknowledges Bill's interest but wants to act on his own attraction anyway
- There's no indication the author has discussed this with Bill or gotten his blessing

This violates basic friendship etiquette and loyalty. Good friends typically don't pursue people their friends are interested in without at least having a conversation about it first. The author seems to be using Bill's shyness as justification, but that doesn't make it right.

The woman at Qdoba isn't at fault - she's just doing her job and isn't aware of this dynamic. Bill isn't at fault for being attracted to someone or for being shy about asking people out.

This is a clear case where the author would be prioritizing his own romantic interests over his friendship and basic courtesy.

You've recognized that Steven likely has autism and is a cancer survivor, which provides important context for his behavior. His intense interests in anime, social obliviousness, and learning difficulties in shop class are consistent with autism spectrum characteristics. His iPad use during lessons, while disruptive, may be a coping mechanism or related to his neurological differences.

However, you also mention that Steven ""acts like an asshole"" and that others give him appropriate pushback when he does. This suggests there are legitimate behavioral issues beyond his autism-related traits.

The key issue here is that you admit to giving Steven ""constant"" harassment, even when others weren't participating, and that you ""weren't even realizing it."" This crosses the line from reasonable social feedback into bullying territory. Your recognition that you were targeting someone who is neurodivergent and medically vulnerable shows genuine moral awareness.

While Steven may contribute to conflicts through his behavior, the power dynamic and your admission of relentless targeting makes this primarily about your actions. Your inability to sleep and moral distress indicates you understand the severity of what occurred.

The author was dealing with severe anxiety that was causing physical illness and school absences. They recognized they weren't ready for a relationship and needed to address their mental health first. While breaking up over text is generally not ideal, there are several mitigating factors here:

1. The relationship was very new (only a week)
2. 85% of their communication had been via text due to the author's anxiety-induced absences
3. The author was genuinely struggling with mental health issues
4. They made a mature decision to prioritize getting help
5. The girlfriend responded with understanding and respect
6. They maintained a friendship afterward

The author showed self-awareness by recognizing they needed help and made a responsible choice to end the relationship rather than continue while struggling. The method (text) wasn't ideal, but given the circumstances - their anxiety, the brief duration, and the primarily text-based nature of their interactions - it's understandable.

The girlfriend's positive response suggests she didn't feel wronged by the situation. The author later got help for their anxiety, showing they followed through on their stated reasons.

While breaking up via text is typically discouraged, the specific circumstances here (mental health crisis, very short relationship, established text-based communication pattern) make this more of an unfortunate situation than a fault-worthy one.

The coworker engaged in clear sexual harassment over three years, including:
- Unwanted sexual comments and sounds
- Inappropriate physical contact (pressing against you, touching your breast)
- Showing you explicit images without consent
- Making sexual propositions at work
- Creating a hostile work environment through constant sexual commentary

Your response was completely understandable given the circumstances:
- Fear of confrontation is a normal human response, especially when facing harassment
- Concern about not being believed by executives is unfortunately well-founded in many workplaces
- The power dynamic and isolation (like being alone with him on that terrifying trip) made direct confrontation potentially dangerous
- You did eventually speak up when prompted by your boss

The firing was justified based on his behavior, not on any failure of yours. Sexual harassment doesn't require the victim to say ""no"" clearly or repeatedly - the behavior itself was inappropriate regardless of your response. The company acted appropriately by removing someone whose conduct violated workplace standards and potentially exposed them to legal liability.

You are not responsible for his termination - his own actions over three years led to that consequence. Victims of harassment should not be blamed for how they cope with or report abuse.

The author is concerned about a 2-year-old child who switches homes every single day due to the parents' custody arrangement. The author has already expressed their concern once, and the parents dismissed it, saying the child will ""get used to it.""

Key considerations:
- The author's concern appears to come from genuine care for the child's wellbeing
- They've already raised the issue once and were told the parents have it handled
- The author acknowledges they're not a parent and don't normally deal with kids
- The parents are the ones making the custody decisions and have already considered and rejected the author's input
- Continuing to push the issue after being dismissed would cross boundaries of friendship and parental autonomy

While the author's concern may be valid (daily transitions could indeed be stressful for a toddler), they've already fulfilled their duty as a caring friend by raising the concern once. The parents have made their decision, and repeatedly pushing the issue would be overstepping boundaries, especially since the author admits they lack parenting experience.

The author made a clear mistake by reading private messages that weren't meant for them, even though the classmate forgot to log out. This was a violation of privacy that the author acknowledges.

However, the classmate and her friend were talking negatively about the author behind their back, which is hurtful behavior. While people have a right to private conversations, the content was still unkind.

After the initial incident, both parties apologized, which could have resolved the matter. But the classmate and friend continued posting ""shady stuff"" directed at the author and engaging in ongoing passive-aggressive behavior, escalating the conflict rather than letting it go.

The author's decision to stop engaging and distance themselves from the situation shows maturity and an attempt to de-escalate.

While the author's initial privacy violation was wrong, the classmate and friend's continued harassment and inability to move on after apologies were exchanged makes their behavior more problematic in the long run. The author made one mistake and tried to make amends, while the others engaged in sustained negative behavior.

The author expressed a legitimate preference about communication, and the person they're dating acknowledged it and said they'd try to improve. However, falling asleep while texting is often genuinely unintentional - people don't typically plan to fall asleep mid-conversation. The fact that this happens 80% of the time suggests it's likely not deliberate disregard, but rather a natural sleep pattern or habit that's difficult to change.

The author seems to recognize this might be a ""small quirk"" and is genuinely trying to assess whether their expectations are reasonable. They're not being demanding or ultimatum-giving, just seeking perspective on whether this represents a character flaw or just human nature.

The other person did commit to trying to change but hasn't been successful. However, changing sleep habits and the unpredictable nature of when tiredness hits can be genuinely challenging.

This appears to be a compatibility issue around communication styles rather than anyone being at fault. The author has reasonable preferences, the other person has understandable human limitations, and both seem to be approaching this with good intentions.

The girlfriend made a generous offer to buy her boyfriend a computer after his broke down. When he declined due to feeling undeserving and not wanting her to spend her hard-earned savings on him, she became frustrated and called him ""too difficult,"" leading to ongoing tension.

The author's motivations appear genuinely considerate - he's concerned about her financial sacrifice and feels he hasn't earned such an expensive gift. These are thoughtful, selfless concerns that show respect for her hard work saving money.

The girlfriend's frustration is understandable to some degree, as repeated refusal of a generous gift can feel like rejection of the gesture itself. However, calling him ""too difficult"" and staying upset afterward seems disproportionate when he's clearly trying to be considerate of her finances.

The author handled this respectfully by explaining his reasoning rather than just refusing outright. While he could potentially have found a middle ground (like accepting a smaller gift or proposing to pay her back over time), his core response was thoughtful and well-intentioned.

The author's ex/roommate made several problematic decisions:
1. He told strangers they could stay at the house BEFORE asking the author who lives there
2. When the author expressed discomfort (which is completely reasonable), he ""flipped shit"" and yelled
3. He tried emotional manipulation by threatening to drive drunk

The author's response was entirely reasonable:
- They have legitimate concerns about strangers staying overnight in their home
- They have documented mental health conditions (anxiety, PTSD, etc.) that make trusting strangers particularly difficult
- They expressed their boundaries calmly when asked
- They're dealing with job-related stress that makes drug use risky for them

The author did nothing wrong here. They were put in an unfair position where someone else made decisions about their living space without permission, then was verbally abused for setting reasonable boundaries. The ex/roommate's behavior shows disrespect for the author's home, mental health needs, and personal boundaries.

The author has legitimate concerns about their home being respected. They've made reasonable requests (like asking guests to remove shoes) that are being ignored. The issues described - muddy shoes on clean floors, trash left everywhere, improperly disposed feminine products causing bloodstains in trash cans - go beyond normal guest behavior and show a lack of basic respect for the host's home.

The author has tried addressing this politely multiple times, but the friend continues the same disrespectful behavior. The fact that roommates have also commented suggests this isn't just the author being overly sensitive. These are reasonable boundaries for someone's home.

The friend is clearly at fault for:

- Leaving trash throughout the house
- Improperly disposing of feminine products in a way that creates unsanitary conditions

The author acknowledges he loves his girlfriend but admits he ""genuinely cannot afford the time and effort for her at this moment."" While school demands are understandable, relationships require some level of maintenance to survive. The couple had already compromised down to once-a-week calls, which is quite minimal for a romantic relationship, yet he couldn't even maintain that reduced commitment.

When his girlfriend expressed her legitimate concerns about feeling deprioritized, the author responded by giving her the silent treatment for ""a few days to cool off."" This passive-aggressive response likely made her feel even more abandoned and unimportant.

The girlfriend's frustration appears justified - she was asking for very basic communication in their relationship and wasn't getting it. Her decision to end the relationship, while painful, seems like a reasonable response to feeling consistently neglected.

However, the author isn't malicious here. He seems genuinely overwhelmed with school responsibilities and appears to care about his girlfriend. The core issue is that he took on relationship commitments he couldn't realistically maintain given his circumstances.

The author and friends are taking someone's personal property (lighter, cigarettes) without permission and destroying it, even when the person clearly asks for it back and expresses that it ""really pisses him off."" While their intention may be to help with health concerns, this approach:

1. Violates the smoker's personal autonomy and property rights
2. Continues despite clear communication that it's unwanted
3. Is ineffective (he just buys replacements and won't stop smoking)
4. Causes distress to their friend

The smoker, while engaging in an unhealthy habit, isn't doing anything wrong to others - he's making personal choices about his own body and property.

However, the friends' intentions appear to come from a place of genuine concern for their friend's health, even if their methods are misguided. They're teenagers trying to help in the only way they know how, albeit inappropriately.

The author experienced documented emotional and physical abuse from T during their formative years. When reconnecting with M, the author communicated their discomfort about M's friendship with T and explained the abuse that occurred. This is a reasonable boundary to express.

M's responses are problematic in several ways:
1. She acknowledged T was ""unpleasant"" and was ""horrified"" by the abuse, yet continued the friendship
2. She justified maintaining the friendship by saying she ""feels bad for him""
3. She prioritized T's invitation over seeing the author during a rare visit home
4. She deflected responsibility by blaming the author for not maintaining contact during college
5. She used her feminist academic credentials while simultaneously supporting an abuser

The author handled this appropriately by:

- Not demanding M end the friendship, but stating they couldn't continue their own friendship under these circumstances
- Recognizing M's right to choose her friends while also exercising their own right to step away

While M technically has the right to be friends with anyone, her pattern of dismissing abuse, making excuses for the abuser, and then turning the situation around on the victim shows a concerning lack of support for someone claiming to be a friend.

- Initially told you they paid extra for garage spots (which was false)
- Never offered to share or rotate garage access in 3 years

While it's completely valid to lose interest in someone or want to end contact, the way this was handled was problematic. A honest conversation like ""I've realized we're not compatible and I'd like to step back from our relationship"" would have been more respectful, even if initially more difficult.

The other person doesn't appear to have done anything wrong - having feelings and being emotionally available in what seemed like a mutual connection isn't a fault.

The author acknowledges they lied and chose the easy way out rather than having a mature conversation, which shows awareness that their approach was questionable.

Long story short, I was engaged to this girl like five years ago. In hindsight the engagement was impulsive and basica...",Author,Author,0.8,0.6842105263157895,False,"Looking at this situation step by step:

The author made a significant error in judgment by proposing with a ring from a previous engagement without disclosing this to his current fiancée beforehand. This is problematic because:

1. Engagement rings typically carry deep symbolic meaning - they're supposed to represent a unique commitment between two people
2. Using a ring from a failed relationship without disclosure feels deceptive, even if unintentionally so
3. He put his fiancée in an extremely awkward and hurtful position when the truth came out through a third party

However, the ex-girlfriend's behavior is also questionable. Following the current fiancée on social media and then deliberately reaching out to inform her about the ring seems vindictive and unnecessary. This appears designed to cause drama and hurt.

The current fiancée's reaction, while painful for the author, is understandable given the circumstances. She was blindsided by learning her engagement ring had belonged to another woman.

While the author's financial constraints are understandable, and he claims he would have been upfront if he'd known the ex would contact his fiancée, the core issue remains: he should have disclosed this information from the start or simply sold the ring and started fresh.

The author bears primary responsibility for this situation due to his lack of transparency about something so symbolically important.

The author picked up a hitchhiker who disclosed being recently raped - likely seeking support or simply explaining her emotional state. The author's response was to abandon her at a rest stop based on fear that she might falsely accuse him, despite no threatening behavior from her.

Key considerations:
- The woman showed no aggressive or threatening behavior
- Rape survivors often need support and may discuss their trauma as part of processing it
- The author's fear appears based on harmful stereotypes about rape survivors being likely to make false accusations
- Abandoning someone in a vulnerable state creates safety risks for them
- The author had the option to simply end the ride at an appropriate location rather than abandoning her

While I understand the author felt uncomfortable, his response was disproportionate to any actual threat. The woman was seeking help through hitchhiking and likely trusted him enough to share something traumatic. His actions were based on unfounded assumptions rather than her actual behavior.

The woman did nothing wrong by disclosing her trauma or accepting a ride that was offered.

The author has noble intentions - they're passionate about blood donation due to personal family experiences and genuinely want to help save lives. Blood donation is indeed a valuable community service that can save lives.

However, the author's approach is problematic. They:
- Made harsh judgments about their friends' character, calling them ""negligent and lazy""
- Assumed their friends had no valid reasons beyond ""not feeling like it""
- Failed to consider that people may have private medical, psychological, or personal reasons they don't wish to share
- Used guilt and shame as motivational tools rather than education and encouragement
- Dismissed their friends' feedback about having a ""superiority complex""

The friends' response seems reasonable - they pointed out the author's judgmental attitude. While ""didn't feel like it"" might seem flippant, people aren't obligated to donate blood or justify their personal medical decisions to others.

The author's heart is in the right place, but their execution was counterproductive. Effective advocacy involves respect, understanding, and education rather than judgment and guilt-tripping. The friends weren't at fault for making personal choices about their bodies or for calling out judgmental behavior.

The author is dealing with romantic rejection by immediately cutting all contact and blocking the person. While protecting one's emotional well-being after rejection is understandable, there are several concerning aspects to consider:

1. The author views rejection as being ""shit on"" or ""assfucked,"" which suggests an unhealthy perspective on normal social interactions
2. They seem to view women primarily through a romantic lens, with friendship having no value if romance isn't possible
3. The immediate blocking without explanation can be hurtful to someone who may have valued the connection, even if not romantically
4. The language used (""lost causes,"" ""waste my time"") dehumanizes the other person

However, the friend who confronted them also handled the situation poorly by getting ""in their face"" rather than having a respectful conversation.

The author has the right to manage their own emotional boundaries, but their approach lacks empathy and maturity. They're treating rejection as a personal attack rather than a normal part of human interaction where people simply aren't compatible. The edit shows defensiveness and an unwillingness to consider that their approach might be harmful to others.

While everyone could handle things better, the author's fundamental approach and attitude toward women and rejection is the primary issue here.

The author attended his girlfriend's gymnastics meet and was uncomfortable with what he perceived as sexual elements in her routine. His response was to tell her she ""shouldn't do that sort of stuff"" and compare her performance to stripping ""for dollar bills."" 

Key issues with the author's behavior:
- He's been dating her only a month but feels entitled to dictate her athletic performance
- He dismissed her explanation that this is normal for gymnastics and developed with professional coaches
- He made a degrading comparison to stripping
- He claimed it was his ""job"" as her boyfriend to control her choices
- He showed no respect for her expertise in her own sport

The girlfriend's response was appropriate - she explained the context, defended her routine, and called out his overstepping behavior. Her anger and decision to spend time with supportive teammates instead of someone who just insulted her performance is completely reasonable.

The author admits he feels ""much stronger about her than she does me"" and was ""counting on seeing her tonight,"" suggesting possessive tendencies and prioritizing his wants over her autonomy. His attempt to control her athletic expression after only a month of dating, combined with his dismissive and insulting language, clearly makes him at fault.

The friend with software skills:
- Initially photoshopped your face without permission, causing embarrassment
- You explicitly told him you hated the picture
- He then deliberately sent this embarrassing photo to a group chat that included your crush, knowing full well how you felt about it
- This was a clear violation of your trust and boundaries

Your response:
- You retaliated by mentioning his crush's name and that she was ignoring him
- You immediately deleted it and felt bad about it
- Only people who already knew saw it

The group's reaction:
- Everyone downloaded and spread your embarrassing photo ""everywhere""
- They're now calling you the asshole while ignoring the friend's deliberate betrayal

This appears to be a case where your friend deliberately humiliated you in front of your crush after you explicitly told him not to use that photo. Your retaliation, while not ideal, was brief, immediately regretted, and had minimal impact compared to the ongoing spread of your photo. The group's reaction seems to unfairly focus on your momentary lapse while ignoring the friend's calculated betrayal of trust.

The friend initiated this conflict through a deliberate breach of trust and boundaries, making him primarily at fault.

The author's friend is feeling insecure about his girlfriend posting more attractive/happy photos on Instagram. The author then shared a personal anecdote where similar behavior in their own past relationship was actually motivated by trying to attract other people, and that relationship ended shortly after. The author explicitly told their friend ""maybe it is exactly what is going on (and she want another person in her life).""

While the author acknowledges this might have been an ""asshole"" move, they still chose to plant seeds of doubt and suspicion in their friend's mind during a vulnerable moment. The girlfriend appears to simply be posting happy photos - which could have many innocent explanations (feeling good in the relationship, personal growth, etc.). There's no indication she's done anything wrong.

The author took their own negative experience and projected it onto their friend's completely different situation, potentially damaging their friend's relationship and emotional well-being. Even with good intentions, sharing this particular story in this context was harmful and unnecessary.

The friend's insecurities, while understandable, don't justify being suspicious of normal social media behavior. However, the author's decision to amplify those insecurities rather than provide reassurance or encourage healthy communication makes them primarily at fault for escalating the situation.

The partner's behavior was clearly problematic - he verbally abused a delivery driver who was just doing his job, demanded refunds aggressively, and then turned on the author when they expressed discomfort with his treatment of the delivery person. His behavior was disproportionate to the situation (late food delivery, which he had been warned would likely happen), and he showed no empathy for a service worker just trying to do their job.

The author's response was reasonable - they tried to set expectations about delivery times, felt mortified by their partner's treatment of the delivery driver (which shows appropriate empathy), and only ""snapped"" to defend someone being mistreated. Their emotional response and decision to go to bed rather than escalate the argument further was mature conflict avoidance.

The delivery driver was simply doing their job in difficult circumstances (late evening delivery to outskirts of city) and didn't deserve the verbal abuse.

The restaurant gave a delivery timeframe but the food arrived late - this happens regularly in food service, especially for distant deliveries in the evening, and doesn't warrant the extreme reaction it received.

The partner's behavior was the primary cause of conflict and distress in this situation. His treatment of service workers was inappropriate and his dismissal of the author's valid concerns compounds the problem.

The author paid for a specific amount of cannabis (6 grams) but received less (4.75 grams) because their mother took some without permission. While the mother argues she's entitled to take some because she's shared her own supply before, this doesn't justify taking from something the author specifically purchased.

Key considerations:
- The author paid their own money for a specific quantity
- The mother took from the purchase without asking first
- Previous gifts from mother to author don't create an automatic right to take from the author's purchases
- The mother's higher income is irrelevant to the ownership of what the author bought
- Taking someone else's purchased goods without permission is wrong, regardless of family relationship

The mother violated basic principles of consent and property rights. Even in families, taking someone's purchased items without permission isn't acceptable. The author's response asking for it back was reasonable.

However, I should note that the legality of this situation depends on local laws regarding cannabis.

The author and husband appear to have made genuine efforts to maintain a relationship with the child - sending gifts, money, covering school expenses, and preparing the iPad as a thoughtful present. Resetting a used device before giving it to a child is standard and responsible practice.

The brother-in-law's response was disproportionate and aggressive - yelling over a minor technical issue that could be easily resolved, leaving threatening voicemails, and making unreasonable demands for immediate fixes while they were driving. His pattern of behavior shows consistent unreasonableness: complaining about gift choices, demanding only cash, criticizing their absence from events while not reciprocating visits, and having conflicts with multiple family members (including the other godmother who also cut contact).

The sister-in-law's demand that the husband ""call the boy and tell him in person why he doesn't have a godfather anymore"" is manipulative and inappropriate, essentially asking him to traumatize a child to satisfy their anger.

The author mentions this is part of a long pattern of complaints and unreasonable expectations, despite their continued efforts to maintain the relationship. The fact that other family members (the other godmother) have also cut contact suggests this is a pattern of problematic behavior from the brother-in-law's family.

While it's unfortunate that the child gets caught in the middle, the author and husband appear to have reached a reasonable breaking point after repeated mistreatment and unreasonable demands.

The author is a dedicated student who has consistently demonstrated work ethic through internships, extracurricular activities, and previous full-time work experience before university. They're financially stable through legitimate means (scholarships and student finance) and have secured a placement with a major company, showing their approach is working professionally.

The family members appear to be projecting their own values and possibly some resentment about the author's financial situation. While their work ethic is admirable, they're imposing their perspective without considering that the author's path is different but equally valid. Their criticism seems rooted in the belief that everyone must work part-time regardless of circumstances, rather than recognizing that the author is already building relevant career experience.

The author is making a rational decision based on their specific situation - they don't need the money, have limited time, and are focusing on career-relevant activities. Their argument about CV relevance is sound for their field. They're not being lazy or entitled; they're making strategic choices about how to spend their time.

The family members are being unreasonable by trying to impose guilt and their own values on someone who is clearly responsible and has a different but valid path.

- Live modestly but ensure their daughter never goes without
- Have maintained emergency savings separate from wedding funds
- Are responsibly saving for something meaningful to them

The parents are suggesting the couple should forgo their wedding dreams to spend money on their daughter instead, despite the family being financially secure.

Key considerations:
- The couple is not neglecting their child's needs or financial security
- They're using dedicated wedding savings, not taking from emergency funds or necessities
- Both partners have long envisioned having a traditional wedding
- The daughter is already well-provided for
- Parents can have opinions, but ultimately this is the couple's decision about their own money and life choices

The parents' suggestion, while well-intentioned, seems to imply that parents should never spend money on themselves if it could theoretically be spent on their children instead. This is an unrealistic and potentially unhealthy standard that could lead to parental burnout and resentment.

The author's girlfriend has explicitly communicated that her ""dream would be to shop for her own engagement ring."" This is a clear, direct statement about what she wants for this major life moment. The author acknowledges this but wants to override her expressed preference because he wants the proposal to be a surprise and wants to demonstrate how well he knows her.

While the author's intentions are loving and he's put thought into observing her preferences, he's prioritizing his vision of the ""perfect proposal"" over her clearly stated wishes. The girlfriend has given him valuable information about what would make her happiest, and he's considering ignoring it.

However, this isn't malicious - it comes from a place of love and wanting to create a special moment. The author genuinely believes he can pick the perfect ring based on his observations. But good intentions don't necessarily make ignoring someone's explicit preferences the right choice.

The girlfriend isn't at fault for clearly communicating her preferences. She's been open about what her dream scenario would be.

The author is a stay-at-home partner due to disability who handles virtually all household responsibilities. They've made one simple request - that their boyfriend handle the trash - which is reasonable given the division of labor and the author's stated mental health concerns about accumulated trash.

The boyfriend agreed to this arrangement but has consistently failed to follow through. He said he would do it but didn't act for 4 days despite daily reminders. The author also mentions a pattern of this behavior (referencing a week-long absence where promised chores weren't done).

The author's text message, while expressing frustration, is direct and honest about their feelings. They're communicating the impact of broken promises rather than just complaining about trash. The language about feeling ""lied to"" and ""slapped in the face"" reflects genuine hurt from repeated unfulfilled commitments.

This appears to be a case where one partner is not honoring their agreements in a relationship with a very unequal distribution of household labor. The author's response seems proportionate to the situation - they tried patience and gentle reminders before expressing their frustration more directly.

The author is planning their future wedding guest list and wants to exclude most of their extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins, and even a sibling) while including their friend's family who has been more supportive and caring. Their reasoning includes:

- Extended family members are ""attention seekers"" and ""rude""
- They don't help the author's grandparents during a difficult time
- They haven't made effort to maintain relationships
- Meanwhile, the friend's family actively includes the author and treats them ""like their child""

This is fundamentally about the author's right to choose who celebrates their wedding with them. A wedding is an intimate, personal celebration, and the author has every right to invite people based on the quality of relationships rather than blood relations alone. The extended family's lack of effort in maintaining relationships, their failure to support elderly grandparents in need, and their problematic behavior are all valid reasons for exclusion.

The author shows thoughtfulness by considering their family's potential hurt feelings, but feeling obligated to invite people who haven't invested in the relationship just because of family ties isn't reasonable. The friend's family has earned their place through genuine care and involvement.

The author experienced genuine trauma from witnessing a horrific shooting video, which understandably affected their ability to focus on homework. This is a legitimate psychological response that many people would experience.

However, the author made several problematic choices in how they handled the situation:

1. **Poor communication**: Instead of proactively reaching out to the teacher before the assignment was due to explain the situation and request an extension, they simply didn't do the work and hoped for understanding after the fact.

2. **Inappropriate email response**: The email sent to the teacher was disrespectful, accusatory, and unprofessional. Phrases like ""what you did today was very messed up,"" ""You probably won't understand,"" and ""I really don't know man"" are not appropriate ways to communicate with a teacher, regardless of the circumstances.

3. **Lack of accountability**: While the trauma was real, the author still had options (contacting the teacher beforehand, asking parents for help communicating with the school, etc.) that weren't pursued.

The teacher's actions, while perhaps lacking in empathy, appear to follow standard procedures - giving zeros for missing assignments and communicating with parents about academic and behavioral issues.

1. The brother has a pattern of violent behavior when drunk

The neighbor then confronted the author, accusing them of deliberately giving ""ugly"" bagels - which is an ungrateful and rude response to a free gift.

The author's reaction to kick the neighbor out was understandable given the accusation and ingratitude. However, the decision to stop texting about bagels effectively punishes the innocent children for their mother's behavior. The author acknowledges the kids enjoyed the bagels and weren't complaining, yet chose a response that primarily harms them.

The neighbor is clearly at fault for being ungrateful and accusatory about free food. But the author bears some responsibility for how they handled the aftermath - cutting off communication in a way that punishes the children rather than finding a solution that maintains the kids' access while avoiding the problematic mother.

The children are completely innocent victims caught between two adults' conflict.

This appears to be a case where both the main parties (author and neighbor) contributed to the problem through poor choices, even though the neighbor's initial behavior was worse.

The core issue is that a 13-year-old clearly said ""no"" to having a blackhead removed, but the adults physically restrained her and did it anyway. This is a clear violation of bodily autonomy and consent, regardless of the ""joking"" context or family dynamics.

Key factors:
- The niece explicitly refused consent
- Two adults physically overpowered and restrained a child
- The child is now upset about what happened
- The author recognizes this was wrong and wants to apologize
- The sister dismisses the child's feelings and refuses to allow an apology

While the sister shares responsibility for participating and now blocking resolution, the author initiated the physical restraint after the sister's attempt and is asking for judgment on their own actions. The author clearly violated the child's boundaries despite her explicit refusal.

The fact that this was meant as a joke, was similar to teenage behavior, or involved ""just a blackhead"" doesn't change that it was wrong to physically force something on a child who said no. The author's recognition of this and desire to apologize shows awareness of the harm caused.

The sister's dismissive attitude and blocking of an apology compounds the harm, but the original violation of consent is the primary issue here.

The author describes a friend who:
- Regularly bullies others with cruel comments (""albino monkey,"" targeting someone's poverty)
- Can't handle criticism himself despite dishing it out
- Refuses to take responsibility when confronted
- Only apologizes to those who don't stand up to him, but not to the author who did

The author:
- Tried to address the problematic behavior through conversation
- Stood their ground when the friend became defensive
- Made a decision to end a toxic friendship after the friend showed no willingness to change or apologize

This appears to be a case where someone recognized an unhealthy dynamic and chose to remove themselves from it. The friend's behavior toward others (bullying) and toward the author (refusing accountability, defensive responses) demonstrates a pattern of toxicity. The author's decision to end the friendship after attempting to address the issues seems reasonable and healthy.

The author is expressing anger about preferential parking for expecting mothers and making several problematic arguments:

1. They claim expecting mothers should walk more, ignoring legitimate medical reasons why pregnant women might need closer parking (balance issues, fatigue, physical discomfort, safety concerns)

2. They frame this as ""punishment"" for not having a uterus, when it's actually accommodation for a temporary medical condition

3. They dismiss pregnancy as ""nothing special"" and reduce it to just ""having sex,"" which minimizes the physical challenges and health considerations of pregnancy

The author seems to misunderstand that preferential parking for expecting mothers (like handicap parking) exists for practical health and safety reasons, not as a reward system. Their arguments show a lack of empathy and understanding of why such accommodations exist.

While people can have different opinions about parking policies, the reasoning presented here is based on misconceptions about pregnancy and shows insensitivity to legitimate accessibility needs.

The author describes a 5-year relationship where his girlfriend consistently accused him of looking at other women and talking to other women without evidence. He states he never cheated or treated her poorly, and tried to be respectful. When he saw what appeared to be a photo of her with another man and asked to see it, she refused and ""freaked out."" He then ended the relationship due to the persistent lack of trust.

The girlfriend's behavior shows a pattern of:
- Constant unfounded accusations
- Refusing to trust despite no evidence of wrongdoing
- Extreme reaction when asked about a potentially concerning photo
- Blaming him to friends after the breakup

While relationships require patience and understanding, after 5 years of consistent distrust and accusations without cause, the author's decision to end the relationship appears reasonable. The girlfriend's refusal to show the photo while simultaneously accusing him of impropriety suggests possible projection or hypocrisy.

The author's request for basic trust after 5 years of faithful behavior is not unreasonable. Healthy relationships require mutual trust, and the girlfriend's persistent suspicions without evidence created an unsustainable dynamic.

The author is playing a trivia game with their mom and having a bad day with categories they don't know well. When they fall behind significantly, they ask their mom to let them have answers to questions, including one about their favorite band. When the mom continues playing competitively, the author becomes visibly upset, stops participating properly, throws the controller, and storms off.

While it's understandable to feel frustrated when losing, the author's behavior crosses into inappropriate territory. They:
- Expected their mom to let them win questions just because they were losing
- Became sulky and disengaged when she didn't comply
- Threw a controller and stormed off over a casual game

The mom was playing the game as intended - competitively but fairly. She wasn't being mean or unsporting; she was simply not agreeing to artificially let the author win. Her decision to throw the final question to make the author feel better actually shows she cares, but the author's poor sportsmanship had already damaged the experience.

The friend's behavior seems problematic - asking for a large sum ($3000) with no explanation, setting an urgent deadline (""by end of the day""), and expecting ""no questions asked"" from someone he rarely speaks with anymore. This approach lacks transparency and puts unfair pressure on the author.

However, the author hasn't clearly stated what their response was or if they're feeling guilty about declining. The wife's reaction suggests the author may be questioning whether they handled it appropriately, but asking for reasons before lending a substantial amount of money is completely reasonable.

The friend has every right to ask for help, but the manner of asking - secretive, urgent, and presumptuous - was inappropriate given their distant relationship. The author has every right to want details before lending such a significant amount, especially to someone they rarely communicate with.

The author knew this was someone her former roommate had been involved with for 6 months, even if it wasn't exclusive or serious. While the relationship wasn't committed, the author was aware of the connection and chose to pursue it anyway, knowing it would likely hurt her former roommate.

The former roommate's reaction, while understandable given her feelings, seems disproportionate - treating someone ""like shit"" over a non-exclusive relationship crosses into inappropriate behavior.

The guy was already seeing multiple people, so his actions were consistent with the established dynamic, though not particularly considerate.

However, the core issue stems from the author's decision to knowingly get involved with someone her former roommate cared about, despite understanding the situation. Even in non-exclusive arrangements, there are often unspoken boundaries about respect between friends/acquaintances.

The author showed a disregard for how this would affect someone she had lived with and presumably had some relationship with. The phrase ""I knew exactly who he was but he was cute so I fucked him anyway"" suggests awareness of potential consequences but prioritizing personal desires over consideration for others.

The author was sitting in a priority seat (designated for people who need them most) while completely disconnected from their surroundings - wearing earbuds with loud music and daydreaming. When someone who clearly needed the seat (a lady with a walking stick) got on the bus, the author remained oblivious despite her presence nearby.

While the author's lack of awareness wasn't intentionally malicious, sitting in a priority seat comes with the responsibility to be alert for people who need it more. By choosing to be completely tuned out in such a seat, they failed in this basic courtesy obligation.

The author did apologize and give up the seat once made aware, which shows good character. However, the initial situation - occupying a priority seat while being completely oblivious to someone who needed it - was their responsibility to avoid.

The lady who intervened was perhaps abrupt in her method (smacking and yelling), but she was advocating for someone who needed help and the author wasn't responding to more subtle cues.

The core issue is that when you sit in a priority seat, you accept the responsibility to remain reasonably aware of your surroundings. The author's choice to be completely disconnected while in that seat led directly to the problem.

The author was dealing with a street performer whose singing they found genuinely unpleasant over an extended period. While the performer has every right to sing in public spaces, the author's frustration built up over time from repeated exposure.

The key moment is how the author handled their frustration. Rather than simply moving to a different part of the platform, using headphones, or just tolerating it, they chose to publicly approach the performer and essentially pay her to stop - which was humiliating for her. The author even acknowledges she looked ""predictably hurt and confused.""

However, the author's approach, while blunt and insensitive, wasn't malicious. They offered payment rather than just demanding she stop, and they were honest about their perspective. The performer did accept the money and comply.

The street performer wasn't doing anything wrong by singing in a public space, even if her performance quality was poor. She has the right to perform, and the author's wife and friends' reactions suggest this was handled poorly.

This seems like a case where the author's method was insensitive and publicly embarrassing to the performer, even though their underlying frustration was understandable. The author could have handled this more tactfully or simply avoided the situation entirely.

The author first tried a non-verbal intervention, then attempted a private conversation outside. When the sister-in-law made a ""snide remark"" about them ""taking everything she loved away,"" the author ""erupted"" with harsh truths.

Key considerations:
- The nephew is an adult who has overcome childhood trauma and abuse
- The sister-in-law has a pattern of ""crushing his spirit"" and rejecting him for being gay
- The author took custody years ago due to abuse and neglect
- The sister-in-law initiated the confrontation with her snide remark
- The author didn't yell, spoke factually, and the nephew thanked them afterward
- The in-laws weren't upset with the author's actions

While the author feels guilty seeing her emotional reaction, they were protecting a vulnerable family member from ongoing emotional abuse. The sister-in-law's addiction and recovery struggles don't excuse her continued harmful behavior toward her son. The author tried measured responses first and only escalated when directly provoked.

The author and girlfriend made a mutual decision to celebrate Valentine's Day on February 18th due to legitimate scheduling conflicts - her demanding work schedule at a flower shop during Valentine's season, and his full-time work plus university commitments with major exams. This was a practical compromise that worked for both of them.

The author then made an offhand comment to a mutual friend about the financial benefit of celebrating after Valentine's Day (cheaper prices on gifts and flowers). While this comment was tactless and poorly timed, it appears to have been more of an observation about an unintended benefit rather than the primary motivation for the delayed celebration.

The mutual friend is clearly at fault here for stirring up drama by misrepresenting the author's comment to the girlfriend. The friend twisted a comment about saving money into a malicious narrative that the author was ""purposely prolonging valentine's day so I won't have to spend money on her."" This completely ignored the legitimate reasons for the delayed celebration and created unnecessary conflict in the relationship.

The author made a minor error in judgment by making the money-saving comment, but this was relatively harmless until the friend weaponized it. The girlfriend's reaction, while understandable given how the information was presented to her, seems disproportionate considering she was part of the original decision to delay the celebration.

The primary fault lies with the friend who chose to create drama where none existed.

The author describes a relationship where they:
- Took on all domestic responsibilities, enabling dependency
- Isolated themselves from friends due to their partner's demands
- Completely neglected their own needs to avoid their partner's hurt feelings
- Left immediately when their partner said she was attracted to someone else but wanted to stay together

While the author enabled some of these dynamics by not setting boundaries earlier, they were responding to manipulative behavior.

The author has tried to help by talking to K repeatedly, along with their dance group, but K won't listen and the behavior is escalating.

The author is now considering stepping back from the friendship, hoping that losing a close friend might serve as a wake-up call for K to recognize her mistakes.

This is a genuinely difficult situation. The author has made good faith efforts to help and support K. Continuing to enable or remain close to someone engaged in self-destructive behavior can sometimes inadvertently support that behavior. Sometimes natural consequences (like losing friendships) are necessary for someone to recognize they need to change.

However, abandoning a 14-year-old friend who is clearly struggling and may be in dangerous situations is also problematic. K is very young and may need support more than consequences right now.

The author isn't malicious - they're trying to figure out how to help their friend. But completely cutting off a troubled young person could be harmful, even if well-intentioned.

- Physical restraint and choking (which he admits likely happened even if he doesn't remember clearly)
- Escalating physical violence with the third girlfriend, including bruising and giving her a black eye

The victims' responses (blocking contact, writing about trauma, hiding from him) are entirely appropriate self-protection measures. The author's pattern shows domestic violence and stalking behaviors that caused lasting trauma to multiple people.

The girlfriend's behavior was clearly problematic - being sexually flirty with the author's friends, asking about their intimate details, and then breaking up without addressing her own actions. Her subsequent public attacks and insults were also inappropriate.

The girlfriend's extreme reaction - public insults and harassment - was disproportionate and unacceptable, but the author's choice to publicly frame the breakup in the most unflattering way possible for her helped create the conditions for this escalation.

While families should help each other, there's a difference between occasional assistance and being taken advantage of. The parents' refusal to learn basic skills they use daily, combined with their guilt-tripping response when boundaries were attempted, shows they were being unreasonable. The author tried to address this appropriately by suggesting they learn to do simple tasks themselves.

However, the author did give in to the guilt-tripping rather than maintaining their boundary, which enabled the pattern to continue. A firmer stance or compromise (like scheduled ""tech support hours"" or teaching sessions) might have been more effective.

- Expressed financial constraints regarding housing ($400 max rent)
- Requested care with personal belongings due to limited income

The author is going through a difficult time after a divorce and explicitly wants to spend New Year's Eve alone for their mental health and healing. They want to avoid social interaction, have a quiet evening, and start the new year with healthy activities.

The neighbors, while well-intentioned, are being pushy and not respecting the author's boundaries. They've complained about being ""neglected,"" scolded the author for not visiting immediately upon arrival, and are insisting on the party invitation despite clear reluctance. When the author tried to politely decline, they responded with hurt looks and interrogation about alternative plans.

The author's mother is also being controlling, using fear tactics about NYE dangers and pressuring the author to go to the neighbors' party.

The author's only questionable action was lying about going to a restaurant party, but this appears to be a defensive response to avoid further pressure and interrogation when a simple ""no"" wasn't being accepted.

Everyone has the right to decline social invitations, especially when dealing with personal struggles. The author is being reasonable in wanting solitude during a difficult time. The neighbors and mother, despite good intentions, are not respecting these boundaries and are applying inappropriate pressure.

The author is not being ungrateful or an asshole - they're practicing necessary self-care and boundary-setting during a vulnerable period.
