Your feelings of relief at the prospect of your abusive father's death are not morally blameworthy—feelings, especially those shaped by years of trauma and abuse, are not under your voluntary control and do not make you ""the asshole."" The more ethically complex issue is your inaction when he was choking. While there is a general moral expectation to help someone in a life-threatening situation, this expectation is significantly mitigated when the person in distress is your abuser and your own safety and well-being have been repeatedly threatened by them. Many ethical frameworks recognize that trauma can limit a person's capacity to respond, and that self-preservation is a powerful and understandable motivator.

It is also important to note that, in some places, there may be legal or social expectations to render aid, but these are often balanced against the reality of past abuse and the psychological harm you have endured. Reasonable people might disagree about the morality of your inaction, but given the context of ongoing trauma and the lack of immediate danger to yourself or others, your response is understandable and not blameworthy.

Ultimately, you are not ""the asshole"" for your feelings or your inaction in this context. This is a tragic and deeply dysfunctional situation, and the responsibility for the harm lies with your father for his abuse and with your mother for her denial and inaction. You deserve support and compassion, and it may be helpful to seek counseling or other resources to help you process your experiences and plan for your future.",stop,2,5555,1984,7539

Your situation is emotionally complex, but based on the information provided, neither you nor your partner is acting with clear malice or disregard for agreed-upon boundaries. Both of you are operating within the framework of an open relationship, and while there are understandable feelings of hurt, jealousy, and frustration, these are normal and do not make either party an ""asshole."" The main ethical issue here is a lack of communication and transparency about outside partners and emotional needs, which is a common challenge in open relationships but does not rise to the level of clear wrongdoing without evidence of broken explicit agreements. The healthiest path forward is honest, open conversation about your feelings, needs, and expectations.",stop,1,2342,834,3176

This situation involves ethical failings from multiple parties:

- The woman was dishonest about exclusivity and likely about paternity, depriving both the presumed father and the possible biological father (the author) of the truth, and potentially impacting the child's right to know their biological parent.
- The author, while justified in wanting the truth to come out, handled the disclosure poorly—raising the issue in a public setting and in a way that caused immediate distress, rather than approaching the presumed father privately and sensitively.
- The presumed father is primarily a victim, but the main ethical lapses are on the part of the author and the woman.

Given that both the author and the woman acted unethically, and the harm caused was avoidable with better communication and sensitivity, ""Everybody"" (ESH) is the most accurate classification.

Final Answer: Author

Refined Ethical Evaluation:

In this situation, the core ethical issue is about trust and respect for mutual agreements in a relationship. The author and his partner explicitly agreed not to exchange traditional Valentine's Day gifts. The author, despite agreeing, planned to break this agreement by surprising his partner with flowers, believing it would be a positive gesture.

However, by intentionally disregarding the agreement, the author undermined the trust and mutual respect that such agreements are meant to foster. Even though the intent was positive (to cheer her up), the impact was negative: his partner felt her wishes and the agreement were not respected, especially in the context of a recent disagreement. This can feel manipulative or dismissive, as it suggests that the author's judgment about what would make her happy took precedence over her expressed wishes and their shared understanding.

Ethically, honoring agreements—especially in close relationships—is crucial for maintaining trust. Surprises can be positive, but not when they directly contradict a partner's clearly stated boundaries or mutual decisions. The author’s actions, though well-intentioned, were ethically wrong because they prioritized his own idea of what was best over the agreement and his partner’s autonomy.

Therefore, the ethical responsibility for the misstep lies with the author.",stop,1,1851,825,2676

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
In this situation, the author realized a lack of physical attraction after seeing the other person naked and chose to end the budding relationship. The author gave a softened, less-than-fully-truthful reason (""I've got personal problems and I'm not ready for a relationship"") rather than stating the real reason (""I'm not attracted to your body""). Ethically, this is a common social practice—using a ""white lie"" to spare someone's feelings in a vulnerable context. While absolute honesty is generally valued, in sensitive interpersonal situations, prioritizing kindness and minimizing unnecessary hurt is also ethically defensible. The harm caused by a gentle, indirect explanation is likely less than the harm of blunt honesty in this context. Therefore, while the author was not fully honest, this does not rise to the level of a clear ethical violation. No one in the scenario acted in a way that is clearly ethically wrong.",stop,1,1049,663,1712

Final Answer: Author

This situation is ethically fraught, and while the author’s frustration about parking and zoning violations is understandable, the act of reporting the neighbor—especially as a new, gentrifying resident in a historically marginalized community—carries significant ethical risks and social consequences. Reporting could result in severe harm to the neighbor (loss of livelihood, legal trouble, or worse), and may accelerate displacement or criminalization of long-term residents, reinforcing patterns of inequity and power imbalance.

The author’s willingness to consider reporting, without first deeply engaging with the neighbor, the broader community, or exploring restorative, non-punitive solutions, reflects a prioritization of personal convenience over the well-being and stability of the existing community. This is especially problematic given the context of gentrification and the author’s position as a newcomer with greater access to institutional power.

While the neighbor’s actions may be technically illegal and inconvenient, the ethical responsibility lies with the author to approach the situation with humility, empathy, and a commitment to community-based problem-solving before resorting to punitive measures. Failing to do so—by defaulting to reporting—would make the author the party most ethically at fault in this scenario.",stop,3,5693,2862,8555

Final Answer: Author

The author is ethically at fault in this situation. While he fulfills the legal minimums of child support and visitation, ethical parenting—especially in the face of a child’s serious medical needs—demands more than the bare minimum. The child’s well-being and best interests should be the central concern, and extraordinary circumstances (such as new medical challenges) require flexibility, empathy, and a willingness to seek creative solutions, even when resources are limited.

The author’s repeated refusals to help—financially, logistically, or by participating in important medical decisions—demonstrate a lack of engagement with his ongoing moral responsibilities as a parent. Even if he cannot contribute money, he could have explored other ways to support his child and co-parent, such as adjusting his schedule, seeking community resources, or at least participating in critical medical discussions. By defaulting to “I do what is required” and refusing to engage further, the author fails to meet the ethical obligations of parenthood in a time of crisis.",stop,1,2640,1007,3647

Final Answer: Nobody

Rationale:  
This situation is best understood as a conflict arising from mismatched expectations, communication gaps, and underlying frustrations rather than clear ethical failings by any one party. The author is justified in feeling frustrated and in setting boundaries, especially given his caregiving responsibilities and the disruption to his and his sister’s routine. His offer to pay for a ride service is a reasonable compromise.

However, the girlfriend’s request may stem from genuine concern for her sister’s safety or comfort, not simply entitlement. She may feel more secure having someone she trusts drive them, and her reluctance to use a ride service could be based on personal or family anxieties. The author’s negative feelings toward the sister, while understandable given her described behavior, may be amplifying his frustration and coloring his perception of the situation.

Both parties could have communicated their needs and boundaries more clearly and empathetically. The author could have explained the impact on his sister and himself more calmly, and the girlfriend could have been more understanding of his responsibilities and willingness to help in other ways.

In summary, while the demands placed on the author are inconvenient and arguably inconsiderate, there is no clear ethical violation by either side. The conflict is rooted in poor communication and differing priorities, not malice or gross insensitivity. Both sides could improve their approach, but neither is distinctly ""the asshole"" in this scenario.",stop,3,7187,2775,9962

Ethically, nobody except Judy is strictly obligated to pay for Judy’s trip. While Olivia’s request may be based on your financial situation and the convenience of your relationship with Judy, this does not create a moral obligation for you to pay Judy’s share. The fact that you live in Judy’s apartment and pay her rent may create social pressure or complicate your ability to refuse, but it does not constitute an ethical duty. Friendship norms and reciprocity can sometimes justify helping a friend, but only if you freely choose to do so, not because of external pressure or assumptions about your finances. Olivia’s request is not inherently unethical, but it is not your responsibility to resolve Judy’s debt unless you voluntarily agree. Open communication with both Olivia and Judy is the most ethical way to navigate the situation, but the core ethical obligation to pay for the trip remains with Judy.",stop,2,2294,1279,3573

Final Answer: Author

The author is primarily at fault here. While the intent behind the lie was to play a long-term practical joke rather than to cause harm, deliberately misleading a partner about personal information—however trivial—undermines trust in a relationship. Even if the subject (a middle name) seems minor, the act of repeatedly lying and planning to continue the deception is ethically questionable, especially in a committed relationship where honesty is foundational.

The boyfriend’s reaction may be stronger than the situation warrants, but his feelings of confusion or betrayal are understandable given the context. The author’s actions initiated the breach of trust, so the ethical responsibility lies with them. However, this is a relatively minor infraction and can be resolved with honest communication and an apology.",stop,1,1700,759,2459

Final Answer: Nobody

Your feelings of frustration and exhaustion are entirely understandable given the situation you describe. You have been consistently accommodating your coworker's requests for shift coverage without receiving the same support in return, and this has left you feeling taken advantage of and unable to take needed time off. It's important to recognize that feeling upset in response to an ongoing imbalance is not wrong or selfish.

However, it's also possible that there are factors about your coworker's situation that you may not be aware of, and workplace scheduling can be complicated for both employees and managers. The best course of action is to communicate your concerns directly—both with your coworker (to clarify expectations and boundaries) and with your manager (to ensure fair scheduling and coverage opportunities for everyone). Reviewing workplace policies or norms around shift coverage may also help clarify what is reasonable to expect.

Ultimately, you are not the asshole for feeling this way. Your feelings are a natural response to a challenging and potentially unfair situation. The responsibility for resolving this dynamic lies with open communication and fair workplace practices, not with you for experiencing frustration or exhaustion.",stop,2,3136,1497,4633

Rationale:  
This situation involves conflicting but understandable perspectives and emotional needs. You wanted to briefly visit your mother on Mother's Day—a common and reasonable tradition—especially since your child expressed a desire to come along. Your partner, however, felt strongly that Mother's Day should be focused on her as the mother within your nuclear family, and she took steps to ensure your child stayed home, which may have felt undermining to you.

Neither party acted with clear malice or disregard for the other's feelings, but both could have communicated better and sought a compromise (e.g., a short visit followed by family time). Your partner's reaction was strong, but not wholly unreasonable given her expectations for the day. Your actions were not inconsiderate, but perhaps could have involved more discussion with your partner beforehand.

Your concerns about privacy and security are entirely reasonable and not paranoid. Lending a personal laptop—especially one containing family photos, sensitive documents, and saved passwords—to an employee does carry real risks, both in terms of data security and professional boundaries. Even if the employee is trustworthy, it’s best practice to avoid mixing personal and work resources, or at least to take steps like creating a separate user account and ensuring sensitive data is inaccessible.

Your husband’s offer was well-intentioned and generous, but it overlooked important considerations about privacy, security, and the potential discomfort for the employee, who might feel awkward using a device with someone else’s personal information. While the risk of actual harm may be low if the employee is trustworthy and no sensitive data is accessed, the situation could have been handled more carefully—such as by setting up a guest account or lending a device that had been properly prepared.

Rationale:  
The primary ethical breach in this situation is Joseph's disregard for the user's clearly stated boundaries and lack of consent when he initiated physical intimacy (the kiss). The user communicated that nothing romantic would happen and did not reciprocate Joseph's advances. When the kiss occurred, the user immediately withdrew, expressed distress, and ended contact with Joseph. The user also demonstrated honesty and respect for their relationship with Toni by disclosing the incident right away.

While the user may have engaged in emotionally intimate conversations with Joseph, there is no clear evidence of intent to betray Toni or to pursue a romantic relationship with Joseph. The user took steps to clarify boundaries and acted transparently after the incident. Toni's reaction is not ethically relevant to the classification, as the core issue is Joseph's actions.

Therefore, the ethical responsibility for the problematic behavior in this scenario lies with Joseph, not the user (Author), Toni, or everyone involved.

Refined Ethical Evaluation:

You are not ethically at fault (""the asshole"") for not bringing in a doctor's note when you did not see a doctor, especially if your workplace policy does not clearly require one for a single sick day. It would be unethical to fabricate a note, and you are acting honestly by explaining your situation. However, there are several practical and contextual factors to consider:

- Workplace policies are sometimes unwritten or not clearly communicated. It is wise to double-check your employee handbook or clarify expectations with HR or your supervisor to ensure you are not missing an established norm.
- In healthcare settings, there may be additional legal or regulatory requirements for documenting absences, especially if patient care is involved. You should be aware of any such requirements in your role.
- While you are ethically justified, refusing your boss’s request could have professional consequences. It is best to communicate openly and empathetically, explaining that you did not see a doctor and therefore cannot provide a note, and asking if there are alternative ways to document your absence (such as a self-certification or written statement).
- Your boss is not necessarily at fault for requesting a note, as this is a common practice in many workplaces, even if not always written. They may be following standard procedure or responding to organizational expectations.

In summary, as long as you communicate honestly and seek clarification or compromise, you are acting ethically. Your boss’s request is not inherently unethical either. The situation is best resolved through open, empathetic communication and by seeking clarity on workplace expectations. Therefore, nobody is clearly at fault in this scenario.",stop,2,3103,1588,4691

This situation involves multiple overlapping ethical concerns: the girlfriend’s untreated mental illness and possible dependency, the boyfriend’s well-being and autonomy, the author’s intervention and concerns, and the presence of physical violence and social retaliation.

- The girlfriend’s refusal to seek help and reliance on her partner for all needs, while possibly rooted in severe mental illness, does not excuse physical violence or manipulation. Her actions toward her boyfriend (hitting, kicking) are abusive and ethically unacceptable, regardless of her mental health status.
- The boyfriend is in a vulnerable position, potentially being subjected to abuse and manipulation, but he also has agency and responsibility to seek help or set boundaries.
- The author’s concerns are valid, especially regarding the boyfriend’s safety and well-being, and their attempt to help (offering to call for an appointment, expressing concern) was reasonable. However, the author should be careful not to conflate their own experience with mental illness with the girlfriend’s, as each case is unique.
- The girlfriend’s attempt to damage the author’s reputation among friends is ethically questionable and may be retaliatory.
- The situation is complex and cannot be attributed to a single party’s ethical failing. The primary ethical breach is the girlfriend’s abusive behavior, but there are also issues of dependency, boundary-setting, and social conflict.

Your actions were based on a reasonable interpretation of your mother's instructions, and there was no intent to disrespect your grandfather or your family's mourning process. While your family’s reaction reflects their own expectations and emotional state during a difficult time, ethical responsibility for intentional disrespect does not rest with you in this situation. 

It is important to recognize that cultural and familial norms around mourning can shape expectations, and misunderstandings can still cause hurt even if unintentional. Feeling regret or sadness about the misunderstanding is a natural, empathetic response, but you are not morally at fault. Moving forward, open communication and expressing understanding for your family's feelings can help repair any hurt and show respect for their grieving process.

Final Answer: Everybody

Your situation is ethically complex and involves shared responsibility among all parties. The sustained, coordinated pressure from your friend group—especially your best friend—to disclose and conform your feelings was inappropriate and a clear violation of your emotional boundaries and privacy. This kind of group pressure can be manipulative and is ethically wrong, as it disregards your autonomy and comfort.

However, it’s also important to acknowledge your own agency. While the pressure was significant and understandably difficult to resist, you ultimately chose to say you had a crush, knowing it wasn’t fully true. This decision, though made under duress, had real emotional consequences for your best friend. In close relationships, honest and timely communication is crucial, especially when feelings are involved. While your later honesty in clarifying your true feelings was the right thing to do, clearer communication about your discomfort and uncertainty earlier on might have helped prevent some of the hurt.

Your best friend’s reaction—calling you “mentally weak” and dismissing your explanation—was hurtful and inappropriate, though it likely stemmed from her own disappointment and emotional pain. While her feelings are understandable, her words crossed a line and did not respect your experience or vulnerability.

The broader social dynamics—peer pressure, groupthink, and the expectation to conform—played a significant role in distorting everyone’s actions and feelings. These dynamics are ethically problematic for all involved, not just for the person being pressured.

Ultimately, everyone involved bears some ethical responsibility: your friends for pressuring you, your best friend for her reaction, and you for not asserting your boundaries more firmly and for misrepresenting your feelings, even if only temporarily. It’s important to recognize that prioritizing your own well-being and boundaries is not only permissible but necessary in healthy relationships.

In summary, the ethical responsibility here is shared. Everyone involved contributed, in different ways, to the confusion and hurt that resulted.",stop,3,8395,2608,11003

Both parties contributed to the conflict in ways that were unhelpful and escalated the situation. The girlfriend reorganized the room without asking, which was inconsiderate, and her apologies were qualified and defensive rather than fully sincere. She also resorted to name-calling and dismissiveness, which is disrespectful. On the other hand, the author repeatedly demanded a specific form of apology even after she had apologized (albeit imperfectly), which was inflexible and prolonged the argument over a relatively minor issue. Both could have communicated more constructively and de-escalated the situation. Therefore, ""Everybody"" is the most accurate classification.",stop,1,1640,773,2413

Final Answer: Author

Your discomfort with your friend's behavior is valid, especially when it makes you feel embarrassed or ignored. You absolutely have the right to set boundaries and ask her to stop making comments that make you uncomfortable or disrupt your conversations. However, telling her that she ""makes the LGBT community look bad"" crosses a line from addressing her specific behavior to making a sweeping judgment about her identity and how she expresses herself. This kind of statement can be hurtful, reinforce gatekeeping within the community, and unfairly place the burden of ""representing"" an entire group on one person.

A more constructive approach would be to talk to your friend about the specific behaviors that bother you—like making loud sexual comments or ignoring you in conversation—without tying it to her identity or the broader LGBT community. Focus on how her actions affect you personally, rather than making it about how she reflects on others.

So, you would be the one in the wrong (WIBTA) if you told her she ""makes the LGBT community look bad,"" but you would not be wrong to ask her to be more considerate of your feelings and the social context.",stop,1,2091,858,2949

This situation reflects a mutual communication breakdown rather than a clear ethical lapse by one party. The husband made an offer to make dinner but became absorbed in his hobby and failed to follow through or update the author about the change in his intentions. The author, meanwhile, did not communicate her growing hunger or clarify her expectations as the evening progressed, instead choosing to make alternative arrangements without discussing her needs. Both parties operated from different assumptions—her reluctance to ""demand"" a favor versus his expectation of being reminded or prompted—which is a common source of conflict in relationships. The escalation into argument and frustration was fueled by these unspoken expectations and a lack of clear, direct communication from both sides. Therefore, ethical responsibility is shared: both could have contributed more actively to resolving the situation through open dialogue.",stop,3,5965,2503,8468

Your ethical responsibility in this situation was significant. By remaining silent while your girlfriend made a false and extremely serious accusation—one that resulted in real harm to an apparently innocent person—you became complicit in that harm. The other driver suffered not only financial and legal consequences but also reputational damage from being falsely accused of racism. While it is understandable that you felt shocked and paralyzed in the moment, your inaction allowed an injustice to occur and persist.

Your girlfriend’s lack of remorse and willingness to lie for personal gain is deeply troubling, but your own moral conflict and sleeplessness show that you recognize the gravity of the situation. Ultimately, while the primary wrongdoing was your girlfriend’s, your silence contributed to the harm. Ethically, you had a duty to speak up, even if it was difficult.

Therefore, in the context of the ""Am I the asshole?"" framework, you are at fault for not intervening, though your guilt is less than your girlfriend’s. The most accurate classification is Author.",stop,1,2578,771,3349

Your situation is emotionally difficult, but it does not involve clear ethical wrongdoing by any party. Friend groups often change as interests shift, and while your friends could have been more considerate about including you or being sensitive to your feelings, there is no evidence of intentional cruelty or malice. You are not wrong for feeling hurt or for wanting to leave a group where you no longer feel valued. Your friends' actions may have been inconsiderate, but not to the degree that would make them ethically blameworthy in a strong sense.

Final Answer: Everybody

Rationale:  
This situation involves ethical lapses and responsibilities on both sides, making ""Everybody"" the most appropriate classification.

The author’s frustration is understandable: they endured months of discomfort, attempted subtle hints, and faced a persistent, severe hygiene issue that negatively affected the shared workspace. The colleague, meanwhile, has a responsibility to maintain basic hygiene in a communal environment, as their neglect creates a hostile and potentially unhealthy situation for others.

However, the author’s choice to confront the colleague publicly, in front of others, caused embarrassment and distress. While the author may have felt all other avenues were exhausted, ethical communication still calls for as much discretion and empathy as possible, even in difficult circumstances. Ideally, the author would have sought private dialogue or institutional support (e.g., HR), but the lack of mention of such resources suggests possible systemic shortcomings as well.

Both parties contributed to the breakdown in workplace civility: the colleague by neglecting their hygiene responsibilities, and the author by resorting to a public confrontation. The situation also hints at possible institutional failure to provide effective mechanisms for resolving such issues.

Given these shared responsibilities and missteps, ""Everybody"" best captures the ethical complexity of the scenario. The confidence is moderate (0.7) due to the nuanced and context-dependent nature of workplace ethics in such cases.",stop,3,3491,1898,5389

Final Answer: Other

Rationale:  
The ethical failing in this situation lies squarely with the mother, who has repeatedly manipulated and financially exploited her children, including a minor. This behavior is not only unethical but potentially abusive, especially given the pattern of targeting vulnerable family members for personal financial gain. The author and their siblings are victims of this manipulation, not perpetrators.

The author is understandably conflicted about whether to disclose the situation to their father, given the complex family dynamics and emotional history. While there is a strong ethical imperative to act to protect the younger siblings—especially the 17-year-old brother and the 8-year-old twins—the author’s hesitation is rooted in concern for the family’s well-being and the potential fallout of disclosure. This is a difficult and emotionally charged decision, but the responsibility for the harm lies with the mother, not the author.

The author would not be ""the asshole"" for telling their father, and in fact, may have a moral obligation to intervene or seek outside help to prevent further harm. However, the question is about blame for the current situation, and the author’s actions (or inaction so far) do not rise to the level of ethical wrongdoing given the context and their own victimization.

Therefore, the correct classification is ""Other""—the mother is the one at fault, not the author or the siblings.",stop,3,6038,2766,8804

Final Answer: Nobody

Your situation is a nuanced clash of values between you, your boyfriend, and your family. Ethically, you are not ""the asshole"" for feeling exhausted by the ongoing conflict or for considering ending the relationship if the stress outweighs your happiness. Your boyfriend is not at fault for sharing your modern views on partnership, and your family, while holding traditional beliefs, appears motivated by concern for your well-being rather than malice.

However, it’s important to consider a few deeper points:

- If your family’s concerns are solely about who pays or who drives, and you are genuinely comfortable with your relationship dynamic, then their pressure is rooted in generational expectations, not objective mistreatment. You have the right to set boundaries and communicate that your values differ.
- If there are other, unspoken reasons for their discomfort—such as noticing behaviors you may have overlooked—it’s worth having an open conversation to clarify their concerns. Sometimes, loved ones see things we miss, but sometimes their worries are simply outdated.
- Breaking up with someone primarily due to external pressure can lead to regret or resentment. It’s ethically important to make relationship decisions based on your own values and well-being, not just to appease others.
- Persistent family pressure, even if well-intentioned, can become emotionally manipulative over time. You are justified in setting boundaries to protect your autonomy.

In summary, nobody here is acting with clear ethical wrongdoing. The conflict is rooted in differing perspectives, not malice or neglect. The best path forward involves honest communication, boundary-setting, and self-reflection to ensure your choices align with your own values and happiness.",stop,2,4674,1941,6615

Your feelings and concerns are completely valid, especially given your history of being valued primarily for your looks and the anxiety that comes with it. Wanting to protect yourself from being objectified or used is a natural response, and it’s understandable that you’d be wary after receiving a troubling message from your boyfriend’s friend.

However, the specific approach you’re considering—secretly “testing” your boyfriend by withholding intimacy and not wearing makeup to see how he reacts—crosses into ethically questionable territory. While it’s not malicious, it is a form of covert manipulation: you’re setting up a scenario to judge his motives without his knowledge, rather than addressing your concerns openly. This can undermine trust and communication in your relationship, and it may not give you clear answers, since his reactions could be influenced by many factors unrelated to your test.

That said, your desire to protect yourself is not inherently wrong. If you need to take a step back from intimacy or appearance-related efforts for your own comfort and self-care, that’s absolutely your right. The key ethical distinction is whether you’re doing this for your own well-being (which is healthy and appropriate), or as a secret test to judge your partner (which is less fair to him).

A more ethical and effective approach would be to reflect on your needs and boundaries, and consider having an honest conversation with your boyfriend about your insecurities and the message you received. If you’re not ready for that, it’s okay to take things slowly and prioritize your own comfort, but try to avoid setting up secret tests.

In summary: While your feelings are valid and your desire for self-protection is understandable, the specific plan to secretly test your boyfriend’s motives would make you the one in the wrong (“the asshole”) in this situation. Open communication or honest self-care are better paths forward.",stop,2,4887,2068,6955

Your feelings of exclusion are completely understandable, especially after three years together and having previously been invited. It’s natural to want to be included in your partner’s important traditions, and it can feel hurtful to be left out, particularly when your relationship has grown more serious. At the same time, your boyfriend is being invited to a longstanding group event with limited space—a situation largely outside his control.

Asking your boyfriend not to go unless you’re also invited does risk putting him in a difficult position, but it’s not inherently wrong to express your feelings or hopes for inclusion. What matters most is how you both communicate and navigate this together. Ideally, your boyfriend would acknowledge your feelings, advocate for your inclusion if possible, and you would both discuss what this means for your relationship and future plans.

This is a profoundly difficult and emotionally charged situation with no clear ethical wrongdoing by either party. The author’s concerns about passing on a serious heritable disease are valid and compassionate, and the desire for a biological connection to one’s children is a common and understandable feeling. The partner’s distress is also entirely legitimate, as she is facing not only the loss of a shared dream but also the pain of feeling defined by her genetics.

However, it is important to recognize that the way these concerns are communicated and handled matters greatly. If the author was insensitive or dismissive in expressing their decision, that could be ethically problematic. But based on the information provided, there is no evidence of malice or disregard—only a difficult, honest conversation about deeply personal values and fears.

It is also worth noting that the author’s reluctance to consider adoption, combined with their unwillingness to risk biological children, does limit the partner’s options. Ideally, both partners would explore all available alternatives—such as genetic counseling, IVF with preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or donor gametes—before making a final decision. Open, empathetic communication and professional counseling could help both partners navigate this complex issue.

Ultimately, neither party is acting out of selfishness or cruelty. Both are grappling with a painful conflict between love, hope, and fear. This is not a situation where blame is appropriate; it is one that calls for mutual understanding, compassion, and support.",stop,3,5812,2910,8722

The author is not at fault in this situation. Wanting to wait before marriage—especially after only four months of dating and before living together—is not only reasonable but also reflects maturity and a desire to build a stable foundation. The girlfriend’s repeated insistence on immediate marriage, despite the author’s clear and thoughtful boundaries, raises concerns about impulsivity, respect for autonomy, and emotional maturity. Her withdrawal and refusal to communicate after not getting her way is a problematic response that undermines healthy conflict resolution and could be seen as a form of emotional manipulation.

Your concern for your children’s well-being is understandable and valid—many parents in co-parenting situations worry about how resources are being used and want to ensure their children’s needs are prioritized. It’s also natural to want to discuss these concerns with a partner, especially when they are a significant part of your life.

However, the way you are expressing these concerns—frequently venting about your ex’s appearance, spending, and parenting decisions—can place an emotional burden on your girlfriend. While some discussion of co-parenting challenges is to be expected in a relationship with a parent, it’s important to recognize that your girlfriend has a right to set boundaries about how much and what kind of conversation about your ex she is comfortable with. Her ultimatum may feel abrupt, but it likely reflects her feeling overwhelmed or sidelined by the ongoing negativity.

A healthy relationship requires open communication and mutual respect for boundaries. Rather than viewing your girlfriend’s response as a sign she’s “not ready to date a parent,” it may be more constructive to see it as an opportunity to negotiate how you both want to handle these difficult topics. You might consider seeking additional support—such as from friends, family, or a therapist—so that your relationship isn’t dominated by conflict with your ex.

In summary, while your underlying concerns are reasonable, the frequency and focus of your complaints are unfair to your girlfriend and risk harming your relationship.

Your feelings of frustration and protectiveness toward your dog are entirely valid, especially given his history and your desire to help him feel safe. Navigating a situation where another person—particularly someone with a disability and in a family setting—is overwhelming your dog is genuinely difficult. It’s understandable that you hesitated to intervene, given the social dynamics, your status as a guest, and the presence of other responsible adults.

Ethically, the responsibility for ensuring safe and respectful interactions with your dog is shared among all adults present, especially the cousin’s caregivers. While it’s ideal to advocate for your dog’s needs, your hesitation in this complex, sensitive context does not make you an “asshole.” No harm occurred in this instance, and your concern for both your dog and the cousin is clear.

Going forward, it’s reasonable to work with your boyfriend and his family to set gentle, clear boundaries to protect your dog and support positive interactions for everyone. But in this situation, your struggle is understandable and not blameworthy. No one acted with malice or disregard; rather, everyone was doing their best within a challenging scenario.

Final Answer: Other

Analysis:

In this situation, the primary ethical breach lies with M (the ""Other""). OP (the Author) was open and honest about her feelings for the guy from the start, repeatedly communicated her boundaries, and expressed hurt when those boundaries were crossed. M initially denied any interest in the guy, continued to interact with him despite knowing it hurt OP, and only later admitted to developing feelings. This pattern demonstrates a lack of transparency and disregard for OP’s feelings, which is a significant violation of friendship trust.

While OP’s emotional response and decision to end the friendship may be difficult, it is a reasonable act of self-protection after repeated hurt and boundary violations. Setting boundaries in response to ongoing emotional pain is not inherently unethical or unfair.

Therefore, the ethical responsibility for the breakdown of the friendship rests primarily with M, not OP. OP is not the ""asshole"" for ending the friendship; M’s actions are the main ethical issue.",stop,3,6565,2976,9541

The lead tech's response, on the other hand, was a direct and hostile personal insult (""fat ass"") that escalated the situation and crossed a clear line of professionalism, especially given his position of authority on the team. While both comments were inappropriate, the lead tech's reaction was disproportionate and more damaging to the work environment. As such, the greater responsibility for the breakdown in civility and the negative shift in workplace atmosphere lies with the lead tech.

Your situation is complex and emotionally charged, but based on the information provided, you are not the ""asshole"" here. You acted in good faith, communicated openly, and tried to meet your father's expectations while also advocating for your own autonomy and well-being. Your emotional response (crying) is a natural reaction to stress and criticism, not a manipulative tactic. The accusation of ""gaslighting"" from your father is inappropriate and misapplies the term, which refers to intentional psychological manipulation to make someone doubt their reality—something not supported by your actions.

Your father's approach, shaped by his military background and possibly by trauma, emphasizes obedience over understanding or intrinsic motivation. While he may believe he is helping, his methods (including past corporal punishment and current emotional pressure) are ethically questionable, especially given the power imbalance between parent and child. Your suggestion to learn from natural consequences is developmentally sound and shows maturity.

Ultimately, the conflict arises from a clash of values and communication styles, not from malice or wrongdoing on your part. If you continue to feel distressed or unsupported, consider reaching out to a trusted adult, counselor, or mental health professional for guidance.

In summary: you are not the ""asshole,"" but the situation reflects deeper issues in communication and parenting style. The ethical responsibility for the conflict does not rest with you alone.",stop,1,3934,1093,5027

Final Answer: Nobody

Refined Response:

Your decision to buy a sound module at a low price and consider reselling it for profit (“flipping”) is not inherently unethical. In many contexts, reselling is a common and accepted practice, especially when it does not involve deception, scalping essential goods, or exploiting vulnerable individuals. However, it’s important to recognize that some communities—such as niche hobbyist groups—may have their own norms and values that view flipping negatively, often out of concern for community access and affordability. While these norms are not universal ethical standards, they can shape how your actions are perceived within those groups.

The strong reaction you received from the Discord group likely reflects their community values and concerns, rather than an objective moral judgment. Their words were harsh and understandably hurtful, but this does not mean you are a bad person or that your intentions were nefarious. It’s natural to feel upset when others judge you harshly, especially when you are already in a difficult situation.

No one in this situation is ethically blameworthy. You acted out of a reasonable desire to support yourself, and the group reacted based on their own values—though their delivery could have been kinder. This is a case of differing perspectives and social norms, not clear-cut right or wrong.

If you find yourself feeling isolated or self-critical, please remember that your worth is not defined by a single action or by others’ opinions. It can help to reflect on the values of different communities before sharing your intentions, and to seek out spaces where you feel understood and supported. If your distress continues, consider reaching out to someone you trust or a mental health professional for support. You deserve compassion and understanding, both from others and from yourself.",stop,2,3650,1937,5587

This is a situation where neither party is ethically at fault. It is not wrong or unethical to lose attraction to a partner after they undergo significant changes, such as a gender transition. Attraction is not something that can be controlled, and it is important to be honest with oneself and with one's partner about these feelings. At the same time, your partner has the right to express their gender identity and pursue medical transition in the way that feels right for them.

It is understandable to feel guilt or sadness about the end of a relationship, especially when both people are simply being true to themselves. However, expressing your feelings honestly and respectfully is the most ethical course of action. There is no ""bad person"" here—just two people whose needs and identities have changed in ways that are no longer compatible. Compassion and kindness are important, but so is honesty.",stop,1,1557,752,2309

Final Answer: Everybody

Ethical Analysis:  
This situation involves ethical missteps on both sides. The mother’s insistence on seeing her adult son’s full bank balance is an overreach that violates reasonable expectations of privacy and autonomy, even if she has financial concerns or cultural reasons for her request. At the same time, the son’s plan to deliberately deceive her by hiding his money is ethically problematic. Deception, even as a defensive response, undermines trust and can damage the relationship if discovered.

The most ethical approach would be for the son to communicate openly, set clear boundaries, and negotiate a fair contribution to household expenses. The mother, for her part, should respect her adult son’s financial privacy and autonomy, and any requests for support should be transparent and reasonable.

Both parties have ethical responsibilities: the mother to respect privacy and the son to be honest and assertive. The context (such as financial hardship or cultural norms) may influence expectations, but does not justify overreach or dishonesty. Therefore, ethical responsibility in this situation is shared.",stop,3,4604,2461,7065

You were not wrong to seek clarification about a rumor that could seriously affect your relationship, especially since multiple people mentioned it and you were feeling uneasy. Open communication is important, and you did not accuse your girlfriend outright—you asked for her perspective.

However, neither of you acted with malice or intent to harm; you were both navigating a difficult and emotional situation as best you could.

Your concerns about communication and wanting to be informed about your girlfriend's plans are reasonable, especially given your background and efforts to be trusting and non-controlling.

At the same time, your girlfriend is entitled to her independence and may not realize the impact her lack of communication and certain texts have on you. The core issue here is a mismatch in communication styles and boundaries, not malice or clear wrongdoing from either side.

Your frustration is understandable: after years of loyalty, seeing another member receive special treatment without a clear explanation can feel unfair. However, simply feeling upset does not make you the ""a******""—emotions are natural, especially when fairness seems lacking.

That said, it’s important to distinguish between your feelings and your actions. If your response was limited to expressing your concerns to the manager and feeling uncomfortable about possible gossip, your reaction is proportionate and reasonable. However, if your actions became disruptive—such as repeatedly confronting staff or other members, or making accusatory assumptions based on ambiguous social cues—then your behavior could be seen as inappropriate. From your description, there’s no clear evidence of such behavior.

On the manager’s side, she may have legitimate safety concerns that justify her discretion, even if the policy isn’t fully transparent. In some cases, managers are not able to share all the reasons for their decisions, especially when it comes to personal safety or liability. While more transparent communication would be ideal, her actions are not necessarily unethical.

Finally, inferring that the manager was talking about you based solely on another member’s reluctance to share details is not strong evidence and could lead to unnecessary conflict.

In summary: your feelings are valid, and unless your actions crossed into disruptive territory (which is not evident from your account), you are not the ""a******."" The manager’s actions, while perhaps lacking in transparency, are not clearly unethical given the context. Therefore, nobody is at fault in this situation.",stop,2,3361,1740,5101

Your feelings of disappointment and hurt are completely understandable, especially given the care and effort you put into celebrating your family members’ birthdays. Wanting to feel appreciated and acknowledged on your birthday is a natural and reasonable desire. However, before assigning ethical blame, it’s important to consider a few key factors:

- **Unintentionality and Family Culture:** Not all families place the same emphasis on birthdays, and your family may not realize how important this day is to you. Their neglect may be unintentional or rooted in family habits, rather than a deliberate disregard for your feelings.

- **Communication:** If you haven’t clearly expressed how much birthdays mean to you or how hurt you feel when yours is overlooked, your family and fiancé may simply be unaware. Ethically, it’s important to communicate your needs and feelings directly before holding others accountable for not meeting unspoken expectations.

- **Reciprocity and Motivation:** It’s natural to hope that the care you show others will be reciprocated, but if you haven’t shared your expectations, others may not realize the significance of your actions or the impact of their inaction.

- **Constructive Self-Advocacy:** Rather than publicly confronting or shaming your family, a more ethical and effective approach would be to have a private, honest conversation about how you feel and what you would appreciate on your birthday.

Given these considerations, you are not being an “asshole” or childish for feeling hurt, nor is your family necessarily at fault if they are unaware of your feelings. The ethical responsibility here is shared: it’s important for you to communicate your needs, and for your family to listen and respond with care once they understand.

Final Answer: Other

Refined Response:

In this situation, the primary ethical lapse lies with your husband (""Other""). While the initial mistake with the order appears to be the restaurant's fault (as evidenced by the correct receipt), the more significant issue is how your husband responded to the mistake and your disappointment.

Given the context—ordering takeout is a rare treat due to financial constraints, and you were looking forward to a specific meal—your disappointment is understandable and emotionally valid. The fact that your husband has made similar mistakes before adds to your frustration and suggests a pattern that may feel dismissive of your preferences.

The key ethical principle at play here is reciprocity and care within a partnership. You state that you would have gone back to correct the order for him if the roles were reversed, which sets a reasonable expectation for mutual support. Your husband’s refusal to go back, citing tiredness, may be understandable to a degree, but it falls short of the standard of care and effort that you expect and are willing to provide. This lack of reciprocity is the core issue.

While escalation to shouting is not ideal and both parties could have communicated more constructively, your strong reaction is rooted in a pattern of feeling undervalued and unsupported. The greater ethical responsibility lies with your husband for not making the extra effort to correct the mistake and for not acknowledging the emotional significance of the situation to you.

Therefore, while both parties could have de-escalated, the more significant ethical lapse is on your husband’s side.",stop,3,5546,2479,8025

This is a highly stressful and emotionally complex situation involving mental health crises, family obligations, and personal boundaries. You are making significant sacrifices to support your wife and her mother, even at the cost of your own comfort and sense of home. Your feelings of discomfort, frustration, and even resentment are understandable and valid, given the upheaval in your life.

While the racist language used by your mother-in-law was deeply inappropriate and hurtful, it occurred while she was heavily medicated and in a vulnerable state, which complicates the ethical assessment. It is important to acknowledge the harm such language can cause, but in this context, her intent and capacity were likely impaired.

Your actions toward your brother-in-law—setting boundaries to protect your household—are reasonable, especially given the history of financial strain. As long as you are not acting out of malice, but rather out of a need to maintain stability, your response is ethically defensible.

Most importantly, you are not acting out of selfishness or cruelty. You are trying to balance compassion for your wife and her mother with your own well-being. Open communication with your wife about your feelings is important for your relationship and your own mental health, but your current actions do not make you an ""asshole.""

Your feelings of hurt and disappointment are entirely valid. You were led to believe there was mutual romantic interest, and your friend’s sudden withdrawal—without explanation—was inconsiderate and emotionally negligent. While he was not obligated to pursue a relationship, he did have an ethical responsibility, as a long-time friend, to communicate honestly and respectfully, especially after initiating clear romantic intentions. Ghosting you and then attempting to set you up with someone else, without addressing your feelings or the situation, further demonstrated a lack of care for your emotional well-being.

You are not at fault for choosing to end the friendship or for not wanting to provide an explanation. Setting boundaries to protect yourself is reasonable and justified. While some might argue that a brief, honest explanation could offer compassionate closure, you are not ethically required to do so, especially given the pain caused by his actions.

Final Answer: Nobody

Ethical evaluation:

You would not be the asshole (WIBTA) simply for respectfully and thoughtfully asking your girlfriend if she would consider trimming or shaving her pubic hair, especially since you are motivated by your own comfort and are attentive to your own grooming. However, it is crucial to recognize that the acceptability of such a request depends heavily on how you approach the conversation and the broader social context.

Key considerations:

- Bodily autonomy and consent: Your girlfriend has the right to decide how she grooms her body. You can express your preferences, but you must be prepared to fully accept her decision, even if she chooses not to change her habits. Any pressure, resentment, or repeated requests after a clear answer would cross a line.
- Sensitivity and emotional impact: Requests about body hair can be deeply personal and may touch on insecurities or past experiences. Even a well-intentioned question can be hurtful or make someone feel self-conscious. Approach the topic gently, frame it as a personal preference, and make it clear that your attraction and respect for her are not contingent on her response.
- Gendered expectations and social context: Women often face disproportionate societal pressure to remove body hair. Even if you also groom, your request may unintentionally reinforce these pressures. Acknowledge this context and be especially careful not to make her feel obligated to conform to external standards.
- Mutuality and reciprocity: While it’s reasonable to discuss preferences in a relationship, grooming is not transactional. Your choice to groom does not obligate her to do the same, and the conversation should not be framed as a quid pro quo.
- Alternatives: Consider whether there are other ways to address your discomfort, such as using a barrier (e.g., dental dam) or adjusting sexual activities, rather than focusing solely on changing her grooming habits.
- Communication: The manner of your request is critical. A respectful, open, and non-pressuring conversation is key. Make it clear that you value her comfort and autonomy above your preference.

In summary, as long as you approach the conversation with care, respect, and a genuine willingness to accept her choice, you would not be the asshole for asking. However, the potential for harm means you must be especially thoughtful and sensitive. If you were to pressure, shame, or repeatedly bring up the issue after she declines, that would be unethical.

Therefore, in this situation, nobody would be the asshole—provided the conversation is handled with utmost respect and acceptance of her autonomy.",stop,3,4768,2756,7524

Your frustration is entirely understandable given your heavy caregiving responsibilities and the apparent lack of support from your siblings, who have more resources and fewer immediate obligations. Ethically, your siblings do bear significant responsibility for not proactively offering help or even checking in, especially given your clear need for support. However, the way you chose to communicate your frustration—through a harsh, confrontational email—was not the most constructive or fair approach. This method likely escalated conflict and may have made it harder for your siblings to respond positively, even if your underlying concerns were justified.

Family caregiving is ethically complex, and responsibility is often shared. Your siblings should have been more attentive and involved, but you also had an ethical responsibility to communicate your needs in a way that fostered understanding and cooperation. Both the lack of support and the confrontational communication contributed to the breakdown.

In summary: your siblings failed to step up, but your method of expressing your frustration was also problematic. The ethical lapse is shared—everybody involved could have acted better to support both your mother and each other.",stop,3,4874,2318,7192

Final Answer: Nobody

Your concerns about the safety and well-being of your own children, as well as the legal and reputational risks to your family, are ethically significant and justify your reluctance to invite your wife's friend and her child into your home. You are not refusing to help; you are offering substantial support by proposing to pay for alternative housing, which demonstrates compassion while prioritizing your family's safety. This is a responsible and ethically defensible position, especially given the potential for harm and the presence of your own children.

Your wife’s desire to help and model compassion is also ethically admirable. However, her argument that this would teach your children a ""real life lesson"" does not override the real and significant risks involved, particularly when those risks could directly affect your children’s safety and well-being.

Both you and your wife are acting from legitimate ethical values—protection and charity. Neither position is blameworthy, and both reflect reasonable moral priorities. The vulnerability of the friend’s child is a serious concern, but your offer to provide alternative support addresses this without exposing your own family to undue risk.

Final Answer: Author

Rationale:  
While the author’s concerns about their financial situation and the practicality of career changes are understandable, the approach taken—suggesting that his wife “should consider looking for a new job” despite her chronic illness and anxiety—demonstrates a lack of sufficient empathy and understanding for her lived experience. Chronic pain and anxiety can severely limit a person’s ability to seek or adapt to new employment, and dismissing her self-assessment risks minimizing her struggles. The author’s framing places the burden of change primarily on his wife, who is already in a more vulnerable position due to her health and employment circumstances.

A more ethical and supportive approach would involve collaborative problem-solving, validating the wife’s limitations, and exploring a range of solutions together (such as accommodations, financial counseling, or alternative sources of support), rather than focusing on what she “should” do. The author’s well-intentioned but insensitive suggestion, without adequate consideration of his wife’s challenges, makes him more at fault in this situation.",stop,3,6361,2447,8808

Pretending your pet is a service dog in order to circumvent train policies is unethical and, in many places, illegal. Service animals are protected under the law to ensure that people with disabilities can access public spaces and services without discrimination. Falsely claiming your dog is a service animal undermines the credibility of real service animals and can make life more difficult for people who genuinely need them. It also erodes public trust and may lead to stricter regulations that harm those with legitimate needs. While your desire to hike with your dog is understandable, this approach is dishonest and potentially harmful to others. You would be the asshole if you went through with this plan.

Your frustration is understandable—accommodating strict dietary restrictions, especially when they aren’t medically confirmed, can be challenging and emotionally taxing for family members.

Dismissing her experience and making a snide joke, especially after she expressed discomfort, was insensitive and invalidating.

Final Answer: Author

Your behavior in this situation is ethically problematic for several reasons:

- Consent and Boundaries: Your girlfriend has clearly expressed that she does not want to share her food, and you admit to pushing her until she relents. Pressuring someone after they say no disregards their autonomy and comfort, which is not respectful or fair in a relationship.
- Fairness and Reciprocity: Because your girlfriend is vegetarian and you order meat, she cannot reciprocate by trying your food. This creates an imbalance—she is being asked to give up part of her meal without the opportunity for equal exchange.
- Dismissing Her Feelings: You refer to her concerns as “bs” and justify your actions by saying “guys need more food.” This is dismissive of her feelings and not a valid ethical justification for taking her food.
- Communication and Solutions: Rather than respecting her wishes or finding a compromise (such as ordering a shared appetizer or extra side), you persist in behavior that upsets her.

In summary, the ethical issue is not about whether couples “normally” share food, but about respecting your partner’s boundaries and feelings. In this scenario, you are in the wrong for repeatedly pressuring her and dismissing her concerns.",stop,1,1652,875,2527

This is a situation marked by significant trauma, confusion, and the challenges of adolescence. Both you and your ex are very young and have been through a great deal together, including difficult and painful experiences that would be overwhelming for anyone, let alone teenagers. Your feelings of hurt, jealousy, and confusion are understandable given the intensity of your relationship, the trauma you’ve endured (including a miscarriage, family rejection, and abuse), and the lack of support you’ve received.

It’s not fair to label you as “the asshole” for having complicated emotions or for struggling to communicate clearly in the aftermath of so much pain. Likewise, your ex is also young, likely confused, and trying to cope in his own way. While his actions may feel insensitive, they are not necessarily malicious—he is also navigating heartbreak and uncertainty.

Neither of you is acting out of cruelty or with the intention to hurt the other. Instead, you are both doing your best to cope with overwhelming circumstances without the tools or support you need. What’s most important now is compassion—for yourself and for each other—and seeking help from trusted adults or professionals who can support you through this difficult time.

Final Answer: Other

Rationale:

In this scenario, the primary ethical responsibility does not rest solely with the Author, nor is it equally shared by ""everybody."" Instead, the most significant ethical lapses and duties fall on ""Other"" parties—specifically, the family and, to a lesser extent, the healthcare providers.

- The Author, as a legal adult, has the right to make decisions about their own medical care, provided they possess decision-making capacity. There is no clear evidence in the scenario that the Author lacks capacity; they articulate their reasoning, reflect on their past, and have discussed their choices with their psychologist. Unless there is a formal finding of incapacity, the Author’s autonomy should be respected, even if others disagree with their decision.

- The Family, however, has acted unethically by publicly posting about the Author’s private health information on social media and engaging in gossip. This is a clear violation of the Author’s privacy and dignity, and it perpetuates mental health stigma. The family’s role should be to provide support and respect, not to shame or expose the Author.

- Healthcare Providers have an ongoing duty to assess the Author’s capacity, provide clear information about risks and benefits, and support the Author’s autonomy while ensuring safety. If there are concerns about capacity or risk, they should address these through appropriate clinical channels, not through family gossip or public exposure.

- The Author’s responsibility is to make informed choices and consider the risks, but unless capacity is impaired, they are not acting unethically by discontinuing medication.

Therefore, the most ethically significant failings and responsibilities in this scenario lie with ""Other"" parties—primarily the family (for privacy violations and stigmatizing behavior) and, to a lesser extent, healthcare providers (for ensuring ongoing support and capacity assessment).

The boyfriend’s reaction and approach to joint finances are more ethically problematic in this situation. The author’s purchase of heels was a reasonable, work-mandated, one-time expense, especially given her larger financial contribution to the joint account. In contrast, the boyfriend’s recurring, high-cost weed purchases—framed as “work expenses”—are far less justifiable, and his insistence that the author repay the account for a necessary work item is inconsistent and unfair. His response (storming out, dismissing her explanation, and demanding repayment) reflects a lack of empathy and double standards, especially given his own spending habits.

Final Answer: Other

Rationale:  
The primary ethical responsibility in this situation lies with the friend and her boyfriend (""Other""), as they are the decision-makers regarding the adoption and care of the animals. They have a direct duty to ensure the well-being of both their current elderly dog and any new dog they bring into their home, considering their work schedules, the needs of both animals, and the potential for harm or neglect.

The author (user) has a secondary, limited moral obligation: to voice concerns if they believe harm may come to the animals. However, the user is not the primary agent responsible for the outcome, as they do not control the decision or the environment. The animals themselves are moral patients (their interests matter), but they do not bear ethical responsibility.

Final Answer: Author

Ethical Analysis:  
It is reasonable and fair to ask for an increase in child support if the ex's financial situation has improved, but only insofar as it benefits the shared child. Child support is intended to provide for the needs and welfare of the child both parents share, not to subsidize the living expenses of the author's entire family or her other children, for whom the ex has no responsibility. The author explicitly states the motivation for requesting more support is to ""have more money to support my whole family,"" which goes beyond the ethical and intended scope of child support.

While the author's circumstances are difficult and deserving of empathy, it would be ethically wrong to expect the ex to take on financial responsibility for children who are not his, or to use his increased income to support the author's broader family needs. The appropriate and ethical course would be to request a child support adjustment based solely on the needs of their shared child and the ex's new income, not to supplement the household as a whole.

Therefore, the author would be in the wrong (WIBTA) if she asks for more child support specifically to support her whole family, rather than just the shared child.",stop,1,2108,792,2900

The author, as the adult in this situation, bears primary ethical responsibility for the conflict and its escalation. Making sexual or BDSM jokes to a minor is inappropriate regardless of server culture or the minor's perceived maturity. When the minor expressed discomfort, the author should have immediately reflected on the appropriateness of their behavior and ceased all such jokes. Furthermore, the author's subsequent hostile and disparaging remarks toward the minor were disproportionate and constitute bullying.

Both parties in this situation share some ethical responsibility. The panhandler’s use of an elaborate story, while perhaps understandable given social stigma or learned behavior, can be seen as manipulative or disrespectful of your time. On the other hand, your response—cutting him off abruptly and expressing visible frustration—while understandable from a boundary-setting perspective, lacked empathy and civility. Both honesty and respect are important in public interactions, and both parties fell short: the panhandler by not being direct, and you by responding harshly.

Final Answer: Nobody

Your concern for your sister’s safety is not only understandable but ethically justified, given the significant age gap, her lack of relationship experience, and the well-documented risks of exploitation and grooming in such dynamics. Your suspicions about the older man’s intentions are reasonable, not merely “uncharitable,” and your desire to meet him before your sister becomes more involved is a protective, caring impulse.

While issuing an ultimatum (“I won’t allow you to keep seeing him unless I meet him”) does risk undermining your sister’s autonomy, it’s important to recognize the context: you have already tried softer approaches, and your sister’s secrecy and refusal to introduce her partner are themselves red flags. In situations where a loved one may be at risk of harm and less direct interventions have failed, escalating your response—even if it means setting a hard boundary or involving other trusted adults—can be ethically warranted.

At the same time, your sister is legally an adult, and ultimately, you cannot control her choices. The ethical fault here does not lie with you for being protective, nor with your sister for being inexperienced and possibly infatuated. The primary ethical concern is with the much older man pursuing a relationship with a vulnerable young woman.

In summary:  
- You are not at fault for your protective actions, given the risks and your limited options.  
- Your sister is not at fault for her naivete or choices at her age.  
- The ethical problem lies with the older man’s behavior, not with you or your sister.

However, the Pro Controller is being used with a shared family device, and the parents’ expectation of some degree of sharing is reasonable within a household context, especially among minors.

The brother’s expectation to use the controller without reciprocation or responsibility is problematic, particularly given his history of carelessness. However, his frustration at being excluded from a shared family activity is also understandable, especially if he feels left out or perceives unfairness.

The parents, while seeking fairness, may be too dismissive of the author’s legitimate concerns about property and responsibility, and could do more to mediate a compromise that respects both parties’ interests (e.g., conditional sharing, clear rules, consequences for misuse).

In sum, all parties could act more ethically: the author by considering reasonable, conditional sharing; the brother by respecting property and demonstrating responsibility; and the parents by facilitating a fair compromise rather than unilaterally siding with one child. The situation calls for communication and compromise, not rigid stances.

Therefore, the most accurate classification is: Everybody.",stop,3,9102,3015,12117

Final Answer: Nobody

You are not the asshole for wanting to protect your games, especially given your brother’s track record of not taking care of his own or your property. It’s reasonable to set boundaries to prevent your belongings from being damaged. At the same time, your brother may not fully understand the value you place on your games or the importance of taking care of shared items, and he may feel left out if excluded. This is a common sibling conflict and doesn’t make either of you inherently wrong or malicious.

A balanced approach would be to have an open conversation with your brother about your concerns, perhaps with your parents involved to help set clear household expectations about borrowing and caring for games. You could consider alternatives, such as letting him play under supervision, establishing clear rules for borrowing, or teaching him how to handle discs properly. This way, you protect your property while also giving your brother a chance to learn and participate.

Ultimately, this is a situation where communication, empathy, and clear boundaries are key. Neither you nor your brother is an asshole—this is a normal family dynamic that can be resolved with understanding and cooperation.",stop,3,4209,2176,6385

Your intention to pursue a romantic relationship with your friend’s past abuser, while actively concealing it from the survivor to avoid causing her harm, places you in a position of ethical wrongdoing. Even if you believe the abuser has changed, the ongoing trauma and trust your friend has in you should take precedence. The secrecy required to maintain this relationship is itself harmful, both to the survivor and to the integrity of your social circle. It also places undue emotional burden on others (such as the survivor’s boyfriend) and undermines the survivor’s autonomy and right to make informed decisions about her relationships. The lack of any restorative justice or reconciliation process further compounds the harm.

Your actions in this situation were ethically unjustifiable. Even if the initial contact was intentional, your response—throwing someone to the ground and stomping on their face multiple times—was grossly disproportionate and went far beyond reasonable self-defense. The uncertainty about whether the initial act was even intentional further undermines any justification for your violent retaliation. Intoxication does not excuse this level of harm, and the negative reactions from your friends reflect a reasonable moral judgment, not just a particular worldview.

Final Answer: Everybody

Explanation:  
This situation reflects a breakdown in communication and shared responsibility between both partners. While the author’s rigid refusal to participate in housework is problematic and suggests a lack of flexibility and empathy, it is also important to recognize that the wife appears not to be contributing significantly to housework, despite being at home and having periods with reduced childcare duties. Without more information about her circumstances (such as health, other responsibilities, or unspoken challenges), it is difficult to assign sole responsibility.

Both partners seem to be operating under assumptions about what the other ""should"" do, rather than engaging in open, empathetic dialogue to renegotiate roles as their family’s needs change. The lack of communication and mutual support is at the heart of the issue, and both parties share responsibility for not addressing the imbalance collaboratively.

Therefore, the most ethical and balanced classification is that both parties are contributing to the problem by not working together to find a fair and sustainable solution.",stop,3,4217,2342,6559

Final Answer: Author

Your desire to improve yourself for your family is admirable, and seeking meaningful experiences or personal growth is not inherently selfish. However, in this situation, the way you are approaching the Peru trip—especially given your wife’s strong negative reaction and the significant burden it would place on her—leans toward inconsiderate.

Taking a week-long international trip, leaving your wife to solo-parent three very young children, is a major ask. If your wife is not genuinely supportive and feels overwhelmed or upset, proceeding with the trip would be prioritizing your needs over hers and the family’s immediate well-being. In a partnership, especially with young children, major decisions that shift significant burdens require enthusiastic consent and collaborative planning. Without that, it risks creating resentment and undermining trust.

Additionally, while a transformative trip can be helpful, it’s important to consider less disruptive ways to address your feelings of being stuck or depressed—such as therapy, local activities, or incremental self-improvement—before opting for something that so heavily impacts your family. If you do pursue the trip, it should only be with your wife’s full support, a clear plan for her to get equivalent time for herself, and robust support systems in place.

In summary: If you go ahead with the trip against your wife’s wishes or without her genuine support, you would be the one acting inconsiderately in this scenario. The best path forward is open communication, exploring alternatives, and ensuring your wife’s needs are equally prioritized.",stop,3,8980,2968,11948

Final Answer: Other

You are not the asshole for sharing the screenshots with your boyfriend. Ethically, you acted with integrity and concern for the well-being of others by bringing to light behavior that is harmful and disrespectful to women in your community. Transparency in relationships and communities is important, especially when it comes to addressing patterns of inappropriate or harmful conduct.

Your boyfriend’s reaction—resenting you for ""ruining"" his friendship and wishing you had kept him in the dark—is understandable on an emotional level, as learning disturbing truths about close friends can be deeply upsetting and disorienting. People often experience denial, anger, or defensiveness in response to such revelations. However, while his emotional turmoil is valid, directing his resentment at you rather than at his friend’s behavior is misplaced. It is not your fault that his friend acted inappropriately, nor is it wrong to expect honesty and accountability in your relationship.

It’s also important to recognize that your boyfriend may need time to process this information and come to terms with the reality of his friend’s actions. His current reaction may be a temporary response to shock and grief, rather than a fixed ethical stance. Open communication, empathy, and support are crucial as you both navigate this difficult situation.

Ultimately, the responsibility for the fallout lies with your boyfriend’s best friend, whose actions prompted this situation. Your boyfriend’s response is problematic, but it is rooted in emotional distress rather than malice. You acted ethically, and the blame does not rest with you.

Therefore, the most accurate classification is ""Other""—your boyfriend is in the wrong for his response, but it is important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding of the emotional complexity involved.",stop,3,5141,2464,7605

Ethical Analysis:

The teacher (Author) made a significant error in judgment by allowing underage students to wear bikini tops and cut-off shorts at a school-sponsored fundraiser. While the intention may have been to support the students' comfort and foster a fun environment, the decision failed to account for several important ethical and professional responsibilities:

- Duty of Care: As a teacher and coach, the author is responsible for protecting students from potential harm, including objectification, exploitation, and reputational risk. Allowing attire that could attract inappropriate attention—especially from adults and students from other schools—demonstrates a lapse in this duty.
- Professional Standards: School events should maintain a standard of appropriateness, especially when minors are involved. Even if the students were enthusiastic and nothing overtly bad happened, the situation created an environment that was not in line with expected professional conduct.
- Community and Parental Expectations: The backlash from parents and the community indicates that the decision was out of step with local norms and expectations. Parental consent and communication should have been sought for any deviation from standard dress codes.
- Inexperience as a Mitigating Factor: The author’s inexperience and good intentions are mitigating factors, but they do not absolve the responsibility to exercise sound judgment and seek guidance when unsure.

While the students and principal also played roles, the primary responsibility for the decision—and its consequences—rests with the author as the adult in charge. Therefore, the most accurate classification is Author.",stop,1,1985,812,2797

In this situation, no one rises to the level of being an ""asshole"" in the ethical sense, though there are areas where all parties could have handled things better. The author (OP) dressed according to the party theme and weather, did not intend to make his girlfriend uncomfortable, and responded appropriately by apologizing and offering to change when he realized there was an issue. The girlfriend’s feelings of discomfort and jealousy are understandable and valid, though her way of expressing them (insults, storming out) was not ideal. The friends’ teasing and touching were inappropriate, but the OP did not encourage or welcome this behavior.

Overall, this is a case of miscommunication and mismatched expectations rather than clear ethical wrongdoing.

Your discomfort at the girl's comment is understandable, especially given the group's respect for the deceased and the sensitive context. It's also valid to feel that her humor was out of place in that moment. However, grief manifests in many ways, and some people—especially those who were close to the person—may use dark or flippant humor as a coping mechanism, even if it makes others uncomfortable. Your response (""Wow, kind of harsh, but okay"") was mild and not intended to shame, but it did publicly call out her behavior, which could have made her feel isolated or judged in her own grief.

At the same time, her comment was jarring for the group and could be seen as disrespectful, even if unintentionally. Neither of you acted with malice; both responses were shaped by your own emotional states and coping styles. In situations of communal grief, discomfort and misunderstandings are common, and there is no perfect way to navigate them.

Given the complexity and the fact that both parties were likely acting from a place of pain, nobody here is truly at fault. This is a difficult, emotionally charged situation where empathy for all involved is warranted.",stop,3,4941,2420,7361

Ethical Analysis:

Applying ethical frameworks such as fairness, reciprocity, and respect for autonomy, the core issue is whether it is ethically appropriate for your partner to expect to live with you without contributing financially or through other means (e.g., chores), and to use emotional pressure when you set reasonable boundaries.

- Fairness and Reciprocity: In a shared living arrangement, it is ethically reasonable to expect both parties to contribute in some way—financially or through other agreed-upon responsibilities. Refusing to contribute in any form, while expecting the benefits of cohabitation, violates principles of fairness and shared responsibility.

- Autonomy and Boundaries: You have the right to set boundaries about what you are comfortable with in your living situation. It is not ethically required for you to subsidize your partner’s living expenses if you are not comfortable with it.

- Emotional Manipulation and Respect: Your partner’s response—becoming angry, making accusations about your love, and refusing to discuss alternative contributions—constitutes emotional manipulation. This is ethically problematic, as it undermines respectful communication and mutual decision-making.

- Power Dynamics: The situation also raises concerns about power imbalances, as your partner’s financial dependency and emotional tactics could pressure you into an arrangement that is not in your best interest.

Conclusion:

Given these considerations, the ethical responsibility for the problematic aspects of this situation lies primarily with your partner (the ""Other""). He is not fulfilling reasonable expectations of shared responsibility and is using emotional manipulation to pressure you. You are acting within your rights to set boundaries and expect fair contributions.

Therefore, the correct classification is: Other.",stop,1,2378,783,3161

Final Answer: Other

Losing a close family member is an incredibly difficult experience, and it’s natural to want and expect comfort from your partner during such a time. In most relationships, it’s a reasonable expectation that your significant other would proactively offer support—especially in the immediate aftermath of a sudden loss. While you could have explicitly asked for company, it’s understandable that you were overwhelmed by grief and may not have had the energy or clarity to do so.

Your boyfriend’s actions—helping to sell your ticket and sending a last-minute offer to come over before the rave—show some awareness, but ultimately, he chose to prioritize his own plans over being physically present for you when you were most vulnerable. The timing and manner of his offer (just before leaving for the rave) understandably felt insincere, and it’s reasonable for you to feel hurt or let down by that. In moments of acute grief, many would expect their partner to take initiative and be there, even without being asked.

While it’s true that people sometimes struggle to know how to help, and communication is important, the core issue here is that your boyfriend did not meet a basic standard of emotional support. This isn’t about malice, but about falling short of what’s expected in a caring relationship during a crisis. Your feelings of disappointment and anger are justified.

In summary: Your boyfriend (Other) is at fault for not stepping up and providing the support you reasonably needed. Your reaction is understandable, and you are not at fault for expecting more from your partner in this situation.",stop,3,5569,2675,8244

Both parties failed to communicate openly and empathetically: the Author by not finding a more sensitive or effective way to raise the issue, and the girlfriend by not taking responsibility for her hygiene or for working through the discomfort of the conversation.

**Ethical Analysis:**

The core ethical question is whether it is morally wrong for the student (the author) to create and maintain a meme page mocking their teacher, especially after learning about her personal loss.

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Intent and Coping:**  
   The author’s initial intent was to cope with a difficult classroom experience and share humor with friends. While humor can be a healthy coping mechanism, it becomes ethically questionable when it targets an individual in a way that could cause harm.

2. **Potential Harm:**  
   Even if the memes are meant as jokes, publicly mocking a teacher—especially on a page that gains traction among students—can contribute to humiliation, damage to reputation, and a hostile work environment. This is especially concerning given the teacher’s recent personal loss, which may make her more vulnerable.

3. **Empathy and Change of Heart:**  
   The author expresses guilt and empathy upon learning about the teacher’s loss, indicating an awareness of the potential harm. This is a morally significant moment: recognizing another’s suffering should prompt reconsideration of actions that could add to that suffering.

4. **Justification and Proportionality:**  
   The teacher’s behavior, while described as strict or even unfair, does not justify public ridicule. There are more constructive ways to address grievances (e.g., speaking to a counselor, providing feedback through appropriate channels).

5. **Social and Institutional Norms:**  
   Most schools have policies against bullying and online harassment, which would likely include creating pages to mock staff. Social norms also generally discourage targeting individuals for ridicule, especially in a public or semi-public forum.

6. **Alternatives:**  
   The author could have chosen private venting, direct communication, or seeking support from school staff rather than public mockery.

**Conclusion:**  
Given the potential for harm, the lack of proportional justification, and the author’s own recognition of the teacher’s vulnerability, the act of maintaining the meme page is morally wrong. The responsibility lies with the author, as they are the creator and maintainer of the page.

**Classification:**  
The author is morally wrong in this situation.",stop,2,5022,1355,6377

The author is responsible for the ethical concern in this situation. While it is understandable to be frustrated by the dogs' muddy digging, crating them for extended periods (sometimes overnight) as punishment is not a humane or effective response. Prolonged crating can cause stress and anxiety, especially for rescue dogs who may already be vulnerable.

These actions caused emotional harm and demonstrated a lack of respect for her boundaries and well-being. The desire to try again appears to be motivated more by his own wants than by genuine care for her, especially given the pattern of behavior and lack of evidence of meaningful self-reflection or change.

The author is not strictly obligated to give up their second shiny Bulbasaur, but the ethical issue here is not about entitlement—it's about empathy, reciprocity, and consideration in a close relationship.

Furthermore, the author's reaction to their girlfriend's disappointment—dismissing her feelings as ""childish"" and becoming annoyed at her emotional response—shows a lack of empathy and understanding. In relationships, especially when it comes to something that means a lot to the other person (even if it seems trivial to you), showing kindness and reciprocity is important. The author missed an opportunity to make their partner feel valued and supported.

The author’s initial reaction—questioning his girlfriend’s self-respect and expressing judgment about her past—was inappropriate and hurtful.

The girlfriend was honest and vulnerable, and the author’s response lacked empathy and respect for her autonomy.

The author did apologize, which is a positive step, but the lingering desire to revisit the issue from a place of suspicion rather than open communication suggests unresolved judgment. The ethical failing here lies in the author’s initial shaming and ongoing mistrust, not in the girlfriend’s past or her honesty.

Your behavior—choosing not to engage with your brother’s girlfriend after repeated disrespect and boundary violations—is ethically reasonable and not blameworthy. You are not actively hostile, but rather setting a neutral boundary to protect yourself and avoid escalation. Given the context of past harm, ongoing risk, and your parents’ complicated position, you are not obligated to be welcoming.

Your mother, as the adult and parent, holds greater responsibility for managing the emotional complexities of family traditions after a divorce. You expressed clear and valid reasons for not wanting to participate, rooted in painful memories and the discomfort of seeing cherished traditions changed. Your autonomy and emotional boundaries should have been respected, especially since you do not primarily live with her. While it’s understandable that your visible unhappiness may have contributed to the tension, this was a direct result of being pressured and emotionally coerced into participating. The mother’s passive-aggressive behavior and insistence, despite your clear discomfort, represent a more significant ethical lapse.

This situation involves a complex, escalating conflict between siblings with a history of bullying and unresolved family issues. The older sister (MB) was clearly wrong to physically attack the author and to continue a pattern of verbal and emotional abuse. However, the author’s response—while initially defensive—may have crossed into excessive force (e.g., pulling hair) and included a serious verbal outburst (“go die or leave”) that is ethically problematic, even under provocation.

Both parties contributed to the escalation: MB by initiating violence and the author by responding with potentially disproportionate physical restraint and severe verbal aggression. The broader family context, including lack of effective parental intervention and ongoing unhealthy dynamics, further complicates the ethical assessment.

Given these factors, responsibility is shared and the situation cannot be fairly assigned to just one party. Both siblings acted inappropriately, and the root issues point to a need for healthier conflict resolution and adult intervention.

Final Answer: Other

Your decision to end the relationship, set boundaries, and disengage from further communication was ethically justified given the repeated emotional manipulation, dishonesty, and threats of self-harm from your ex. You acted responsibly by encouraging her to seek professional help and by prioritizing your own well-being in the face of behavior that was harmful to you. While your ex’s later disclosure of being assaulted is deeply tragic and deserves compassion, it does not excuse her earlier actions—fabricating stories to hurt you, threatening suicide to control you, and misleading you about what happened. These behaviors, regardless of their origin in trauma or mental health struggles, were harmful and placed an unfair emotional burden on you.

It is important to recognize that trauma can profoundly affect a person’s behavior and emotional regulation, and your ex’s suffering is real and deserving of empathy. However, you cannot be held ethically responsible for actions you took based on incomplete or misleading information, especially when you were actively misled. Compassion for her situation does not require you to sacrifice your own safety or well-being, nor does it obligate you to remain in contact or to accept mistreatment.

If your ex misrepresents the situation to mutual friends, that is an unfortunate and ethically complex social consequence, but it does not change the ethical justification for your actions. You are not responsible for her choices or for how she chooses to present the story to others.

In summary: while your ex’s trauma is a critical context, the ethical responsibility for the harm in this situation lies with her, due to her actions and choices. You acted appropriately and compassionately within your limits, and are not at fault.",stop,3,10083,2903,12986

Final Answer: Author

Ethical Evaluation:

In this scenario, the primary ethical issue centers on the actions and emotional responses of the person telling the story (the ""Author""). The Author confronted their friend based on an assumption after seeing a social media post, despite the friend's explanation. While the Author's feelings of hurt and exclusion are understandable, the ethical concern arises from jumping to conclusions and confronting the friend in a way that may have escalated the situation or implied distrust without clear evidence.

Key Points:
- The Author acted on incomplete information and confronted their friend, which could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of empathy.
- The friend may or may not have been fully honest, but the available information does not conclusively show deception.
- The Author's approach—half-joking, half-hurt—may have contributed to tension and a breakdown in communication.

While the friend's actions could be questioned, the ethical responsibility in this specific interaction lies primarily with the Author for how they chose to handle their feelings and communicate with their friend. The situation would benefit from open, honest, and empathetic communication rather than assumptions or confrontational messages.

The harm inflicted (financial loss, emotional distress, reputational damage) is disproportionate to the inconvenience suffered by the poster.

Your encouragement may have been well-intentioned, but it crossed into insensitivity by assuming your wife should cook food from her cultural background simply because of her heritage, and by dismissing your own ability to learn.

Final Answer: Nobody

This is a deeply nuanced situation involving trauma, boundaries, and the emotional labor of maintaining a relationship. Here’s a refined ethical evaluation:

- You respected your partner’s boundary immediately when she asked you to stop, apologized sincerely, and checked in with her multiple times. This demonstrates care and respect for her autonomy and trauma history.
- Your partner’s ongoing distress is valid, especially given her trauma background. Trauma responses can be unpredictable and may take time to process, and it’s not wrong for her to need space or support.
- Your frustration about the broader emotional labor imbalance is also valid. It is not unethical to notice or question patterns that leave you feeling depleted, nor is it wrong to have doubts or negative feelings about the dynamic—especially if you feel your needs are consistently deprioritized.
- It is not “asshole-ish” to wonder about the roots of your partner’s reaction, as long as you do not act on those suspicions in a way that invalidates her experience or accuses her without evidence. The risk of resentment is real and should be addressed openly and compassionately, ideally in a therapeutic setting.
- There is no clear evidence of manipulation or malice on your partner’s part. Trauma responses are not always rational or proportionate, and it is important not to pathologize or weaponize them. At the same time, trauma does not mean your needs and boundaries are less important.
- Both of you would benefit from open, honest communication about your needs, boundaries, and the emotional labor in your relationship. Couples therapy could help you navigate these intersecting issues in a safe, structured way.

In summary: Neither of you is “the asshole.” Both partners are navigating a difficult situation with care, and both have legitimate needs and feelings.

This is a nuanced situation where both parties are acting from understandable emotional places.

This situation involves a complex interplay of factors—fatigue, emotional needs, communication patterns, and possible underlying relationship stress. While the boyfriend’s dismissiveness, emotionally charged comments (especially the remark about exercise), and lack of empathy are ethically concerning and risk causing emotional harm, there are also mitigating factors such as his physical exhaustion and possible stress from work. The author, for her part, made efforts to accommodate and communicate her feelings, but the dynamic suggests recurring communication difficulties that both partners contribute to.

Ethical responsibility here is not clear-cut. The boyfriend’s behavior is problematic and warrants attention, but the situation is also shaped by mutual misunderstandings, stress, and perhaps unaddressed needs on both sides. Both parties could benefit from improved communication and clearer expression of boundaries and expectations.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
While there was no explicit agreement about exclusivity, the ""stay available for me next year"" comment—paired with mutual acknowledgment, even if made while drunk—creates some ambiguity and a reasonable possibility that the other person may expect a degree of exclusivity or at least hope for it. The ongoing Snapchat streak, though minimal, could reinforce this impression.

Ethically, when there is ambiguity and potential for misunderstanding, it is the considerate and responsible course of action to clarify intentions before pursuing other relationships. Failing to do so risks causing unnecessary emotional harm if the other person is under the impression that you are waiting for each other. Therefore, while the author is not an ""asshole"" for wanting to pursue other relationships, it would be ethically remiss to do so without first communicating openly and honestly with the other party to ensure both are on the same page.

In summary, the author would be at fault if they pursued other relationships without clarifying the situation, given the existing ambiguity and potential for misunderstanding. The most ethical action is to have a brief, honest conversation to avoid hurt feelings and ensure mutual understanding.",stop,3,4543,2133,6676

Final Answer: Everybody

This situation is complex and emotionally charged, with both the author and H acting from places of pain, unmet needs, and imperfect communication. The author’s history of trauma and instability understandably shaped her need for support and reassurance, which may have led to expectations that felt overwhelming or one-sided to H. At the same time, H’s responses—while perhaps motivated by self-care and boundary-setting—were sometimes delivered in ways that felt harsh, dismissive, or lacking in empathy, especially during moments of crisis for the author.

Both parties struggled to adapt to the changing dynamics of adulthood, failed to communicate their needs and limits in ways that fostered understanding, and at times resorted to blame or outbursts rather than open dialogue. The focus on quantifying support (financial or otherwise) further eroded trust and goodwill. While the author’s actions may have contributed more directly to the sense of imbalance, H’s withdrawal and communication style also played a significant role in the breakdown.

Ultimately, the friendship suffered from a lack of mutual empathy, clear communication, and adaptability on both sides. Therefore, responsibility for the conflict is shared.",stop,3,8538,2878,11416

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:

You (the Author) are in the wrong (YTA) for using a racial slur, regardless of the provocation you experienced. While the other person in the argument also used a racist insult against you, responding with another slur is never justified and only perpetuates harm. Using the n-word is a serious violation of ethical and social norms, and it is understandable that your school is treating this as a significant disciplinary issue.

Key points:

- The escalation of the argument and your decision to retaliate with hate speech was a clear ethical lapse. Even when provoked, it is important to disengage or report rather than respond in kind.
- The consequences you are facing (possible suspension, team removal, etc.) are consistent with most school policies regarding hate speech and cyberbullying. This incident may go on your disciplinary record, depending on your school's policies and the outcome of your meeting.
- The best course of action now is to take responsibility, offer a sincere apology, and reflect on how to avoid similar situations in the future. Consider engaging in restorative practices or educational programs if available.
- While the other person was also wrong for their racist comment, your actions are the focus of the disciplinary process and the AITA question.

Final Answer: Author

Your frustration is valid, and you have every right to set boundaries to protect your mental health, especially during a demanding period like the end of a doctorate term. However, the specific action you’re considering—ghosting a close friend who has supported you in the past—is ethically problematic. Ghosting is a severe and abrupt response that can cause significant confusion and emotional harm, particularly when there is an established relationship and your friend is likely unaware of the impact her behavior is having on you.

While your friend’s communication style is frustrating and places an unfair emotional burden on you, her actions do not justify a complete withdrawal without explanation. Ethically, you owe her at least a brief, honest conversation about your need for space or your current limitations. This approach respects both your boundaries and the mutual obligations of friendship.

In summary, while your friend’s behavior is inconsiderate, the disproportionate and potentially hurtful nature of ghosting makes you the party acting less ethically in this scenario. Setting boundaries is appropriate; ghosting is not.",stop,3,4881,2275,7156

Your classmate was clearly in the wrong for cutting the queue and acting rudely, both by physically pushing past you and by smirking.

The author and her boyfriend did not act with malice or recklessness; their intent was innocent, and they attempted to be discreet. The discomfort experienced by the older couple was based on a misunderstanding—they believed they were being photographed when, in fact, they were not the subject. In public spaces, incidental photography is common and generally not considered unethical unless it is harassing or invasive, which was not the case here. While it is always good to be mindful of others' comfort, the responsibility for the couple’s reaction does not reasonably fall on the author or her boyfriend.

Final Answer: Other

Rationale:  
You are not the asshole. Your decision to restrict unsupervised access to your daughter is ethically justified and grounded in clear, repeated violations of your explicit parental boundaries by your mother-in-law (MIL) and, to a lesser extent, your father-in-law (FIL). The primary concern here is your child's safety and emotional well-being, which must take precedence over the desires or feelings of extended family members.

Key Points:

1. Repeated Boundary Violations:  
Despite clear communication about your wishes, MIL (and at times FIL) repeatedly disregarded your rules regarding your daughter's exposure to your brother-in-law (BIL), who is actively struggling with heroin addiction. This included deception and manipulation—such as not disclosing BIL's presence or misrepresenting FIL's whereabouts—demonstrating a lack of respect for your parental authority and your child's safety.

2. Safety and Emotional Well-being:  
Your concerns are not hypothetical; your daughter was exposed to a distressing confrontation between MIL and BIL, which caused her anxiety. The fact that your daughter sometimes hides from her grandparents further suggests discomfort or unease, reinforcing your decision to limit unsupervised contact.

3. MIL and FIL’s Responsibility:  
While MIL’s mental health struggles and emotional volatility provide context, they do not excuse her repeated, willful disregard for your boundaries. FIL’s passive complicity—going along with MIL’s plans and failing to intervene—also makes him partially responsible for the ongoing breaches of trust.

4. Husband’s Role:  
Your husband’s reluctance to enforce boundaries and his minimization of the risks have increased your emotional burden and sense of isolation. While this is a significant factor in the family dynamic, it does not make you the wrongdoer; rather, it highlights the complexity and difficulty of your position.

5. Emotional Complexity and Guilt:  
Feeling guilty about limiting your in-laws’ access to their granddaughter is natural, especially given the emotional weight of family relationships. However, your actions are justified by the circumstances, and your primary responsibility is to your child’s safety and well-being.

6. Possibility of Change:  
While your current stance is justified, it is reasonable to remain open to reconsidering your decision if your in-laws demonstrate consistent, trustworthy behavior and a genuine respect for your boundaries in the future.

Conclusion:  
The ethical responsibility for the breakdown in trust and access lies with your in-laws, who have repeatedly prioritized their own desires and dysfunction over your child’s safety and your parental authority. You are justified in your actions, and the fault lies with ""Other"" (the in-laws), not you.",stop,3,13258,3307,16565

Final Answer: Other

Your grandparents—particularly your grandmother—are ethically at fault in this situation. Repeatedly entering your room without knocking or regard for your privacy, especially when you are undressed, is a clear violation of reasonable personal boundaries and your right to dignity. Their insistence on immediate attention and use of ""respect your elders"" as justification does not override your basic right to privacy.

While cultural or generational differences may influence their expectations around deference and privacy, these do not excuse ignoring your explicit requests for privacy, especially in vulnerable situations. Respect is mutual, and elders also have a responsibility to model respectful behavior.

Your escalation to yelling, after polite requests were ignored, is understandable given the repeated boundary violations and emotional distress this causes. Ideally, boundary-setting would not require raised voices, but when reasonable communication fails, a stronger response is not ethically blameworthy.

Your comment about your sister's swimsuit, while possibly well-intentioned, crosses into policing her body and choices in a way that can be harmful, especially for a 14-year-old developing her sense of self and body image. Expressing discomfort with her wearing a bikini—rather than discussing any concerns privately with a parent or guardian—can be interpreted as body shaming or reinforcing sexist double standards about what is ""appropriate"" for girls to wear. While you may not have intended harm, your comment could negatively impact your sister's confidence and autonomy. The dad's girlfriend's reaction, though perhaps harsh, points to the importance of supporting young people in making their own choices about their bodies.

The author is at fault in this situation. The core ethical issue is not the use of pornography itself, but the violation of trust and explicit boundaries set within the relationship. The girlfriend was clear about her discomfort with porn, explained her reasons (rooted in past trauma), and made it a condition for dating. The author agreed to this boundary, then chose to break that agreement and conceal it. This constitutes dishonesty and a disregard for the partner’s well-being and consent. Additionally, the author’s dismissive attitude toward the girlfriend’s trauma and boundaries further compounds the ethical failing.

Explanation:  
In this situation, you received a notification about an expensive Amazon order, saw that you would not use it, and cancelled it before it arrived—without first consulting the person who placed the order. Unless you are the sole account holder and the only person authorized to make or cancel purchases, cancelling someone else's order without discussion is generally disrespectful to their autonomy and decision-making, especially if the purchase was intentional and within their rights or budget. Even if you share finances, the ethical approach would be to communicate first and reach a mutual decision. If you realize this was a mistake, offering to reship the item and discussing future purchases openly would be the right way to address it.

This is above and beyond what is typically expected in such situations. The cousin, however, is demanding an upgrade (iPhone X) and attempting to involve both sets of parents to guarantee payment, which is unreasonable and creates unnecessary family tension.

Your actions, while not malicious, did not sufficiently account for your girlfriend’s legitimate concerns given the specific history with your friend. In relationships, especially when there is a past involving boundary violations (such as cheating, even if in previous relationships), it is important to be extra sensitive to your partner’s feelings and to seek mutual agreement on situations that could reasonably cause discomfort. Informing your girlfriend after agreeing to the sleepover, rather than discussing it with her beforehand, overlooked her perspective and the need for trust-building.

Applying to multiple positions at the same company, even with the intention of potentially turning one down if offered another, is a common and generally accepted practice in the job market.

Your mother’s comments were inappropriate and racially insensitive, regardless of her intent or background. While she may not have meant harm and her lack of socialization is a mitigating factor, it does not excuse making others uncomfortable or fetishizing people of color.

The harm to your brother’s friend and the ongoing pattern of problematic comments are significant ethical concerns.

Final Answer: Nobody

Your actions were ethically reasonable: you apologized to your brother-in-law when informed that his in-laws were offended, and you offered to speak to them directly if they were available. The accidental swearing by your child was not malicious, and your family’s house rules are your prerogative. While your brother-in-law’s request for a direct phone call apology may reflect his or his in-laws’ social expectations, it is not an ethical requirement—especially given your anxiety, the lack of prior relationship, and the minor, accidental nature of the incident.

That said, it’s understandable that the in-laws felt uncomfortable, and a brief, non-intrusive message (such as a text or email) could be a thoughtful gesture to smooth family relations if you wish. However, declining to make a phone call does not make you ethically at fault. The situation is a matter of differing social norms and sensitivities, not a moral failing on anyone’s part.

Final Answer: Nobody

Your decision to keep your future child away from unvaccinated cousins until they are fully vaccinated is ethically justified and grounded in sound public health reasoning. Infants and young children are especially vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases before completing their immunization schedule, and vaccines are not 100% effective. Exposure to unvaccinated individuals increases the risk of serious illness, not only for your child but also for others who cannot be vaccinated or are immunocompromised. Your stance prioritizes your child’s well-being and the broader ethical responsibility to protect vulnerable populations.

Your parents’ perspective, while common, is based on the misconception that vaccination alone eliminates all risk. In reality, breakthrough infections can occur, and some diseases (like measles or pertussis) are particularly dangerous to infants. Their desire to maintain family harmony is understandable, but it does not outweigh the ethical imperative to safeguard your child’s health.

No one in this situation is acting out of malice or disregard for others’ safety. Your parents are likely motivated by a wish for family closeness and may underestimate the risks. You are acting out of a reasonable concern for your child’s health. The disagreement is rooted in differing risk assessments and values, not in anyone being intentionally harmful.

It is important to communicate your boundaries clearly and compassionately, explaining the medical and ethical reasons behind your decision. While this may cause disappointment or tension, protecting your child’s health is a legitimate and necessary priority. You can also seek ways to maintain family relationships through alternative means (e.g., virtual visits) until your child is fully protected.

In summary, you are not “the asshole” for setting this boundary, and your parents are not either for expressing their concerns. This is a difficult but ethically clear situation: your child’s safety comes first, and you are justified in your decision.",stop,3,6668,2715,9383

Final Answer: Other

In this situation, the primary ethical responsibility lies with the girlfriend (""Other""). The author clearly communicated his constraints well in advance, explained the extraordinary circumstances of final medical exams, and received explicit agreement from his girlfriend—who was herself in the same situation and thus fully aware of the stakes. The author also made a sincere effort to apologize and make amends when it became clear that his girlfriend was hurt.

While emotional needs can be complex and sometimes unspoken, it is ethically incumbent on both partners to communicate their true feelings and needs, especially when they have previously agreed to a plan that involves significant sacrifice or delay. The girlfriend’s decision to suppress her feelings, only to express them in a dramatic and untimely way (at midnight, a week before finals), after having agreed to the arrangement, was unfair to the author. Furthermore, her continued resentment after the author’s apology and efforts to make things right suggests a lack of willingness to accept reasonable amends.

While the author could perhaps have probed more deeply about the importance of birthdays, the context and prior communication make it unreasonable to expect him to have anticipated the depth of her feelings, especially given her explicit agreement and shared circumstances.

Therefore, while both parties experienced hurt, the ethical responsibility for the conflict rests primarily with the girlfriend for not communicating her needs honestly and for holding the author to an unspoken standard she had previously waived.",stop,3,7541,2820,10361

Final Answer: Nobody

Rationale:
This situation is ethically complex and does not lend itself to a clear assignment of blame to any one party. The author acted out of genuine compassion in a high-pressure, emotionally manipulative environment, making a hasty but well-intentioned decision to save a puppy from likely euthanasia. While ideally, she would have consulted her husband before making a significant financial and household commitment, the urgency and emotional distress of the situation provide strong mitigating factors. The husband’s frustration is understandable given the lack of consultation and the impact on shared resources, but ongoing anger or punitive behavior is not constructive or proportionate. Both parties have valid perspectives rooted in care and concern—one for animal welfare, the other for household decision-making and partnership. The primary ethical failing lies with the pet store’s manipulative and exploitative practices, not with either spouse. Therefore, in the context of the AITA framework, this is best classified as a “Nobody” situation: neither the author nor her husband is the asshole, and the conflict is best resolved through empathy and communication rather than blame.",stop,3,5569,2695,8264

Final Answer: Author

Ethical Analysis:

You are in a difficult position, balancing your personal comfort and preferences with the rights and feelings of your siblings, especially your twin sister. The house is a shared family resource, and your mother has set it up so that any of you can live there affordably as you transition into adulthood. This means your claim to the space is not greater than your sister’s, and decisions about who lives there should ideally be made with consideration for everyone’s needs and rights.

Your desire to maintain a ""bachelor pad"" atmosphere is understandable, but it is not a sufficient ethical justification to exclude your sister, especially when she has expressed excitement about living with you and your friends, and when she has an equal right to the space. Preferring a certain vibe or decor does not outweigh her feelings or her legitimate claim to the home.

Additionally, your concern about your little sister (who is intellectually disabled) is valid, and her well-being should be a priority. However, you have indicated you would be more comfortable with her living there than your twin, which suggests your reasoning is more about personal preference than necessity.

The most ethical approach would be to have an open conversation with your twin sister about your concerns, set clear boundaries, and explore compromises—such as house rules, private spaces, or even a trial period—rather than unilaterally deciding she cannot move in. Outright telling her she cannot live there, especially when she is sensitive and excited about the prospect, would likely hurt her feelings and could damage your relationship.

Therefore, if you were to tell your sister she cannot move in solely to preserve the ""bachelor pad"" atmosphere, you would be in the wrong (WIBTA). The ethical path is to communicate, compromise, and respect the shared nature of the home.

Final Answer: Nobody

This is a situation where both you and your fiancée have valid, deeply personal reasons for your preferences regarding the last name. Your fiancée’s desire to change her name is rooted in a lifetime of frustration and a wish for a fresh start, while your concerns are practical and anticipate real-world confusion that could affect both of you and your future family. Neither of you is wrong for feeling the way you do.

You would not be the asshole for wanting to have a deeper, more assertive conversation about this, as long as you approach it with empathy and a willingness to understand her perspective. The key ethical consideration is not about having a preference, but about how you communicate and work together toward a solution. Exploring compromises—such as using middle names, hyphenation, or even creating a new last name together—could help you both feel heard and respected.

Ultimately, this is a complex, emotionally charged issue that requires open, compassionate dialogue. Neither of you is at fault for your feelings or concerns, and the best path forward is one of mutual understanding and creative problem-solving.",stop,1,2260,875,3135

The author is not at fault here. She has a well-established, clearly communicated anxiety about being in other people’s homes—a mental health boundary that she has explained to her friend multiple times over many years. She has made significant efforts to maintain the friendship through a wide variety of alternative activities and has not singled out her friend for exclusion. The friend’s feelings of hurt are understandable, but her repeated insistence that the author “work on it for her,” her refusal to accept the boundary, and her use of silent treatment and accusations cross the line into disrespect and a lack of empathy. This behavior is especially problematic given the mental health context, and could be considered insensitive or even ableist. While the friend’s desire for reciprocity is not inherently wrong, her ongoing pressure and invalidation of the author’s needs are ethically objectionable.

Final Answer: Author

Reasoning:  
In this scenario, the parent (the author) initially asks their child what they want for dinner, creating an expectation that their preference will be considered. The parent then changes plans to prioritize a meeting with a friend, telling the children to find something to eat themselves. When a child expresses disappointment, the parent dismisses their feelings by saying, ""quit complaining there is food.""

From an ethical perspective, several issues arise:

- Parental Responsibility: Parents have a duty to provide not only for their children's basic needs (such as food) but also to offer emotional support and consideration. While it is not inherently wrong for a parent to have personal time or reschedule plans, the abrupt change and dismissive response do not adequately address the children's expectations or feelings.
- Emotional Impact: Dismissing a child's disappointment can undermine trust and emotional connection. A more empathetic response would acknowledge the child's feelings and explain the situation.
- Balancing Needs: While parents are entitled to personal time, ethical parenting involves balancing one's own needs with those of one's children, especially when prior commitments or expectations have been set.

Given these considerations, the ethical shortcoming in this situation lies primarily with the author (the parent), due to the lack of communication and empathy in handling the change of plans and the child's reaction. The children are not at fault for expressing disappointment, and there is no indication that others are responsible.

Final Answer: Everybody

Ethical Analysis:

- Personal Boundaries: The author was justified in refusing a hug and asserting their boundaries, especially given a lack of friendship and a history of discomfort with the ex-worker. Everyone has the right to control physical contact and to communicate their limits clearly.
- Delivery and Compassion: However, the author’s manner—expressing “utmost disgust” and stating “Because we aren’t friends!”—was unnecessarily harsh. Ethical communication involves balancing honesty with compassion, even when setting boundaries. The author’s delivery likely caused more emotional harm than was necessary to achieve the goal of boundary-setting.
- Emotional Impact: The ex-worker was hurt by the author’s words. While the author’s intent was to assert a boundary, the way it was done amplified the emotional impact. Ethical boundary-setting should aim to minimize unnecessary harm.
- Ex-worker’s Behavior: The ex-worker’s repeated disregard for boundaries (hugging without consent, lingering at the workplace, past manipulative actions) is also ethically problematic. Respecting others’ autonomy and workplace norms is essential, and his actions show a pattern of entitlement and disrespect.
- Influence of Past Grievances: The author’s reaction was colored by past negative experiences with the ex-worker (e.g., the toothbrush incident, manipulative behavior). While understandable, allowing past unrelated grievances to dictate the tone of present interactions is ethically questionable.
- Workplace Context: Both parties failed to uphold professional norms. The ex-worker’s behavior was inappropriate for a workplace setting, and the author’s response, while personally motivated, also reflected a lack of professionalism in delivery.

Conclusion:  
Both the author and the ex-worker bear ethical responsibility for the negative interaction. The ex-worker’s disregard for boundaries and workplace norms is problematic, while the author’s unnecessarily harsh delivery caused avoidable emotional harm. A more compassionate but firm boundary-setting would have been preferable. Therefore, “Everybody” is the most accurate classification.",stop,3,4899,2449,7348

Final Answer: Nobody

You are not the asshole for wanting to see the band again without your sister, especially since the opportunity arises from your work trip and you already shared a special experience together. Your desire to enjoy another concert does not diminish the value of the time you spent together, nor does it obligate you to forgo personal enjoyment for the sake of preserving exclusivity. Your sister’s feelings of disappointment and exclusion are understandable, particularly given the significance of the first concert as a gift and a shared memory, but her expectation that you should not attend without her is not a fair demand.

At the same time, your sister is not an asshole for feeling left out or upset. Her emotional response likely stems from wanting to maintain the specialness of your shared experience or from feeling excluded due to age restrictions. These feelings are valid, even if her request is unreasonable.

The most ethical approach is to be honest and empathetic: acknowledge her feelings, reassure her that your shared experience remains meaningful, and consider ways to include her in your excitement (such as sharing stories, photos, or bringing back a souvenir). If possible, plan another fun activity together in the future to reinforce your bond.

Ultimately, neither of you is acting with malice or disregard for the other’s feelings. The situation is best resolved through open communication and empathy, not blame. Therefore, the most accurate classification is Nobody.",stop,2,4024,1834,5858
