She pooped in the car while ...",Other,Nobody,0.8,0.8333333333333334,True,"Reasoning: The author responded defensively but not abusively to unsolicited, repeated comments from a stranger; while cultural norms may expect more deference to elders, the author did not escalate or act with clear malice, and the old man was intruding into their parenting uninvited. The situation is mostly a clash of boundaries and generational expectations, but the author’s response was not egregiously rude.

887,"RSVP had 3 options: Yes, Maybe, No. I replied Maybe. We’re both in our mid-20s. I own a small business. Everyone thinks since I’m my own boss I can just close up shop whenever I want. I can’t, I have ...",Other,Other,0.75,0.6,False,"Reasoning: The author communicated their uncertainty due to legitimate work obligations and responded honestly to the RSVP; the other person’s angry reaction to a reasonable “Maybe” is unfair and disregards the author’s circumstances.

889," I've been with my wife for almost 4 years. We have one child together, and she's pregnant with our second. She's a great mother and partner, and I love her to death. She is currently about 8 months p...",Other,Other,0.75,0.5333333333333333,False,"Reasoning: The author is acting out of concern for both his wife and unborn child, providing support and reminders about a serious medical condition; while his wife is under stress, her refusal to monitor her health puts both herself and the baby at risk. Her reaction is understandable given pregnancy stress, but the responsibility to manage gestational diabetes is ultimately hers, and his reminders are reasonable.

He was the friend ...",Author,Nobody,0.78,0.9473684210526315,True,"Reasoning: You made reasonable efforts to include your guest, introducing him to others and suggesting activities, but he declined to participate and refused your suggestions. While it may have been blunt to ask him to leave, you are not at fault for not wanting to babysit an uncooperative guest at your own party.

However, the spirit of Secret Santa is anonymity, and trying to circumvent that—even out of frustration—undermines the event’s intended structure. The real fault lies with the person who didn’t deliver on time, not with you for wanting information.
