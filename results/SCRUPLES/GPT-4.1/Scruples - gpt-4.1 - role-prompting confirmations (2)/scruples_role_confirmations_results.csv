While the mother may have acted dishonestly in the past, the author’s choice to disclose sensitive information in this manner is generally considered inappropriate and likely to cause unnecessary harm and distress. The author had other, more considerate options, such as approaching the mother privately or seeking legal advice if he genuinely believed he was the father and wanted to be involved.

This is a clear case of both parties engaging in unethical behavior: the student is making a false or exaggerated accusation as leverage, and the teacher is offering an inappropriate quid pro quo to avoid being reported.

The author intentionally broke this agreement, albeit with good intentions, by surprising his partner with flowers.

Under ordinary contemporary norms, keeping one's word and respecting mutual agreements in relationships is considered morally important, even if the intent is positive. The partner's upset reaction is understandable, as she may have felt her wishes and the agreement were disregarded.

Thi...,Author,Everybody,0.9,0.5,False,"Based on ordinary contemporary norms, public flatulence—especially repeated and obvious—can be considered rude, particularly in a confined social setting like a bar. However, shaming or publicly confronting someone in a harsh or profane manner is also generally considered socially unacceptable, as it can escalate conflict and create discomfort for others. The bartender's reaction, while perhaps excessive, was motivated by a desire to maintain a welcoming environment for all patrons.

Given these factors, both the author (for their confrontational and profane response) and the person repeatedly farting (for inconsiderate behavior) share some responsibility for the unpleasantness of the situation. The bartender's reaction, while strong, is within the bounds of someone trying to manage a social space.

The author is considering reporting a neighbor for running an unlicensed auto repair business that is negatively impacting parking in the area. The author is aware of the cultural and racial dynamics at play, particularly as a newer, white resident in a majority Hispanic neighborhood.

Key ethical considerations:
- The neighbor is likely violating zoning laws and possibly tax laws, which is generally considered wrong from a civic perspective.
- However, the neighbor may be doing so out of economic necessity, and this practice may be a longstanding, tolerated part of the community.
- The author is not yet at fault for merely considering reporting, but would be if they acted in a way that disregarded the context and potential harm to the neighbor and community.
- The parking issue is a legitimate concern, but the author’s potential action could be seen as contributing to gentrification and displacement, which carries its own moral weight.

Given the information, the person currently at fault for the parking problem and the legal violations is the neighbor running the business. However, the author is not yet at fault for merely contemplating action, and the broader context of gentrification complicates the moral landscape.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

While the author is fulfilling legal obligations, the refusal to provide any additional support—financial, practical, or emotional—when the child is facing significant health challenges, is widely seen as morally insufficient.

- X initiates by attempting to splash you with ink (minor aggression).
- You retaliate by throwing X's eraser in the garbage (retaliatory, but not physically harmful).
- You attempt to retrieve the eraser, but use Y's paper without permission (minor disrespect of property).
- Y responds with significant physical aggression: pushing you, breaking your pen, and punching you.
- You finally slap Y in response to being punched.

Under ordinary contemporary moral norms, minor property violations (using paper without permission, throwing an eraser away) are not considered justification for physical violence. Y's escalation to physical aggression (pushing, breaking your pen, punching you) is disproportionate and morally unacceptable. Your slap, while also violent, was in direct response to being punched and could be seen as self-defense or a reaction to being physically harmed.

Given the chain of events, all parties contributed to the escalation, but Y's actions were the most egregious. However, you and X also engaged in minor wrongs, and your slap, while reactive, was still a physical act of aggression.

The author already paid Olivia back for their own share. There is no indication that the author agreed to pay for Judy in advance, nor that Judy expected this. Olivia’s request seems to be based on the author’s financial situation rather than any prior agreement or obligation.

Under ordinary contemporary moral norms, it is generally not considered acceptable to expect someone to pay for another adult’s discretionary expenses (like a trip) simply because they have savings, unless there was a prior agreement or explicit offer. The responsibility for paying for the trip should fall on Judy, or, if Olivia chose to cover Judy, that would be Olivia’s voluntary choice.

However, the way the author expresses their concerns—especially at a moment of celebration, and by refusing to attend the wedding—can be seen as insensitive and potentially hurtful. At the same time, the friend (Kylie) asked for the author's honest opinion, which the author provided, albeit bluntly.

While the author’s concerns about the relationship may be valid, the manner and timing of their expression, and the refusal to support the friend at a significant life event, are generally considered socially and morally insensitive. However, the friend also bears some responsibility for pressing the author for an opinion and reacting harshly to honesty.

Given these factors, but considering that the author escalated the situation by refusing to attend the wedding and expressing their views in a way that was likely to cause pain, contemporary norms would place more fault on the author for how they handled the situation, rather than for having concerns.

The partner's insistence that the day is ""not all about you"" and framing the situation as the author ""ruining"" the day further suggests an unreasonable escalation.

However, insisting on a particular form of affection as a non-negotiable requirement can become problematic if it disregards the comfort, boundaries, or autonomy of the other person. In this scenario, the author expresses a strong need for physical affection and seems to make it a central expectation in relationships.

From the information provided, there is no clear evidence that the author is coercing or pressuring partners beyond expressing a strong preference.

Under ordinary contemporary moral norms, knowingly allowing an innocent person to be falsely accused—especially of something as serious as racism and causing an accident—without intervening is considered morally wrong. While the girlfriend's actions are clearly unethical, the author's inaction in the face of clear injustice also carries moral responsibility. 

Therefore, both the girlfriend (for lying and making false accusations) and the author (for failing to correct a serious injustice) are at fault.

...",Nobody,Other,0.9,0.6,False,"Based on the information provided, the author describes feeling left out and replaced by new friends in their social group. The author does not report any active wrongdoing toward the group, nor do they describe any overtly malicious actions by the group, but the group did begin to exclude the author from activities and conversations. The author also expresses self-doubt and concern about being at fault, but their actions (sitting out of volleyball, not interfering with others' enjoyment, planning to leave the group respectfully) do not violate ordinary moral norms.

Exclusion and ignoring someone in a friend group, especially without communication or explanation, is generally considered inconsiderate and can be emotionally hurtful. While friend groups can change and people can drift apart, basic respect and inclusion are still expected under contemporary norms.

Therefore, the primary fault lies with the other members of the group for excluding the author without communication or consideration.

The family's objections are rooted in traditional gender roles, which are not universally accepted as moral requirements in modern society.

While it is understandable that the author feels insecure due to her past experiences and the message from the boyfriend's friend, intentionally testing a partner in a deceptive way (without open communication) is generally considered morally questionable. However, the primary fault in this scenario lies with the boyfriend (if the friend's claim is true) or the friend (if the claim is false and intended to cause drama), not the author, who is reacting to a difficult situation.

Given the lack of definitive evidence about the boyfriend's behavior and the friend's motives, the most morally responsible course would be open communication. However, the author’s contemplated actions, while not ideal, are a response to a situation created by others.

Therefore, the main fault lies with ""Other"" (the boyfriend if he is bragging and objectifying, or the friend if he is lying to cause trouble).

The exclusion is not based on any wrongdoing by the new member, but rather on group preference and convenience. The author recognizes the ability to solve the problem but opts not to act.

While the friend with the car enforces the exclusion, the author is complicit by not using their own resources to include the excluded person, despite being aware of the unfairness. The group as a whole is participating in the exclusion, and the new member is not at fault.

The author made a joke about Bob's finances, which Bob found hurtful, and the author apologized after realizing this. While Bob has made offensive jokes in the past, the author was the one who crossed a boundary that Bob later clarified. In contemporary norms, making jokes about sensitive topics like money—especially when someone may be struggling financially—is generally considered more problematic than other forms of ribbing, even if the group is otherwise irreverent. The author also acknowledges that the joke may have been inappropriate after learning more about Bob's feelings.

Therefore, the author bears primary responsibility for the awkwardness, even if unintentionally, because they made a joke about a sensitive topic that caused offense. The fact that Bob has made offensive jokes in the past does not justify making a joke that targets a potentially sensitive area for him.

The author has attempted to communicate their boundaries (e.g., saying they don't want to talk), and the coworker responds with behavior that the author finds distressing. There is no indication that the author has acted in a way that is intentionally harmful or disrespectful; rather, they are navigating a difficult social situation.

The coworker's behavior, while possibly influenced by neurodivergence, is making the author uncomfortable and disregards the author's stated boundaries. However, without more information about the workplace context, the coworker's understanding of social cues, or any attempts at mediation, it is difficult to assign full moral fault to either party. Still, based on ordinary contemporary norms, respecting others' boundaries is generally expected, regardless of neurodivergence, though accommodations and understanding are also important.

**Reasoning:**  
Under ordinary contemporary norms, it is generally considered a violation of trust and privacy to demand access to a partner's private messages or social media accounts without clear evidence of wrongdoing. While feelings of insecurity and jealousy are understandable, acting on them by requesting to see private conversations is typically seen as overstepping boundaries and not respecting the other person's autonomy. The girlfriend's behavior—maintaining a friendship with an ex and expressing some emotional attachment—may be uncomfortable for the author, but she has not clearly violated any moral or relational norms based on the information provided.

Even if the author did not solicit the photo, and even if Xavier was also acting immaturely by sharing the photo in the first place, the author had a clear responsibility not to further distribute it. The fact that the author showed the photo to others at the bar, even if only for a short time and among close friends, constitutes a breach of the woman's privacy and trust, as well as Xavier's trust (since he asked the author not to share it).

While Xavier is also at fault for sharing the photo without the woman's consent, the author is directly responsible for the further breach. In contemporary moral reasoning, ""everyone else does it"" or ""it was just a quick thing"" does not absolve the author of responsibility for their own actions.

Furthermore, dismissing the sister’s feelings as “overreacting” compounds the issue by invalidating her emotional response, which is generally considered disrespectful in modern interpersonal ethics.

While the sister’s reaction may seem strong, it is within the range of normal emotional responses to feeling embarrassed or betrayed, especially regarding sensitive matters like romantic interests.

However, the responsibility for managing interactions between the dog and others—especially those who may not understand boundaries—falls on the dog's owner (the author) and the other adults present (such as the boyfriend or the cousin's guardians).

The author feels frustrated but did not intervene to protect the dog or set boundaries, which is important for both the dog's welfare and the cousin's safety. However, the cousin's guardians or other adults present also share responsibility for supervising and guiding the cousin's interactions with the dog, especially given the cousin's disability and the dog's special needs.

Contemporary moral norms generally value fairness and transparency in public or semi-public settings like a gym. If the manager is making exceptions for one person without a clear, communicated policy, this can reasonably be seen as favoritism or unfair treatment. The author’s feelings of upset are understandable and not morally blameworthy in themselves. The manager, on the other hand, may be at fault for not applying rules consistently or for not communicating the rationale transparently to all members.

Therefore, the person at fault according to ordinary contemporary norms is the manager (i.e., ""Other"").

The author has not acted out in a harmful way, but rather is questioning whether their feelings of annoyance are morally wrong.

Under ordinary contemporary norms, it is not morally wrong to have feelings of annoyance or discomfort, especially when one's own experiences are consistently minimized or overshadowed in conversation. The author has generally been supportive and only recently showed visible annoyance. The friend, while clearly suffering and deserving of compassion, is engaging in behavior that can be emotionally taxing for those around her, but this is likely a result of her trauma rather than malicious intent.

Therefore, based on the scenario, **nobody is morally at fault** for simply feeling annoyed or for expressing trauma in conversation, given the context and the absence of malicious intent or harmful action.

While keeping promises is generally a moral good, the context matters: the pact was made under stress and fear, not as a rational, long-term commitment. It is also not reasonable to expect someone to sacrifice a major life opportunity (admission to a dream school) for the sake of a promise made in a moment of shared anxiety. The author did not intend to hurt their friend, and their excitement is a natural response to a significant achievement. The friend's feelings of betrayal are understandable, but it is not fair to demand the author give up their future for the sake of the pact. 

Therefore, under ordinary contemporary norms, the author is not morally at fault for breaking this promise, though it would be good for them to show empathy and support for their friend.

The husband did make an effort to get the correct order, and the receipt supports his claim that he ordered correctly, suggesting the restaurant made the error. However, when the mistake was discovered, the husband refused to go back to correct it, even though the author feels she would have done so for him. The escalation into an argument involved both parties.

From a moral reasoning perspective, both parties contributed to the escalation: the husband could have shown more care by correcting the mistake, and the author could have responded with more understanding given the circumstances. The initial error was not the husband's fault, but the handling of the aftermath involved both parties.

The husband has unilaterally changed this arrangement by giving the author significantly less of his paycheck, while still expecting her to pay all the bills and manage household expenses. He does not use his retained income to pay any bills, and becomes upset when bills are unpaid or accounts are overdrawn.

Under ordinary contemporary norms of fairness, shared responsibility, and communication in a partnership—especially where one partner is a stay-at-home parent and the other is the sole earner—the expectation is that both partners contribute equitably to the household, whether through labor or finances. The husband's actions undermine this shared responsibility and create unnecessary financial stress for the author, despite her fulfilling her agreed-upon role.

Therefore, the husband is at fault for unilaterally changing the arrangement and failing to ensure household needs are met, while still expecting the author to manage all financial obligations without adequate resources.

The author responded to the girlfriend's difficulty by acting angrily, grabbing the keys, and accidentally bumping her with his shoulder. While the bump was not intentional, the overall behavior (anger, lack of patience, physical contact, and slamming the door) was disrespectful and dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction—being upset and choosing not to ride with the author—was a response to feeling hurt and disrespected.

Under ordinary contemporary moral norms, it is generally expected that people treat their partners with patience and respect, even when frustrated. While the girlfriend's forgetfulness may be mildly annoying, it does not justify the author's angry and physically dismissive response. The girlfriend's reaction (screaming) is not ideal, but it is a response to being hurt.

Under ordinary contemporary moral norms, it is generally considered unacceptable to repeatedly create drama that negatively affects others, to be manipulative, and to dismiss legitimate concerns about safety and comfort.

The author is primarily motivated by comfort and a sense of ownership, but is not acting maliciously or unfairly, and there is no indication of any prior agreement being violated.

Under ordinary contemporary norms, it is generally considered reasonable for individuals to use the furniture they personally own, especially in shared living situations where no explicit agreements have been made. The author's reluctance to give up their solo bed is understandable and not morally blameworthy.

- The author was sitting at the head of the table for a while, with no pre-established seating arrangement.
- The father's request to sit at the head of the table was not accompanied by a clear or compelling reason, and when pressed, he escalated the situation by threatening anger rather than providing justification.
- The author responded politely at first, but then refused to move, which could be seen as stubborn but not unreasonable given the lack of explanation.
- The father, as the adult and parent, arguably had a greater responsibility to de-escalate and model respectful communication.
- The situation only resolved when the author, under family pressure, moved, while the father left the room in anger.

Under ordinary contemporary norms, the person who escalates a minor issue (seating) into a conflict, especially when they have more power in the relationship and do not provide a clear reason, is generally seen as more at fault. The author's initial refusal was not ideal, but the father's insistence and threat of anger over a trivial matter is a greater breach of reasonable adult behavior.

However, once living together, the roommate found the messiness more bothersome than anticipated and communicated her discomfort. The author and her boyfriend responded by improving their habits and keeping the mess to a minimum, but the roommate continued to express dissatisfaction and clean up after them, sometimes in a passive-aggressive manner.

Under ordinary contemporary norms, it is generally expected that roommates communicate openly and respectfully about shared spaces and that all parties make reasonable efforts to accommodate each other's comfort. The author and her boyfriend made a good-faith effort to adjust their behavior after the roommate's request, and the roommate's continued dissatisfaction seems to stem from a mismatch in expectations, despite the initial agreement.

The author retaliated by cutting up the girl's cardboard box, which is also a violation of respect for property, even if the author later attempted to repair it. Both parties engaged in behavior that was inconsiderate and disrespectful to each other's belongings.

Under ordinary contemporary norms, both taking someone's food without permission (especially after being told it was for someone else) and damaging someone else's property in retaliation are considered morally unacceptable. The fact that the author attempted to fix the box does not fully negate the initial act of cutting it up.

The friend did not technically betray any formal commitment, but he did lead the author on with clear romantic intentions and then abruptly withdrew without explanation, which is generally considered inconsiderate and emotionally insensitive. The author’s decision to distance herself is a reasonable response to feeling hurt and misled, and she is not morally obligated to maintain a friendship or provide an explanation, especially after being treated in a way that caused her emotional pain.

The author is contemplating whether to suggest abortion or vasectomy to their brother, who, along with his wife, is knowingly risking having another child with Tay-Sachs disease due to their religious opposition to contraception and abortion.

Key ethical considerations:
- Reproductive choices are generally considered a deeply personal matter, especially when influenced by religious beliefs.
- It is not inherently morally wrong to express concern or offer advice out of compassion, but pressuring or insisting on abortion or sterilization would be widely seen as overstepping personal boundaries.
- The brother and his wife are making a choice that carries foreseeable risks, but they are doing so in accordance with their sincerely held beliefs.
- The author is not at fault for feeling concern or even for considering raising the issue, as long as it is done respectfully and without coercion.

While you both laughed about the idea and you suggested posting it, your friend indicated he would do it later. By posting it yourself, you disregarded his expressed intention, which can be seen as taking credit for his creative contribution.

During our relationship when we got mad at each oth...",Everybody,Other,0.95,0.8571428571428571,True,"Based on contemporary moral norms, the main ethical issues in this scenario are:

1. The ex-girlfriend's behavior during and after the relationship, including dating others to provoke jealousy, quickly moving on to the author's friends, and engaging in sexualized interactions with them.
2. The friends' participation in romantic or sexual interactions with the author's ex-girlfriend soon after the breakup.
3. The author's feelings and judgments, particularly the use of derogatory language (""slut"") to describe the ex-girlfriend.

**Moral Evaluation:**
- The ex-girlfriend's actions (dating others to provoke jealousy, quickly moving on to the author's friends, and sexualized behavior) are generally considered inconsiderate and disrespectful, especially given the recent breakup and the involvement of the author's friends.
- The friends' participation, especially so soon after the breakup, is also generally seen as a breach of loyalty and sensitivity.
- The author is not at fault for feeling hurt or thinking the behavior is ""too much""—these are normal emotional reactions. However, using derogatory language (""slut"") is morally problematic, as it is a form of slut-shaming and perpetuates harmful stereotypes.

**Conclusion:**  
While the author’s emotional response is understandable, the use of derogatory language is not morally acceptable. However, the primary fault for inconsiderate and hurtful behavior lies with the ex-girlfriend and the friends, not the author.

Under contemporary moral norms, this is generally considered dishonest and unethical for several reasons:

1. **Deception**: The author would be intentionally deceiving train staff and other passengers by misrepresenting their dog's status.
2. **Undermining Trust**: Such actions can erode trust in legitimate service animals and their handlers, potentially making life more difficult for people with disabilities who rely on these animals.
3. **Unfair Advantage**: The author would be gaining access to privileges intended for people with disabilities, which is widely regarded as unfair and disrespectful.

While the train policies may be restrictive, the primary moral fault lies with the author for planning to engage in deliberate deception for personal convenience.

It is not morally required for someone to perform a sexual act that makes them uncomfortable, even if their partner is comfortable with it or has done it for them. Open and honest communication about boundaries is encouraged and should not be met with guilt-tripping or emotional pressure. In this scenario, the author communicated their discomfort respectfully and did not shame their partner.

The author repeatedly pressures his girlfriend to share her food even after she says no, and justifies it with gender-based reasoning and the idea that couples ""should"" share. The girlfriend, meanwhile, expresses her discomfort and feels the arrangement is unfair, especially since she cannot reciprocate due to dietary restrictions.

Respecting a partner's boundaries is a fundamental aspect of a healthy relationship. Persistently pushing someone to share something they do not want to share, especially after they have said no, is generally considered disrespectful. The justification that ""guys need more food"" is not a sufficient moral reason to override her wishes, nor is the idea that sharing is obligatory in relationships.

Therefore, under ordinary contemporary norms, the author is at fault for not respecting his girlfriend's boundaries and for rationalizing behavior that makes her uncomfortable.

The boyfriend did not harm the author's dog, nor did he express any intent to do so. The author is not morally obligated to continue a relationship with someone whose past actions she finds deeply upsetting, even if those actions are not considered immoral by all. Choosing to end a relationship over a value difference is within her rights and not a moral failing.

Therefore, in terms of fault, neither party has committed a clear moral wrong by contemporary standards: the boyfriend tried dog meat in a different culture out of curiosity, and the author is considering ending the relationship due to her strong feelings about dogs.

The author expresses jealousy and resentment upon seeing her ex with someone else, despite having told him she only sees him as a friend and having ended the relationship herself. While these feelings are understandable given the emotional turmoil and recent trauma, the author’s negative reaction to her ex moving on is not morally justified if she has made it clear she does not want a romantic relationship.

The ex-boyfriend, based on the information given, does not appear to have acted immorally in moving on after being told the relationship was over and that the author only saw him as a friend. The other people involved (parents, brother) may have acted harshly, but the question is focused on the author’s feelings and actions regarding her ex.

It is morally acceptable—and often necessary—for people to set boundaries to protect their own health, particularly when they are at risk of relapse or harm.

There is no evidence of moral wrongdoing by the author in choosing to step back for self-care. In fact, self-preservation in such circumstances is considered responsible.

- The boyfriend objects, claiming the heels are not a legitimate work expense, and compares it to buying expensive sneakers.

Moral reasoning:
- Both parties have used the joint account for work-related expenses, but there is a lack of clear, mutually agreed-upon guidelines for what qualifies as a ""work expense.""
- The author should have discussed the purchase beforehand, given the amount and the boyfriend's role in managing the account.

Child support is intended to provide for the needs of the shared child, not to support the entire family or children from other relationships. While it is reasonable to adjust child support as the paying parent's income increases, it is not morally obligatory for him to support the author's other children or household.

The author would be at fault if she is seeking increased support specifically to subsidize her whole family, rather than to meet the needs of their shared child. The ex-boyfriend's previous lectures, while perhaps unwelcome, do not constitute a moral failing in this context.

- The author, an adult (25), made sexual and BDSM jokes to a 16-year-old, which is widely considered inappropriate regardless of the context or the minor's perceived maturity. Even if the jokes were not graphic, the age difference and the nature of the jokes cross a boundary of acceptable behavior, especially in mixed-age online communities.
- The 16-year-old expressed discomfort (""he said no"" and ""he wasn't into that""), which should have been a clear signal to stop, regardless of whether he explicitly asked for the jokes to stop.
- The 16-year-old's subsequent actions (contacting the author's fiancé, taunting, and talking about the author) are immature and unkind, but are not as ethically significant as the initial boundary violation by the adult.
- The author's response—insulting the minor and making disparaging comments about his future—was also inappropriate and escalated the situation.

While the 16-year-old's behavior was not ideal, the primary moral responsibility lies with the adult for making inappropriate jokes to a minor and for responding harshly. The power and maturity imbalance places a greater ethical burden on the adult to act responsibly.

While the author is being somewhat controlling by saying she ""won't allow"" her sister to continue the relationship unless she meets the man, her motivation is rooted in concern for her sister's safety and well-being, especially given the significant age gap and her sister's inexperience. 

However, the sister is legally an adult and has the right to make her own choices, even if others view them as unwise. The author's approach could be seen as overstepping boundaries, but it is not malicious or self-serving; it is protective. The primary moral concern lies with the older man, whose decision to pursue a relationship with a much younger, inexperienced woman raises significant ethical red flags under contemporary norms.

Therefore, the person most at fault in this scenario, according to ordinary contemporary moral standards, is the older man, not the author.

The author has reasonable concerns about the brother's track record with electronics and has set a clear boundary regarding the use of their personal property. The brother's argument about sharing is not equivalent, as the author only used the brother's headphones with explicit permission, and is willing to stop if asked.

Under ordinary contemporary moral norms, individuals are generally not obligated to share personal property purchased with their own money, especially when there is a reasonable concern about potential damage and a history of carelessness by the other party. The parents' insistence that the author share the controller does not override the author's moral right to set boundaries regarding their own possessions.

While the abuser is clearly at fault for the original abuse, the ethical question here is about the author's current actions. The author is knowingly pursuing a romantic relationship with someone who abused their close friend, while also actively concealing this from the victim to avoid causing her distress. This secrecy undermines the trust the victim has in the author and prioritizes the author's desires over the well-being and emotional safety of the abused friend. Even if the abuser has changed, the author’s willingness to hide the relationship and risk retraumatizing the victim (should she find out) is morally questionable under contemporary norms of loyalty, honesty, and care for those who have been harmed.

The author was unaware of her relationship status at the time and only learned about her boyfriend after the fact. Under ordinary contemporary moral norms, responsibility for infidelity typically lies with the person who is in the committed relationship, unless the third party is knowingly complicit. Since the author did not know she had a boyfriend, he is not morally at fault for the initial encounter. 

However, after the first encounter, the author became aware of her boyfriend, but the scenario does not specify whether the second encounter happened before or after she broke up with her boyfriend. If the second encounter happened before the breakup, both would share some responsibility; if after, then only she would be at fault for the initial infidelity.

Given the information, the primary fault lies with the ex-girlfriend (the ""other"" in this scenario).

The author dressed in a way that was consistent with the party theme (dark/leather), and his choice to wear a white undershirt instead of a black t-shirt was motivated by comfort due to the heat, not by a desire to attract attention or make his girlfriend uncomfortable. When he realized his girlfriend was upset, he apologized, explained his reasoning, and even offered to go home and change. His girlfriend, however, responded with hostility and left the party, despite his attempts to resolve the situation.

Contemporary norms generally hold that people are responsible for communicating their feelings and concerns, and that unintentional actions that cause discomfort—especially when followed by a sincere apology and an offer to remedy the situation—do not typically make someone morally at fault. The girlfriend's reaction, while understandable from an emotional perspective, was disproportionate given the circumstances and the author's efforts to make amends.

Therefore, under ordinary contemporary norms, the author is not at fault.

While some people do cope with grief through humor, it is generally expected to be mindful of the audience and the context, especially when others are visibly affected. The author's response (""Wow, kind of harsh, but okay."") was a mild, non-confrontational way to express discomfort and uphold a respectful tone, which is generally seen as appropriate in such situations. The author did not escalate the situation or attack the other person, but simply acknowledged the inappropriateness of the comment.

The author, after being wronged, chose to sleep with the ex's close friend, arguably as an act of revenge. While this action could be seen as morally questionable (especially if it was done primarily to hurt the ex), the initial and more significant moral breaches were committed by the ex-boyfriend. The friend (HF) also bears some responsibility for betraying his friend, but the author’s actions are a response to prior mistreatment.

Given the context, the most morally blameworthy party is the ex-boyfriend, but the author and HF also engaged in behavior that could be considered ethically dubious. Therefore, the most accurate classification is that everyone involved bears some fault.

The girlfriend, on the other hand, is embarrassed and upset by the repeated comments, but does not appear to be acting maliciously.

From an ethical standpoint, both parties could have handled the situation better: the author could have communicated more directly and compassionately, and the girlfriend could have been more receptive to feedback about hygiene, which is a reasonable concern in a relationship. The escalation of the argument and mutual misunderstanding suggest shared responsibility for the conflict.

The teacher is described as strict, possibly abrasive, and may have made some unfair accusations, but there is no evidence of serious misconduct or abuse.

While the teacher's behavior may be unpleasant and arguably unprofessional at times, the act of creating a meme page to mock or ridicule a specific teacher—especially in a way that could be seen by many students—crosses a line into targeted public shaming or cyberbullying. Even if the intent is humor, this can contribute to a hostile environment for the teacher and is generally considered morally wrong under contemporary norms, especially given the power imbalance and the teacher's personal circumstances.

Therefore, the primary moral fault lies with the author for creating and maintaining the meme page, despite the teacher's behavior.

However, it is also customary for the person doing the favor to communicate their arrival time, especially if it is not prearranged. In this scenario, the cousin did not specify when he would arrive, and the author did not make an effort to check who was at the door or respond to calls, prioritizing a video game over a real-life commitment.

While both parties could have communicated better, the author bears more responsibility for ignoring multiple calls and the doorbell, knowing that the cousin was likely to come by at some point. The cousin's reaction (posting on social media and deleting the author) may be excessive, but the initial fault lies with the author for not being reasonably attentive.

While it is normal to have feelings of discomfort or insecurity, the way those feelings are expressed matters morally.

Under ordinary contemporary norms, expressing interest in a partner's culture is not inherently wrong, but pressuring someone to perform cultural labor or fulfill cultural expectations—especially after they have expressed discomfort or inability—can be insensitive. However, the interaction described here does not rise to the level of clear moral fault; it seems more like a minor misunderstanding or difference in expectations.

- The author engaged in physical contact that her partner found uncomfortable and triggering, but stopped immediately when asked and apologized sincerely multiple times.
- The partner is entitled to her feelings and reactions, especially given her trauma history, and may need time to process.
- The author is questioning whether her partner's ongoing reaction is proportionate or if it is being used to reinforce an unequal dynamic in the relationship.
- The author is not dismissing her partner's feelings, nor is she refusing accountability for the initial action.
- There is no evidence of malicious intent or refusal to respect boundaries on the author's part.
- The partner's ongoing distress is understandable, but the author is also entitled to her own emotional boundaries and to question the health of the relationship dynamic.

Given these facts, under ordinary contemporary norms, neither party is clearly at fault for the situation as described. The author respected boundaries once they were communicated, apologized, and attempted to support her partner. The partner is allowed to process her feelings in her own way. The author's internal questioning is not, in itself, morally blameworthy.

- The author has been transparent with Joey about their feelings and Monica's likely feelings, and has encouraged Joey to communicate directly with Monica.
- Monica has been somewhat passive and arguably stringing Joey along, but is waiting for him to initiate a conversation to clarify things.
- Joey is in denial and has not taken steps to clarify the relationship, despite being given ample opportunity and encouragement.
- The author has delayed pursuing Monica out of consideration for Joey's feelings, but is now feeling that this has gone on long enough.

Under ordinary contemporary norms, it is not considered morally wrong to pursue a romantic interest, even if a friend has feelings for that person, provided that one is honest and transparent, and does not intentionally deceive or betray the friend. The author has acted with transparency and patience, and has given Joey every reasonable opportunity to address the situation himself.

The main fault here lies with Joey, for refusing to confront the reality of the situation and communicate directly with Monica, and to a lesser extent with Monica, for not being more direct with Joey. The author is not at fault for wanting to move forward.

While the other person (IR) also used a racist insult, the author’s use of the n-word is especially egregious and is the direct cause of the disciplinary action. The author acknowledges this was wrong. While IR is also at fault for their own racist comment, the question is about who is at fault in the context of the disciplinary situation described.

Given the focus on the author’s comment and the resulting consequences, and the fact that the author’s action is the subject of the school’s response, the most appropriate answer is:

The father's repeated use of physical force (even if described as ""occasional slaps"" in the past) and the escalation to grabbing the throat is a clear violation of acceptable behavior.

The author’s disrespectful language is not ideal, but it does not rise to the level of moral fault that would justify or balance out the father's actions. Therefore, the primary moral fault lies with the father.

The friend’s behavior—seeking attention through indirect communication and projecting a bad attitude—can be emotionally taxing and is not an ideal way to seek support. However, ""ghosting"" (cutting off communication without explanation) is generally considered an inconsiderate way to end or pause a friendship, especially when the other person is not being overtly abusive or harmful.

A more morally acceptable approach would be to communicate boundaries directly and honestly, rather than disappearing without explanation. While the friend’s behavior is frustrating, the author’s contemplated response (ghosting) is not justified by the situation as described.

Therefore, the author would be considered at fault for planning to ghost the friend rather than addressing the issue directly.

While this may be inconsiderate or self-serving, it does not rise to the level of clear moral wrongdoing by the author. The friend is primarily at fault for not being transparent and for prioritizing her new relationship over her prior commitment to the author, while also asking the author to take on a legal/financial risk for her benefit.

The father's reaction—using harsh language, guilt, and threats—crosses the line from expressing concern to being emotionally manipulative.

The author is not at fault for pursuing a path that aligns with her own values and happiness, especially after careful reflection and in the context of her recovery. The father's behavior is morally problematic due to his lack of respect for her autonomy and his use of emotional pressure.

The MIL and FIL repeatedly violated these boundaries, lied or misled the parents, and prioritized their own desires or BIL's needs over the child's safety and the parents' wishes. The husband's lack of support and understanding of the seriousness of the situation is also a contributing factor, but the primary fault lies with the in-laws for disregarding explicit parental instructions and trust.

The author’s actions are motivated by concern for their child’s well-being, and their decision to restrict unsupervised access is justified given the repeated breaches of trust and the potential risks involved. While the author acknowledges some personal bias, the core issue is the repeated violation of clear, reasonable boundaries.

The dad's girlfriend's response, while perhaps harsh, is defending the sister's right to choose her own clothing and pushing back against what she perceives as body shaming or sexism.

However, the author did not appear to insult or shame the sister directly, but rather expressed a personal discomfort and opinion about age-appropriateness. The dad's girlfriend's reaction, while possibly overreacting, is not morally blameworthy in itself, as she is defending the sister.

Given the information, neither party's actions rise to the level of clear moral fault under ordinary norms—this is a common family disagreement about modesty and autonomy, and both sides are expressing their views. There is no clear wrongdoing.

The author did not consult the person who placed the order before cancelling it.

Under ordinary contemporary moral norms, unilaterally cancelling someone else's purchase—especially without their knowledge or consent—would generally be considered morally unacceptable, unless there are extenuating circumstances (e.g., clear evidence of fraud, financial harm, or a prior agreement about such actions). The default assumption is that the person who placed the order had a reason for doing so, and interfering with their decision without discussion is disrespectful of their autonomy.

Therefore, the author is at fault.

The author is not claiming exclusive rights to the park, but is considering making a polite request.

Under ordinary contemporary norms, public dog parks are shared spaces, and no one has an exclusive right to them unless otherwise posted. However, it is not inherently rude or morally wrong to politely ask someone to use a different area, especially if there are multiple sections and the request is made out of concern for a traumatized dog. The other party is not obligated to comply, but the act of asking is not itself a moral fault.

The author’s decision to limit contact between their (future) child and unvaccinated relatives until the child is fully vaccinated is a reasonable measure, especially given the vulnerability of infants before completing their vaccination schedule. 

The fault, according to prevailing ethical standards, lies with those who refuse to vaccinate their children based on misinformation, thereby increasing the risk of preventable disease transmission to others, including infants and immunocompromised individuals. The author’s parents’ argument that vaccination of their own child is sufficient does not fully account for the period before the child is fully immunized, nor for the risk to others in the community.

Therefore, the author is not at fault for their stance; the fault lies with the relatives who refuse vaccination for their children.

The house is not solely the author's; it is a family asset, and the mother has allowed all siblings to live there under similar terms. The author’s desire to maintain a ""bachelor pad"" atmosphere is understandable, but it does not override the equal claim the twin sister has to the house, especially since the arrangement was set up by the mother for all siblings. The author is considering excluding the twin sister primarily for personal comfort and aesthetic reasons, not for any serious or safety-related concerns.

While it is reasonable to want to avoid conflict and maintain a preferred living environment, it would be morally wrong to unilaterally deny the twin sister access to the house that is equally hers to use, especially when she has expressed excitement and has no other comparable options (her only alternative is to live with their mother, which is less independent and may not be her preference). The author’s feelings are valid, but the action of excluding the sister would be unfair.
