Both parties contributed to the uncomfortable exchange. The author made a comment about her friend's eating habits, which, even if intended as light-hearted, can be sensitive and come off as judgmental. The friend responded by making critical remarks about the author's eating, implying she was a glutton and that eating three meals a day is ""gross,"" which is also rude and judgmental. The author then escalated by making a pointed comment about their relative sizes, which is a sensitive topic and likely to hurt feelings.

The author is not at fault for being concerned about the safety and well-being of their family, especially given the serious criminal and drug-related issues surrounding the wife's friend and her ex. The author is still offering significant help (paying rent), just not in a way that could endanger their own household. The wife is not necessarily at fault either—her desire to help is compassionate and well-intentioned, even if perhaps not fully considering the risks.

Final Answer: Everybody

Explanation:  
Both parties share some responsibility here. The author used the joint account for a personal purchase (heels), which, while arguably for work, is a gray area—especially since the boyfriend disagrees on what counts as a ""work expense."" The boyfriend, meanwhile, spends a significant amount on weed and considers it a work expense, which is also debatable. Both have different standards for what is acceptable to use joint funds for, and neither has clearly communicated or agreed on these standards. The argument stems from a lack of clear boundaries and communication about joint account usage, so both are at fault for not establishing or respecting mutual guidelines.",stop,1211,140,1351

Explanation: The author would be at fault for asking her ex to pay more child support specifically to support her whole family, not just their shared child. Child support is intended for the needs of the child both parents share, not to subsidize the author's other children or household expenses unrelated to that child. While it is reasonable to adjust child support based on the father's increased income, the motivation described is to support the entire family, which is not appropriate.",stop,838,102,940

The author is not at fault here. They set reasonable boundaries after being subjected to manipulative and emotionally abusive behavior, including threats of self-harm and dishonesty. The ex-partner's actions—lying about cheating, threatening self-harm to control the author, and later revealing a different story—are the primary source of harm and confusion.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
The author is at fault here, primarily for the way they are framing and questioning their partner's reaction to being triggered by an unwanted sexual advance. While the author did stop when asked and apologized, their subsequent frustration and suspicion that their partner might be ""using"" the incident to manipulate the relationship dynamic is problematic. It is not appropriate to question or doubt someone's reaction to a sexual trigger, especially given both partners' histories of assault. The author’s internal narrative about ""coddling"" and resentment about the relationship dynamic is understandable as a feeling, but the act of questioning the legitimacy of their partner's emotional response crosses a line. The author is not at fault for the initial incident (since they stopped and apologized), but is at fault for the way they are now framing and doubting their partner’s reaction.",stop,2006,177,2183

Explanation:  
This is a complex family situation involving addiction, mental health, and trust. The author is making decisions based on the safety and well-being of their child, which is a reasonable and responsible priority. The MIL and FIL have repeatedly disregarded clear boundaries, but their actions are influenced by complicated family dynamics and mental health struggles. The husband is caught between his wife and his parents, and while communication could be better, there is no clear malice or gross negligence. Everyone is acting from their own perspective and limitations, but nobody is acting with clear, intentional harm.

Explanation:  
This is a difficult and emotional situation, but nobody is clearly ""at fault."" The author is understandably hurt by the way the company director handled the rejection, which does sound insensitive and unnecessarily harsh. However, the boyfriend is not at fault for not intervening, as it could jeopardize his own job and professional boundaries. The company director could have been more tactful, but ultimately has the right to hire who he wants, even if his reasoning is questionable. The author's decision to distance herself from her boyfriend's work is a personal boundary, not a moral failing. No one here is acting with clear malice or wrongdoing—it's a tough, disappointing situation with hurt feelings, but not one where anyone is definitively ""at fault.""",stop,1149,162,1311

- The author is at fault for participating in making a video that pokes fun at teachers and school staff, even if they didn't want a specific scene included. They were still involved in the project and shared responsibility for its content.
- The teacher is at fault for making an extremely inappropriate and insensitive comment about the author's grandmother being in the hospital, which is unprofessional and hurtful.
- The substitute is at fault for giving incorrect instructions, which contributed to the confusion about the assignment due dates.
- The friend is at fault for pushing for the inclusion of the specific scene and not taking responsibility when the teacher was upset.

The author (security guard) is performing their job according to the rules of the mall, enforcing policies about sleeping, causing disturbances, and closing time.

The team leader is following a more lenient policy, possibly out of compassion or company policy, but is not directly at fault for the incident itself. The author did not use excessive force or act out of malice, and the regular, while difficult, is struggling with addiction and homelessness.

Explanation:  
The author is not at fault for seeking a legal resolution after repeated unsuccessful attempts to negotiate reasonable visitation. Filing for a custody hearing is a standard and appropriate step when one parent is being denied access without clear justification. The mother’s fears, while understandable, are not based on any evidence of neglect or harm, and the author has tried to address her concerns. The situation is difficult, but neither party is acting maliciously; both are acting out of concern for the child. Thus, nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a moral sense—they are just in conflict over what is best for their child.",stop,968,135,1103

Explanation:  
You were not at fault for sitting down when a seat became available, especially after waiting to see if anyone else wanted it. There were no elderly or visibly disabled people near you who needed the seat, and you were willing to give it up if someone asked. The old lady's frustration seems more about general annoyance than a specific need. In crowded public transport, it's reasonable to expect people to ask for a seat if they need it, and you were not ignoring anyone in need. Therefore, nobody is truly at fault in this situation.",stop,997,122,1119

Explanation: The author is at fault for telling her son that if he sells the valuable heirloom, he should give half to his sister. While the distribution of the items may have been uneven in monetary value, the grandmother gave the gifts as she saw fit, likely based on tradition and sentiment, not financial worth. The author is imposing her own sense of fairness after the fact, which undermines both the grandmother's intentions and her son's autonomy over his gift. The son is not obligated to share the proceeds, and the daughter is not entitled to a share simply because her gift was less valuable. The author is overstepping by dictating what her son should do with his inheritance.",stop,846,149,995

Explanation: The main wrongdoing in this scenario is the author's decision to lie about having a one night stand out of anger and spite. While the American girl's actions (ending things with her boyfriend, then trying to get back with him, then returning to the author) are emotionally complicated, she did not lie to the author about her actions. The author, however, intentionally lied to hurt her, which is a clear fault. The American girl's later admission of sleeping with someone was not done as a direct response to the author's (false) claim, since she did not know it was a lie at the time. The core issue is the author's dishonesty and intent to hurt.",stop,856,146,1002

Based on the scenario, the author and their sibling were essentially excluded from their ex-stepdad's life after he remarried, despite having grown up with him as a father figure. The ex-stepdad was the one who distanced himself and only reached out sporadically, seemingly for his own convenience.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
The author is at fault for not paying rent on time and for not addressing the issue of the girlfriend moving in when it first became a concern. While it is understandable to feel uncomfortable about paying for someone else's share, the author never brought up the issue or negotiated a new arrangement. The roommate was accommodating about late payments, and the author agreed to pay back what was owed. The fact that the girlfriend lived there rent-free should have been discussed at the time, not used retroactively as a reason to avoid paying back the agreed-upon debt. Therefore, the author is at fault for both the late payments and for not communicating concerns earlier.",stop,877,143,1020

Reasoning:  
You (the author) are not at fault for setting a boundary about not wanting to be friends with someone who maintains a relationship with your abuser. You have communicated your feelings and needs clearly and are not demanding that your friend end her friendship—just that you cannot continue your own friendship under these circumstances. Your friend (M) is also not strictly at fault for choosing her own friends, even if her choice is hurtful to you; she is allowed to make her own decisions, even if others disagree with them. While her justification may feel insensitive, she is not obligated to cut someone off at your request, and you are not obligated to remain friends with her.

- The author is justified in feeling frustrated about the unfair garage arrangement, especially since all roommates pay equal rent and the couple never paid extra for the garage spots.
- However, the author is also at fault for holding the garage door opener ""as collateral"" and not returning it when asked, which is petty and escalates the conflict.
- The couple (S & K) are at fault for monopolizing both garage spots for years without offering to share or discussing a fair arrangement, especially after misleading the author about paying extra.

Final Answer: Other

Explanation:  
The author and her husband acted reasonably throughout: resetting an iPad before gifting it to a child is standard, and they made efforts to send gifts and money, even when things went wrong (e.g., lost mail). The brother-in-law and his wife, on the other hand, responded with disproportionate anger, rudeness, and unreasonable demands, including yelling, leaving aggressive messages, and blaming the author and her husband for minor issues. The pattern of behavior from the brother-in-law and his wife (and even the fact that another godparent cut contact) suggests the fault lies with them, not the author or her husband.",stop,1416,142,1558

Explanation: The author would be at fault because the girlfriend has explicitly stated her dream is to shop for her own engagement ring.

Explanation:  
While the author was harsh with their sister-in-law (SIL), the context is important: the SIL was being emotionally abusive toward her son, especially regarding his sexuality, and the author intervened to protect him. The author did not yell or use physical aggression, but spoke harsh truths in a direct manner. The SIL's past actions (abuse, neglect, ongoing emotional harm) are significant, and the author was acting out of a protective instinct for their nephew, who has already suffered greatly.

The author expresses genuine guilt and empathy, and their actions were supported by their nephew and not condemned by other family members. While the SIL is struggling, her behavior at the dinner was harmful and needed to be addressed. The situation is complex, but given the circumstances, nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a moral sense—this was a difficult, emotionally charged moment with no easy answers.",stop,1388,193,1581

Explanation: The author is expressing frustration and concern about a dangerous and stressful situation involving their boyfriend's dog, but they have not actually made anyone choose yet—they are asking if it would be wrong to do so. The dog’s behavior is genuinely problematic and potentially unsafe, and the author has tried to make it work. The boyfriend is also not clearly at fault, as he is trying to handle his first dog and may not realize the severity. This is a difficult situation with no clear wrongdoing yet—just a need for honest communication and possibly professional help for the dog.",stop,864,125,989

Your friend is the one making repeated, unsolicited, and judgmental comments about your eating habits, which is inappropriate regardless of her own struggles. While her history with an eating disorder may explain her behavior, it does not excuse it, and you are not at fault for feeling uncomfortable or wanting to set boundaries. You have shown empathy and patience, and your desire to avoid eating with her is a reasonable response to protect your own well-being.",stop,1111,99,1210

Explanation:  
The author is describing a series of frustrating but common public situations (a child coughing, people being inconsiderate in crowds, a kid needing to pee on a plane) and their own emotional reaction to them. The author does not act out or mistreat anyone; they simply feel annoyed and sometimes give a reflexive dirty look. Their frustration is understandable, and they are self-aware enough to question if their reactions are fair. The other people involved (children, parents, crowds) are behaving in ways that are inconsiderate but not malicious or egregiously wrong for public spaces. No one is truly ""at fault"" in a way that warrants blame—these are just the annoyances of public life. The author’s feelings are valid, and the other parties are not acting with clear malice. Thus, nobody is truly at fault.",stop,1854,184,2038

Explanation:  
While the relationship was clearly dysfunctional and both parties behaved poorly (her family was hostile, she was ungrateful, and she physically assaulted you), the specific question is about cheating. Regardless of the state of the relationship, you cheated on your girlfriend before officially breaking up. Cheating is a clear violation of trust and relationship boundaries, and is your responsibility. The relationship may have been ""dead,"" but you did not end it before sleeping with someone else. Therefore, you are at fault for the cheating.",stop,971,116,1087

Explanation: While it's understandable to feel uncomfortable about your father's girlfriend being your age, refusing to meet her or allow your dad to bring her to your wedding (especially if you are otherwise close to your dad) is unnecessarily exclusionary. Weddings are significant family events, and it's customary to allow close family members to bring their partners, regardless of how often you see them. Your personal discomfort doesn't outweigh your father's relationship or his desire to share important moments with his partner. Therefore, you are at fault here.",stop,767,112,879

While the mother’s communication is flawed and her behavior may be frustrating, the author’s resentment is primarily rooted in jealousy and expectations around gifts and money. The mother is not obligated to provide expensive gifts to her adult children, and her choice to help another family—however inconsistently communicated—does not make her at fault. The author’s feelings are understandable given their financial hardship, but the expectation and resentment toward the mother’s charitable actions, and the way the author confronted her, place the fault primarily with the author.",stop,1924,118,2042

Explanation:  
This situation is a classic example of friends engaging in mutual roasting, which is typically understood as playful banter among close friends. The author's friend regularly boasts about his intelligence, which can be annoying, but the author only responded in kind during a roast session. While the author's comment was pointed, it was in the context of mutual joking, and the friend's reaction (being offended) is understandable but not something that makes either party truly ""at fault."" Both parties participated in the banter, and the escalation was a result of mutual behavior. Therefore, nobody is truly at fault here.",stop,1089,131,1220

Explanation:  
The author should have communicated with his girlfriend ahead of time that he was hanging out with a female friend, especially given the history of jealousy and the fact that he had declined plans with his girlfriend for that day. This lack of communication can understandably make a partner feel hurt or suspicious. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction—sending repeated, berating messages and expressing jealousy in a way that seems excessive—was also inappropriate and unproductive.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
While the boyfriend's communication could be better, the author acknowledges that their behavior with the coworker has been flirty and ""a bit too close,"" and that there are ongoing jokes about them being together. Even if there was no cheating, the author has not maintained clear boundaries appropriate for someone in a relationship, especially given the physical affection (hugging), private lunches, and making special meals. The boyfriend's feelings, while perhaps not perfectly expressed, are not unreasonable given the context. Therefore, the author is primarily at fault for not respecting relationship boundaries.",stop,834,126,960

Final Answer: Nobody

This is a situation where boundaries and comfort levels clash, but no one is truly ""at fault"" in a moral sense. The author is within their rights to not want to kennel their dog in their own home, especially since the dog is not dangerous. The sister is advocating for her child's comfort, albeit in a confrontational way, but her reaction is likely influenced by stress and past patterns. The niece is a child with a fear that has been reinforced by the adults around her. The fiancé is trying to keep the peace. While the sister's yelling is inappropriate, the core issue is a difference in boundaries and expectations, not malice or clear wrongdoing.",stop,1163,144,1307

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
While the initial action (the friend tapping the woman on the shoulder) was arguably a social misstep but not necessarily malicious, the author escalated the situation by repeatedly challenging the woman's and the bartender's reactions, refusing to accept their boundaries, and continuing to argue after being asked to leave. The author’s insistence on debating the appropriateness of the touch, rather than accepting that it made someone uncomfortable and moving on, contributed to the discomfort and escalation. The bartender’s job is to maintain a comfortable environment for patrons, and the author’s refusal to drop the issue made things worse. Thus, the author is most at fault for prolonging and escalating the conflict.",stop,1046,148,1194

Explanation: The main conflict is that the roommate (A) got angry and confrontational about a dog being over, despite the house being described as very dog-friendly and the roommates themselves often inviting dogs over. The author and their partner were watching a friend's dog, and while they didn't explicitly inform A, it seems like this was not out of the ordinary for the household. A's reaction was abrupt and aggressive, especially since the author apologized and tried to explain. The author and their partner did not act maliciously or negligently, and the dog caused no problems.

Explanation:  
While the boyfriend's feelings are understandable, the author is the one who made a joking but hurtful comment about not introducing him to her parents until he has a job, knowing her parents' traditional views. This reinforced his insecurities and made him feel ashamed, even if that wasn't her intention. The author is prioritizing her parents' approval and cultural expectations over her boyfriend's feelings, and while cultural context matters, her approach lacked sensitivity to his perspective. The boyfriend's reaction is not unreasonable given the situation, and the author herself acknowledges that she could handle things more maturely. Therefore, the author is primarily at fault for how she handled the situation.",stop,1496,146,1642

She has the right to her own feelings and boundaries, and it's not her fault that she doesn't want a romantic relationship.

Explanation:  
Based on the scenario, there was a breakdown in communication and unmet expectations, but neither party did anything egregiously wrong or malicious. The author chose not to share details about their relationship due to past judgment and a desire for privacy, which is reasonable. The roommate felt hurt by the perceived distance and lack of communication, but instead of addressing it directly, she vented to others and became passive-aggressive. Both parties could have handled things better, but the situation is more about miscommunication and mismatched expectations than clear fault.

Regardless of intentions or contraceptive use, both parties are responsible for the potential consequences of sex, including pregnancy. Legally and morally, a parent cannot simply opt out of supporting their child because they do not want to be involved. The author’s desire for a ""financial abortion"" is not supported by law in most places, and refusing to acknowledge or support the child is irresponsible. The emotional distress is understandable, but the author is at fault for their stance and refusal to take responsibility.",stop,812,142,954

Explanation: The author shared a photo with someone who then shared it without permission, despite knowing the author's insecurities. The author responded by blocking her and cutting contact, which is a reasonable boundary after a breach of trust. The other person escalated the situation by ranting to friends and acting out at school. The main fault lies with the girl who shared the photo without consent.",stop,706,88,794

The primary fault in this situation lies with the mother, given her abusive behavior (yelling, physical threats, emotional manipulation) toward her children. While the author acknowledges some personal shortcomings (not helping enough around the house, being disorganized), these are typical teenage behaviors and do not justify the mother's actions. The father is also mentioned as being emotionally absent and not contributing to the household or parenting, which makes him partially at fault as well. However, the author is not at fault for the abuse or the dysfunctional family dynamics. Thus, ""Other"" (the mother and, to a lesser extent, the father) are at fault.",stop,1848,139,1987

Explanation: The author is expressing frustration about perceived double standards in their relationship, but is not acting maliciously or unfairly—just venting and seeking advice. The wife’s views may be frustrating or inconsistent, but the scenario describes a values mismatch rather than clear wrongdoing by either party.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
While the situation is difficult and emotionally taxing, the boyfriend is prioritizing his role as a father, especially given the limited time he gets with his children due to the contentious relationship with his ex. The author’s disappointment is understandable, but expecting her boyfriend to choose her over his child’s birthday (which happens to fall on Valentine’s Day) is unreasonable. The boyfriend’s frustration is also understandable, given the pressure he’s under. The author is at fault for making her boyfriend feel guilty about wanting to spend his child’s birthday with his child, even if it means missing out on a traditional Valentine’s Day experience.",stop,1087,138,1225

Final Answer: Author

Explanation: While the bullying and toxic work environment described are clearly the fault of the established staff and management (""Other""), the specific question is about whether the author is at fault for posting about it on Facebook. Even though the author was venting and deleted the post quickly, posting about workplace issues on social media—especially in a way that could be traced back to the workplace—can be considered unprofessional and risky, as it can escalate workplace conflict and potentially violate workplace policies. Therefore, in the context of the question ""AITA for posting that on Facebook,"" the author is at fault for that specific action, even if the broader situation is not their fault.",stop,1048,144,1192

Final Answer: Author

Explanation: The author is at fault for considering and planning to intentionally poison (or make someone sick with) spoiled food as revenge. While the roommate is clearly in the wrong for repeatedly stealing food, the author's proposed action is both unethical and potentially illegal (deliberately causing harm to another person). The correct course of action is to continue with the eviction and possibly involve authorities if theft continues, not to endanger someone's health.",stop,1155,97,1252

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
While the situation is complex and C's actions (hiding the pregnancy, being insistent about having a child) were problematic, the author is ultimately responsible for their ongoing choice to have no contact with their child. Regardless of the circumstances of conception or the relationship with C, the child (N) is innocent and deserves a relationship with their parent if possible. The author is paying child support, which is a legal obligation, but is choosing to have no emotional or personal involvement with their child, which is generally considered morally wrong by most societal standards. The author’s continued refusal to engage with their child, despite the child’s expressed feelings of abandonment, places the fault primarily on the author.",stop,1299,153,1452

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
The author is at fault if they choose to PM the 16-year-old despite the mother not responding to their previous, respectful request for permission. The mother’s lack of response can reasonably be interpreted as a “no” or at least a “not now.” The author recognizes that reaching out directly could cause issues and is aware of the potential for burning bridges or causing distress. While the author’s feelings and desire for connection are understandable, the respectful and ethical course is to wait until the sibling is an adult and can make their own decisions without parental involvement. Reaching out now would disregard the mother’s boundaries and the minor’s current family situation.",stop,1118,144,1262

Explanation: Both the author and their partner are at fault here. The author is refusing to consider rehoming the dog despite a potential health risk to their child and a significant change in family circumstances, which could be seen as prioritizing the pet over the child's well-being. The partner, on the other hand, appears to be pushing for rehoming the dog possibly as a matter of convenience rather than necessity, and communication between the two has broken down, leading to a heated argument where both said hurtful things.

You are not at fault for hesitating to let your dad and brother move in, especially on your husband’s birthday and given your husband’s health situation. You have valid concerns about your dad’s behavior, your brother’s girlfriend, and the financial responsibility of both. You are also considering reasonable boundaries and expectations if you do let them stay. The situation is difficult, but you are not being unreasonable or cruel. Your dad and brother are in a tough spot, but their predicament is largely due to their own actions and choices. You are not obligated to immediately accommodate them, especially without discussing it with your husband. No one is acting maliciously here; it’s just a tough family situation.",stop,877,153,1030

Both the author and the roommate contributed to the breakdown of the living situation. The author admits to being strict, having a ""tone problem,"" and setting rules that may have been difficult for the roommate and his girlfriend. The author also acknowledges sulking, not communicating directly, and eavesdropping. The roommate, on the other hand, became lax with chores, did not respect boundaries, and left abruptly without proper notice, causing financial and emotional strain. The girlfriend also contributed to the tension by confronting the author when they explicitly said they did not want to talk.

Explanation: The primary fault lies with the husband, who has a long-standing gambling addiction, has repeatedly lied, manipulated, and financially abused the author (including hacking her bank account and taking money without consent). While the author’s temper and yelling are not ideal, they are a reaction to ongoing, severe mistreatment and financial betrayal. The author’s request to see the bank account is reasonable under the circumstances, and the escalation to shouting is a response to repeated gaslighting and abuse. The root cause of the conflict and harm is the husband’s behavior.",stop,1665,122,1787

This is a situation where the author is reacting to years of feeling excluded, uncomfortable, and even mistreated by extended family. The author’s decision to unfriend and distance themselves is a personal boundary in response to hurtful behavior, not an act of malice or wrongdoing. The extended family’s behavior is unkind and exclusionary, but not overtly abusive in this scenario. There’s no clear “fault” in the sense of someone doing something objectively wrong—rather, it’s a case of incompatible personalities, unresolved family dynamics, and self-protection. Thus, nobody is strictly “at fault.”",stop,994,133,1127

This situation involves a parent (the dad) escalating a conflict with threats, shouting, and physical intimidation, which is inappropriate and harmful behavior toward a child.

Your roommate (the landlord's son) is at fault here.

Explanation: While the author is in a difficult situation and their desire for privacy is understandable, it is not generally considered reasonable to ask a tenant—especially one paying rent, even at a discount—to vacate their home for the convenience of the landlords, even temporarily. The friend is not just a guest; he is a paying lodger with rights to the space. The author’s request, even if made politely and with notice, oversteps typical landlord-tenant boundaries.

Explanation:  
The main source of conflict and rudeness in this scenario comes from your friend’s friend, who openly complained, made passive-aggressive and then directly offensive comments (“you white prick”), and continued to escalate the situation. Your friend also failed to mediate or support you, instead dismissing your feelings as “raging.” While you did withhold healing as a form of retaliation, this was a minor response to being treated poorly, and your actions (muting, leaving Discord) were reasonable boundaries in response to ongoing disrespect.

Explanation: While the author’s intentions are kind, their approach is patronizing and undermines their coworker’s sense of agency and merit. By explicitly telling their friend “you need it more than I do” and refusing to apply, the author frames the promotion as charity rather than a professional opportunity, which is understandably offensive. The author could have simply chosen not to apply without making it about their coworker’s needs or could have encouraged their friend to apply without making it about pity. The author’s actions, though well-meaning, are at fault for making their friend feel pitied rather than respected.",stop,927,133,1060

Explanation: The author recommended firing the CTO just before his vesting cliff, specifically to avoid giving him any equity, despite the CTO having worked for 10 months and contributed to the company. While the vesting cliff is a standard mechanism, intentionally timing the firing to deny someone the agreed-upon compensation for their work is generally considered unethical, especially if the CTO was performing his duties and there were no major issues with his work.

Explanation:  
There are multiple people at fault in this situation. The author is at fault for sending a cruel, personal message to the other woman, which was inappropriate and hurtful, regardless of the circumstances. The ex-boyfriend is at fault for not setting boundaries with the other woman when she was flirting and for being hypocritical about spending time together. The girlfriend (the other woman) is at fault for actively trying to drive a wedge between the author and her boyfriend and for inappropriate behavior toward someone in a relationship. The guild leader is arguably just trying to keep the peace, but the overall situation is the result of poor communication, boundary-setting, and emotional management by all parties involved.

Explanation:  
The author is not at fault for wanting her fiancée to cut contact with someone who is persistently harassing her. The fiancée is not at fault either, as she is in a difficult situation—she has tried to set boundaries, has blocked him on most platforms, and is trying to manage the situation without involving her family or escalating things further. The real problem is Hank, but he is not a party to this question. The author is simply expressing her feelings and seeking advice, not demanding or controlling her fiancée. Therefore, in the context of the question ""AITA for wanting my fiancée to stop being his friend?""—nobody is at fault.",stop,1407,150,1557

Explanation: This is a fundamental values conflict about child health and safety, not a situation where either party is behaving maliciously or unreasonably given their beliefs. The author was upfront about their stance from the beginning, and the fiancée initially agreed but is now expressing her true feelings. The author is not at fault for holding firm on a non-negotiable issue regarding their future children's health, nor is the fiancée at fault for having strong beliefs (even if they are not evidence-based). The relationship may not be compatible, but neither party is behaving in a way that makes them ""at fault"" in a moral sense.",stop,1024,138,1162

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
The author is not at fault for not wanting to continue a romantic or sexual relationship after learning new information that changes their attraction or compatibility. They are entitled to their boundaries and preferences, and it is not manipulative or evil to end a relationship for these reasons. The other person is also not necessarily at fault for not disclosing their trans status earlier, as this can be a difficult and personal decision, especially in the context of dating and safety. The emotional reactions on both sides are understandable given the situation, but neither party is acting with clear malice or intent to harm.

While the situation is extremely complex and involves trauma, manipulation, and mental health struggles, the author is specifically asking about their own actions—engaging with an abusive ex in a way that is secretive and would hurt their current partner if discovered. The author acknowledges that this is wrong and is not excusing it, but rather explaining the context and their motivations (self-preservation, lack of support, trauma responses). The ex (T) is clearly abusive and at fault for his actions, but the question is about the author's own responsibility in the current situation. The boyfriend (A) could have been more empathetic, but the main breach of trust and secrecy is on the author's part. Therefore, in the context of the question (""how much of an asshole am I""), the answer is: Author.",stop,1152,176,1328

Explanation: The author is a 14-year-old expressing anger and frustration at a difficult and unhealthy family situation involving an abusive adult. It is normal and understandable for a child to feel upset in such circumstances. The adults (mother, grandmother) may be making poor decisions, but the author is not at fault for their feelings or for being upset. The blame for the situation lies with the abusive boyfriend and, to some extent, the adults for allowing it to continue, but not with the child for their emotional response.",stop,1006,115,1121

Final Answer: Author

Explanation: While the friend is clearly in the wrong for ghosting the author, not paying for work, and not honoring their agreement, the author is asking if they would be the asshole (""WIBTA"") if they ""completely fucked his shit"" (i.e., sabotaged the business or took revenge). Taking such drastic action would be unethical and potentially illegal, regardless of the original wrongdoing. The correct and reasonable course would be to pursue legal action or at least attempt to resolve the matter civilly. Therefore, the author would be at fault if they chose to ""completely fuck his shit"" over the dispute.",stop,977,137,1114

Explanation: While the author has clearly made significant positive changes and is remorseful, the question is about whether they would be at fault (""the asshole"") for reaching out to their ex after causing her significant pain and trauma during their addiction.

Final Answer: Nobody

This is a difficult and emotionally complex situation, but based on the information provided, it does not appear that either party is wholly at fault in a way that would make them ""the asshole."" The author tried to support their girlfriend through difficult times, but ultimately realized the relationship was not healthy for them and ended it. The girlfriend was struggling with her own issues and may have acted out of pain or insecurity, but that does not make her entirely at fault either. Both parties made mistakes, but neither is solely to blame for the relationship ending. This is a case of two people who were not compatible at that time, and both were dealing with their own struggles.",stop,1137,144,1281

Final Answer: Author

Explanation: While your friend's behavior is frustrating and disruptive, your response—especially the aggressive message telling him to ""just stop playing""—was unnecessarily harsh. You acknowledge that you regret the way you said it, which suggests you recognize your delivery was at fault. It's reasonable to be upset, but the way you communicated your feelings was not constructive and likely escalated the situation. Therefore, the author is at fault for how they handled the confrontation.",stop,1031,101,1132

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
You are not at fault for your boyfriend going to bed hungry. The situation escalated because you discovered he was not being honest with you, and his reaction (snatching the phone and hitting you in the face, even if accidental) was inappropriate. You left because you were upset and embarrassed, which is understandable. Your boyfriend is an adult and could have chosen to eat at the restaurant or make other arrangements for food. The lack of groceries at his home is not your responsibility, especially after the events that transpired. Therefore, nobody is at fault for him going to bed hungry in this context.",stop,898,135,1033

Explanation: While there are several issues in the relationship (including the boyfriend's overreaction and lack of trust), the specific question at the end is about whether the author was wrong to ask her boyfriend to buy her a car. Expecting or demanding a significant financial gift (a car) from a partner, especially when not married or sharing finances, is generally unreasonable, regardless of his family's wealth. The boyfriend's behavior in other parts of the scenario is problematic, but regarding the car request, the author is at fault.",stop,1107,116,1223

---

**Reasoning:**  
The author knowingly gave alcohol to a minor (her nephew) against his father's (her brother's) explicit parenting style and wishes, and did so without parental consent. While the family culture is permissive about drinking, and the author apologized and recognized her mistake, she still crossed a clear boundary by undermining her brother's rules for his own child.
