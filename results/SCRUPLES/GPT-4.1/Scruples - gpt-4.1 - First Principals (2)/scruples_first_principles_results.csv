   I dropped out of uni 2 years ago because I was planning on moving to a different country and going to Uni there. However, my parents didn't want to help me in any...",Author,Nobody,0.8,1.0,True,"<step_1>
The author is a 25-year-old who dropped out of university with plans to study abroad, but was unable to due to financial constraints. The author's parents have been more financially supportive of their younger sister. The author's father has been abusive and is now in a deteriorating health condition. The author's mother refuses to acknowledge the father's health issues and the potential danger he poses. The author suggested moving the father to a retirement home, but the mother is afraid of his reaction. The author felt relief when the father was choking, hoping he would die, and the mother called the author a monster for this.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of conformity suggests that individuals should adhere to societal norms and expectations. In this scenario, the author's feelings of relief at the prospect of their abusive father's death deviates from societal expectations of familial love and care. The mother's refusal to acknowledge the father's health issues and potential danger also deviates from societal norms of seeking help for those who are unable to care for themselves. 
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's feelings of relief at the prospect of their abusive father's death, while not conforming to societal norms, can be understood given the history of abuse. The mother's refusal to acknowledge the father's health issues and potential danger is not in line with societal norms of seeking help for those who are unable to care for themselves. However, her fear of his reaction is also understandable given his history of violence and refusal of medical treatment. 
</step_3>

The author's feelings, while not conforming to societal norms, are a result of a history of abuse and a desire for a better life. The mother's actions, while not conforming to societal norms, are driven by fear and a sense of pity. Both are reacting to a difficult situation in ways that may not conform to societal expectations but are understandable given their circumstances.

2. The author has had sex with others, including an ex, without informing their SO.
3. The author's SO has also had sex with others, including through a reactivated Tinder profile, without informing the author.
4. The author is upset because their SO is having sex with others but not with them.
5. The author feels they have no ground to stand on due to the nature of their open relationship and their own actions.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms.
2. The author and their SO agreed to an open relationship, which is a deviation from traditional relationship norms.
3. Both the author and their SO have acted in accordance with the agreed-upon norms of their open relationship by having sex with others.
4. However, they have not conformed to the norm of open communication in an open relationship, as they have not informed each other about their sexual encounters with others.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it can be concluded that both the author and their SO have not fully conformed to the norms of their open relationship. While they have adhered to the norm of having sex with others, they have not conformed to the norm of open communication, which is crucial in an open relationship. This lack of communication has led to feelings of hurt and jealousy. Therefore, both parties are at fault for not fully conforming to the norms of their open relationship.

1. The author had a sexual relationship with a woman who later became pregnant.
2. The woman claimed the child was not the author's but another man's.
3. The author has suspicions that the child may be his based on physical resemblance.
4. The author shared his suspicions with the man who believes he is the father.
5. The woman is upset with the author for sharing his suspicions.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics.
2. The author did not conform to the norm of silence in a potentially sensitive situation.
3. The woman conformed to societal expectations by attributing the child to her current partner.
4. The man who believes he is the father was conforming to the belief that the child was his, based on the woman's assertion.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author, by expressing his suspicions, deviated from the norm of silence in a potentially sensitive situation, which led to conflict. The woman, by attributing the child to her current partner, was conforming to societal expectations. The man who believes he is the father was also conforming to the belief that the child was his, based on the woman's assertion. However, the author's deviation from conformity led to the disruption of the status quo.
</step_3>

The author's actions, while not conforming to societal norms, were driven by a desire for truth and potential paternal responsibility. The woman's actions, while conforming to societal norms, may have been dishonest. The man who believes he is the father was conforming to the belief that the child was his, based on the woman's assertion, but was misled.

2. The boyfriend initially agreed with the author's decision not to have children.
3. The boyfriend's perspective seems to have changed after they got a puppy, and he has started mentioning having children.
4. The author still does not want children and is feeling pressure due to her boyfriend's changed perspective.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to acting in accordance with prevailing standards or customs. In this scenario, the author is not conforming to the societal expectation of having children. However, she was clear about her decision and her boyfriend initially agreed. The boyfriend's change of mind is creating a conflict, but it does not mean the author should conform if it goes against her personal beliefs and desires.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is not at fault for not wanting children. It is her personal decision and she has been clear about it from the beginning. The boyfriend's change of mind does not obligate her to conform to his new desire for children. It is important for both parties to communicate and understand each other's perspectives. If they cannot reach a consensus, it may lead to a fundamental incompatibility in their relationship.

1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to coincide with a group standard. 
2. The author's actions do not conform to the standard academic practice of earning grades through effort and understanding.
3. The teacher's offer to raise the grade in exchange for silence does not conform to ethical teaching standards.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's actions of threatening to report the teacher to manipulate her grade is unethical and does not conform to academic standards. The teacher's agreement to raise the grade to avoid a report is also unethical and does not conform to teaching standards.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and his girlfriend agreed not to exchange traditional Valentine's Day gifts.
2. The author planned to surprise his girlfriend with flowers despite their agreement.
3. The author confronted his girlfriend about a mistake she made, which made her feel bad.
4. The author gave his girlfriend the surprise flowers, which upset her because she felt it was wrong for him not to tell her about it.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the author did not conform to the agreement he made with his girlfriend about not exchanging traditional Valentine's Day gifts. His girlfriend, on the other hand, conformed to the agreement and was upset when the author did not.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is at fault. He made an agreement with his girlfriend and then broke it by surprising her with flowers. This action, while intended to be kind, was a breach of trust and did not conform to their agreement. His girlfriend's reaction was justified as she was operating under the assumption that they were both adhering to the agreement. 
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that the author, despite good intentions, broke the agreement he had with his girlfriend. This breach of trust upset her and caused tension in their relationship. The value of conformity was not upheld by the author, leading to the negative outcome.

In this scenario, the author did not conform to the societal expectation of being attracted to someone based on their physical appearance or personality. However, he did conform to the norm of open communication in relationships by expressing his feelings honestly.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author acted ethically by being honest about his feelings and not leading the woman on. His lack of attraction, whether physical or emotional, is a personal feeling that he cannot control. His decision to communicate this to the woman, although potentially hurtful, was honest and respectful. He did not conform to societal expectations of attraction, but he did conform to the norm of open communication.

3. The author pays court-ordered child support and has visitation rights every other weekend.
4. The ex-wife has asked the author for additional financial and time support due to their son's health condition.
5. The author has declined these requests, citing his financial situation and busy schedule.
6. The author believes he is fulfilling his obligations as outlined by the court order.
7. The ex-wife believes the author should contribute more due to the change in their son's health.
</step_1>

1. Conformity refers to acting in accordance with established standards, rules, or norms.
2. The author is conforming to the court-ordered child support and visitation schedule.
3. The ex-wife is asking the author to go beyond the court-ordered obligations due to their son's health condition.
4. The author's refusal to provide additional support is in conformity with the court order but may not be in conformity with societal expectations of a parent's responsibility towards their child's health.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author is adhering to the court-ordered child support and visitation schedule, which is in conformity with the legal requirements. However, the son's health condition has introduced new needs that were not anticipated in the original court order. While the author is not legally required to provide additional support, the ethical question arises whether he should contribute more as a parent, given the change in circumstances. The ex-wife's requests for additional support are based on the son's needs, not her personal desires. Therefore, while the author is conforming to the court order, he may not be conforming to broader ethical expectations of parental responsibility.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author is conforming to the legal requirements set by the court order. However, the ethical question of whether he should provide additional support given the change in his son's health condition is debatable. While he is not legally required to do so, the ethical expectations of parental responsibility may require him to contribute more.

4. The author has responsibilities towards his autistic sister, which would be disrupted by the requested services.
5. The girlfriend's sister has a history of being ungrateful and critical towards the author.

3. The author asked to borrow the friend's laptop for a quiz, but the friend initially refused.
4. The author stopped talking to the friend after this incident.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario can be seen in the author's expectation of reciprocity from their friend. The author has been conforming to the social norm of helping a friend in need and expects the friend to do the same. However, the friend's initial refusal to lend the laptop goes against this norm.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's reaction of cutting off communication with the friend can be seen as an emotional response to the perceived lack of reciprocity. However, the friend's initial refusal could be due to the past incident where the author damaged the laptop. Both parties have valid reasons for their actions, but the situation escalated due to a lack of effective communication and understanding.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's expectation of reciprocity is not unreasonable, but their reaction to the friend's initial refusal was not constructive. The friend's hesitation to lend the laptop, given the past incident, is also understandable. The situation could have been handled better with open communication and understanding from both sides.

4. The author is upset because they believe Judy should not have gone on the trip if she could not afford it.
5. The author lives in Judy's apartment and pays her rent monthly.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' implies adhering to social norms or expectations. In this scenario, the expectation that the author should pay for Judy's trip because they have a savings account is a form of conformity. However, the author's belief that Judy should not have gone on the trip if she could not afford it also represents a form of conformity to the norm of financial responsibility.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, it is not ethically required for the author to pay for Judy's trip just because they have a savings account. The author has already fulfilled their financial obligation by paying back Olivia for their own trip. The expectation that the author should pay for Judy's trip because they have a savings account is not a universally accepted norm and is more of an assumption made by Olivia. On the other hand, Judy's decision to go on a trip she could not afford does not conform to the norm of financial responsibility.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author is not ethically obligated to pay for Judy's trip just because they have a savings account. The expectation set by Olivia is not a universally accepted norm. Judy's decision to go on a trip she could not afford does not conform to the norm of financial responsibility.

3. The boyfriend found out the truth and is upset, calling the author a liar and ignoring her.
4. The author and her boyfriend are in a committed relationship and are considering marriage.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity', which implies adhering to social norms or standards. In the context of a relationship, honesty and trust are generally accepted norms. The author's actions of lying about her middle name, even if intended as a joke, deviate from these norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of honesty and trust in a relationship, the author's actions can be seen as a breach of these principles. Even though the lie was about something seemingly insignificant and intended as a joke, it still constitutes a deviation from the norm of honesty. The boyfriend's reaction, while perhaps extreme, is understandable given the breach of trust.

1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard.
2. The author is conforming to the coworker's requests for shift coverage, despite feeling taken advantage of.
3. The coworker is not conforming to the reciprocal nature of shift coverage, creating an imbalance.
4. The author's inability to take time off due to the coworker's frequent requests is a deviation from the norm, indicating a lack of conformity on the coworker's part.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author is conforming to the coworker's requests for shift coverage, despite feeling taken advantage of. This is a clear indication of the author's adherence to the value of conformity. However, the coworker is not reciprocating, which is a deviation from the norm and a lack of conformity. The author's exhaustion and need for a break are valid concerns, and their inability to take time off due to the coworker's frequent requests is a clear indication of an imbalance in the workplace. 
</step_3>

The author is not at fault for feeling taken advantage of, as the coworker's behavior is not conforming to the norm of reciprocal shift coverage.

So Kylie is my best friend. She's 24, I'm 23. She's been with Avery for 2 years now. They moved SUP...",Author,Everybody,0.8,0.6538461538461539,False,"<step_1>
1. The author and Kylie are best friends.
2. Kylie is in a relationship with Avery, which the author perceives as moving too fast.
3. The author believes Avery is taking advantage of Kylie, based on observations of their living arrangements and shared resources.
4. Kylie and Avery are now engaged, which the author sees as a red flag.
5. The author expressed these concerns to Kylie, leading to a fight and potential end of their friendship.
6. The author is questioning whether they are at fault for expressing their concerns.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests that individuals should adhere to societal norms and expectations.
2. The author's concerns about Kylie's relationship stem from perceived deviations from these norms, such as the speed of the relationship and the perceived imbalance in shared responsibilities and resources.
3. Kylie's reaction to the author's concerns suggests she may not see these deviations as problematic, indicating a potential difference in their interpretations of conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
1. The author's concerns are based on their interpretation of societal norms and expectations, which they believe Kylie's relationship is deviating from.
2. However, Kylie's acceptance of these deviations suggests she may have a different interpretation of what constitutes conformity.
3. The author's decision to express their concerns was based on their interpretation of conformity, but this led to conflict due to Kylie's differing interpretation.
4. Therefore, the fault does not lie solely with the author or Kylie, but rather in the clash of their interpretations of conformity.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's concerns about Kylie's relationship are based on their interpretation of societal norms and expectations, which they believe are not being met. However, Kylie's acceptance of the situation suggests she may have a different interpretation of what constitutes conformity.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and the girl have a hostile relationship.
2. The girl has previously insulted the author and attempted to get her suspended.
3. The author has discovered the girl's YouTube channel.
4. The author is considering leaving mean comments on the girl's YouTube channel as a form of retaliation.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' implies adhering to social norms and standards of behavior. In this context, it would mean treating others with respect and not resorting to online harassment, regardless of personal conflicts.
1. The girl's previous actions towards the author do not conform to respectful behavior.
2. The author's consideration to leave mean comments on the girl's YouTube channel also does not conform to respectful behavior.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of 'Conformity', both the girl's actions and the author's proposed response are inappropriate. The girl's insults and attempt to get the author suspended are disrespectful. However, the author's plan to retaliate by leaving mean comments on the girl's YouTube channel is also disrespectful and constitutes online harassment. Instead, the author should address the issue directly with the girl or involve a responsible adult if necessary.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that both parties are not adhering to the value of 'Conformity'. The girl's actions towards the author are disrespectful, and the author's proposed response is also inappropriate and disrespectful.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author planned to visit his mother on Mother's Day for half an hour.
2. The author's 6-year-old daughter expressed a desire to accompany him.
3. The author agreed to his daughter's request.
4. The author's partner disagreed with this decision, arguing that the daughter should spend Mother's Day with her mother only.
5. The partner convinced the daughter to stay home while the author was downstairs.
6. The partner accused the author of being selfish and potentially ruining Mother's Day for the family.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the partner seems to be enforcing a norm that Mother's Day should be spent with the child's mother only. The author, on the other hand, does not see a problem with the child spending a small portion of the day with her grandmother.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it seems that the author is not conforming to the partner's expectation of how Mother's Day should be spent. However, it is not inherently unethical for the author to allow his daughter to visit her grandmother on Mother's Day. The partner's insistence on conformity to her view of Mother's Day could be seen as an attempt to control the situation and does not necessarily make it the ethical standard. The partner's approach to convince the child to stay home without discussing it with the author could also be seen as undermining the author's decision, which is not ethically sound.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The author's decision to let his daughter accompany him to visit her grandmother on Mother's Day does not seem to be unethical. The partner's insistence on conformity to her view of Mother's Day and her approach to convince the child to stay home without discussing it with the author could be seen as controlling and undermining, which is not ethically sound.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author has a condition known as ""Skin Hunger"" which requires regular physical affection to maintain their mental and emotional state.
2. This need for physical affection is not sexual in nature.
3. The author's past relationships have failed when they insisted on regular physical affection.
4. The author perceives their need for physical affection as a normal part of a relationship, but their partners have viewed it as toxic.
5. The author values conformity, which in this context could mean conforming to their own needs and expectations in a relationship.
</step_1>

<step_2>
These truths interact with the value of conformity in the following ways:
1. The author's need for physical affection is a personal requirement that they expect their partners to conform to.
2. The author's partners have not conformed to this expectation, viewing it as toxic and leading to the end of the relationship.
3. The author's insistence on this form of affection could be seen as a lack of conformity to their partners' comfort levels or boundaries.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that the author is not necessarily at fault for having a need for physical affection due to their condition. However, insisting on this need without considering their partners' comfort levels or boundaries could be seen as a lack of respect for their partners' needs and feelings. On the other hand, the partners are not necessarily at fault for not conforming to the author's needs if they are uncomfortable with the level of physical affection required. It's a matter of compatibility and communication.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's need for physical affection due to their condition is valid, but their insistence on it without considering their partners' comfort levels could be seen as a lack of respect for their partners' needs. The partners are not at fault for not conforming to the author's needs if they are uncomfortable with the level of physical affection required. It's a matter of compatibility and communication.

3. Joseph did not conform by initiating a kiss with the author, knowing she was in a relationship.
4. Toni conformed by not blaming the author for Joseph's actions.

1. The author is an occupational therapist's assistant.
2. The author experienced pain due to an ovarian cyst and took a narcotic to manage it.
3. The author felt sick the next day, presumably due to the narcotic, and informed her boss that she couldn't come to work.
4. The boss asked for a doctor's note upon the author's return, despite there being no known policy requiring this.
5. The author did not visit a doctor during this time.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or policies.
2. The author did not conform to the expectation of providing a doctor's note, as she did not visit a doctor.
3. The boss's request for a doctor's note may or may not conform to company policy, as the author is unaware of any such policy.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author did not conform to the boss's request for a doctor's note, but it's unclear whether this request conforms to company policy. The author's actions were based on her understanding of her health condition and the lack of a known policy requiring a doctor's note. The boss's request may be a standard expectation in some workplaces, but without clear communication or policy, it's not reasonable to expect the author to conform to it.

2. In this scenario, the teenager is torn between conforming to their dad's wish to watch the movie together and their own desire to watch it with their friends.

Based on the principles of conformity, the teenager is in a situation where they have to choose between conforming to familial norms (watching the movie with their dad) or peer norms (watching the movie with their friends). There is no clear right or wrong choice here, as both options involve a form of conformity. The teenager's feelings of being too old to watch movies with their dad is a subjective feeling and not a universal truth.

2. The best friend and others repeatedly pressured the author to admit a romantic interest in the best friend.
3. The author, under pressure, eventually admitted to having a crush on the best friend.
4. The author later realized he did not have romantic feelings for the best friend and communicated this to her.
5. The best friend reacted negatively to this, calling the author mentally weak.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity'. The author conformed to the pressure from his friends and admitted to having a crush on his best friend, even though he later realized this was not true. The best friend and others also conformed to a common narrative that the author should have romantic feelings for his best friend.
</step_2>

Based on these principles, it is clear that the author was influenced by the pressure from his friends to conform to their expectations. However, he later realized his true feelings and communicated them honestly to his best friend. The best friend's reaction, calling the author mentally weak, is not a fair or respectful response to his honesty.

3. The friend has made loud, inappropriate comments in public settings, causing discomfort to the author and others.
4. The author is considering telling the friend that she is making the LGBT community look bad.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario relates to the friend's behavior and how it aligns with societal norms and expectations. The friend's behavior is non-conforming, both in terms of gender norms (as perceived by the author) and social etiquette (making loud, inappropriate comments). The author's discomfort seems to stem from this non-conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it's clear that the friend's behavior is causing discomfort to the author and potentially others. However, it's important to note that everyone has the right to express themselves as they see fit, as long as it doesn't harm others. The friend's behavior, while non-conforming and potentially disruptive, is not inherently harmful. The author's intention to tell the friend she's making the LGBT community look bad is based on their personal perception and may not be a fair judgement. It would be more constructive for the author to express their personal discomfort with the friend's behavior, rather than making a broad statement about the LGBT community.

Step 4: The friend's non-conforming behavior is causing discomfort to the author, but it's not inherently harmful. The author's intention to tell the friend she's making the LGBT community look bad is based on their personal perception and may not be a fair judgement. It would be more constructive for the author to express their personal discomfort with the friend's behavior.

3. The author decided to leave the group but has been delaying the decision due to various events.
4. The author is unsure if her feelings and decisions are justified.
</step_1>

<step_2>

However, her friends are also not wrong for developing new interests and friendships. The author's decision to leave the group is a personal one and should be communicated honestly and respectfully. It's important to remember that friendships evolve and sometimes people grow apart, which is a natural part of life.

1. The author has been working with a colleague who doesn't believe in using soap or washing.
2. The colleague's lack of hygiene has resulted in a noticeable odor and visible grime.
3. The author has tried to subtly hint at the issue over a few months, but the colleague has not changed his behavior.
4. The author finally confronted the colleague directly about his hygiene in front of others, which upset the colleague.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of 'Conformity' implies adhering to social norms and standards, which in most cultures includes maintaining personal hygiene.
2. The colleague's refusal to use soap or wash goes against this value, as it disrupts the comfort and health of those around him.
3. The author's attempts to address the issue, both subtly and directly, can be seen as efforts to enforce conformity to hygiene norms.
4. The public confrontation, however, may have violated norms of respect and privacy.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the colleague's lack of hygiene is a clear violation of the value of conformity. However, the author's method of addressing the issue, particularly the public confrontation, also goes against norms of respect and privacy. While the author's frustration is understandable, a more private and empathetic approach may have been more ethical.

37,So yeah title and a little bit more details. My mom has always been terrible with money and as a teenager I would lend her quite significant sums of money to help her hide it from my dad as I thought ...,Other,Everybody,0.9,1.0,True,"<step_1>
The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The mother has a history of poor financial management and has borrowed money from her children.
2. The author has previously helped the mother hide her financial issues from the father.
3. The mother has recently borrowed a significant amount of money from the author's 17-year-old brother.
4. The author has not yet informed the father about the mother's financial issues.
5. The author believes the mother to be manipulative and possibly narcissistic.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this context refers to adhering to societal norms and expectations, which include honesty and transparency in familial relationships, and protecting minors from financial exploitation. The mother's actions of borrowing money from her children, especially a minor, and hiding her financial issues from her spouse, are in direct violation of these norms. The author's actions of aiding the mother in hiding her financial issues and not informing the father also violate these norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of honesty, transparency, and protection of minors, the mother's actions are unethical. She has exploited her children financially and has been dishonest with her spouse about her financial situation. The author's actions are also unethical, as they have enabled the mother's behavior by helping her hide her financial issues and not informing the father about the situation. However, the author's realization of the mother's manipulative behavior and their concern for their siblings indicate a willingness to rectify the situation.

She is comfortable with the dynamics of her relationship, which do not conform to traditional norms.

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to match those of other people or societal norms.

The author is not at fault for expressing her feelings of being left out and wanting to be included in the trip. However, the boyfriend is also not at fault for wanting to maintain his tradition with his friends. The friends' decision to invite the author only if someone else backs out is a practical consideration due to limited space, not a personal slight.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. Both partners deeply desire to have children.
2. The female partner has a highly heritable autoimmune disease.
3. The severity of the disease varies greatly from person to person.
4. The male partner is uncomfortable with the risk of their potential children inheriting the disease.
5. The male partner has expressed a preference for biological children over adoption.
6. The female partner is upset by the male partner's decision not to have children due to the risk of disease inheritance.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this context refers to adhering to societal norms or expectations. In many societies, having biological children is seen as a norm or expectation for couples. However, the male partner's decision to not have children due to the risk of disease inheritance deviates from this norm. The female partner's upset reaction could be seen as a response to this deviation from societal expectations.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, the male partner's decision to not have children due to the risk of disease inheritance is a personal choice made in consideration of potential future suffering. While it deviates from societal norms, it is a decision made with the potential child's wellbeing in mind. The female partner's upset reaction is understandable given the shared dream of having children and the societal expectation to do so. However, the male partner's preference for biological children over adoption further complicates the situation, as it limits the options for fulfilling their shared dream without risking disease inheritance.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that while the male partner's decision deviates from societal norms, it is made with the potential child's wellbeing in mind. The female partner's reaction is understandable, but the situation is complicated by the male partner's preference for biological children.

2. The girlfriend has expressed a desire to get married immediately, without the presence of family or friends.
3. The author wants to wait before getting married, citing reasons such as wanting to move in together first and save money for a proper wedding.
4. The girlfriend suggested getting married on an upcoming holiday, to which the author responded that it's too soon.
5. The girlfriend is now not talking to the author.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' refers to the adherence to social norms or standards. In this scenario, the author is adhering to the traditional steps of a relationship, which typically involve dating, moving in together, and then getting married. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is suggesting a non-traditional approach to marriage, which deviates from the norm.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is not at fault for wanting to adhere to traditional relationship steps before getting married. It's reasonable to want to live together and save money for a wedding before making such a significant commitment. The girlfriend's desire to get married immediately is not wrong either, but it does not conform to the traditional norms. Her refusal to communicate after the author expressed his concerns, however, is not conducive to a healthy relationship.

The logical conclusion is that the author is not at fault for wanting to follow traditional relationship steps before getting married. The girlfriend's refusal to communicate after the author expressed his concerns is not conducive to a healthy relationship.

In this context, it could refer to the norms of communication and respect within a relationship, as well as the norms of co-parenting after a separation or divorce. The author's frequent discussions about his ex could be seen as non-conformity to the norm of focusing on the present relationship. However, his concern for his children's welfare aligns with the norm of parental responsibility.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's concern for his children's welfare is valid. However, the frequency and nature of his discussions about his ex may be causing unnecessary strain on his current relationship. His partner's request for him to stop discussing his ex could be seen as a request for respect and focus on their current relationship. The author's suspicion about the misuse of child support and alimony payments, while concerning, is currently speculative and may need further investigation before making accusations.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's concern for his children is understandable and aligns with the principle of parental responsibility. However, his frequent discussions about his ex may not conform to the norms of respect and focus within a new relationship. His partner's request for less discussion about the ex is also valid, as it may be causing strain on their relationship. The author's suspicions about financial misuse need further investigation.

1. The author liked a photo on Instagram as a joke on his sister's account.
2. The sister was upset by this action.
3. The author dismissed his sister's feelings as overreaction.
4. The author later apologized, but the sister remained upset.
5. The sister's friends agreed with her that the author's actions were unacceptable.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity implies respecting social norms and boundaries.
2. The author's action of liking the photo on his sister's account without her consent violates the norm of respecting personal boundaries.
3. The author's dismissal of his sister's feelings also goes against the norm of acknowledging and respecting others' emotions.
4. The sister's reaction and her friends' agreement indicate a social consensus that the author's actions were inappropriate, reinforcing the value of conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author violated the principle of conformity by not respecting his sister's personal boundaries and dismissing her feelings. His actions were not in line with social norms, as indicated by the sister's and her friends' reactions. Therefore, the author is at fault for the situation. However, he could have handled the situation better by immediately acknowledging his mistake and apologizing sincerely, instead of dismissing his sister's feelings.

1. The author and Amanda were in a relationship and exchanged nude pictures.
2. They broke up, and Amanda asked the author to delete her pictures.
3. The author refused, stating he would not share them or use them for blackmail, but keep them for personal enjoyment.
4. Amanda deleted the author's pictures.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to match those of other people or societal norms.
2. The societal norm in this case would be respecting the privacy and wishes of others, especially in sensitive matters like explicit images.
3. The author is not conforming to this norm by refusing to delete Amanda's pictures despite her request.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principle of conformity, the author is in the wrong. He is not conforming to the societal norm of respecting others' privacy and wishes. Even though he claims he will not misuse the pictures, he is still disregarding Amanda's explicit request for him to delete them. This is a violation of her privacy and autonomy.
</step_3>

The author is at fault for not respecting Amanda's wishes and privacy, which is against the societal norm of conformity.

4. The author is frustrated and angry but has not communicated these feelings to anyone involved.
5. The dog has not shown aggression in this situation.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard. 
2. The author is trying to help the dog conform to social norms around people and other animals.
3. The cousin's behavior does not conform to the norms of how to interact with a dog, particularly one with the dog's history.
4. The author has not conformed to the norm of communicating discomfort or dissatisfaction in a situation.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author is not at fault for feeling protective of their dog and wanting to ensure its comfort and safety. However, the author is at fault for not communicating their concerns about the cousin's behavior towards the dog. The cousin, due to their Down syndrome, may not fully understand the impact of their actions on the dog. It is the responsibility of the adults in the situation to guide the cousin's behavior and ensure the dog's comfort and safety. Therefore, the fault lies with both the author and the other adults present.

</step_2>

<step_3>
1. The author is not at fault for having feelings for the man and expressing them to M.
2. M is not at fault for developing feelings for the man, but she is at fault for not considering the author's feelings and pursuing a relationship with the man despite knowing it would hurt the author.
3. The author is not at fault for ending the friendship as M chose the man over their friendship.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author had a reasonable expectation that M would respect her feelings and not pursue a relationship with the man she was interested in.

1. The author and his ex-girlfriend broke up.
2. They were living together in an apartment, but the lease is only in the ex-girlfriend's name.
3. The author has no legal obligation to pay for the apartment.
4. The author has already paid for January's rent, despite not living there.
5. The ex-girlfriend has a good job, a full ride, and parents to help her.
6. The author's mother believes he owes his ex-girlfriend nothing.
7. The author is considering whether to continue paying his half of the rent.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' suggests adhering to social norms or expectations. In this case, it could be interpreted as the expectation to fulfill one's commitments, even in the absence of a legal obligation. The author's decision to move out and not pay rent could be seen as non-conformity if the social expectation is to continue supporting a shared living arrangement until a suitable replacement can be found.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is not legally obligated to pay for the apartment. However, considering the value of 'Conformity', it could be argued that there is a social expectation to continue paying his share until the ex-girlfriend can find a replacement. This is complicated by the fact that the ex-girlfriend appears to have sufficient resources to cover the rent on her own. Therefore, the author's decision to stop paying rent could be seen as non-conformity, but it is not necessarily unethical given the circumstances.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The author's decision to stop paying rent, while potentially non-conformist, is not necessarily unethical given the circumstances. The ex-girlfriend appears to have sufficient resources to cover the rent on her own, and the author has no legal obligation to continue paying. Therefore, while the decision may not align with social expectations, it is not inherently wrong.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author believes in gender equality but is against third wave feminism.
2. The author believes that women are more privileged in modern society due to past oppression.
3. The author has a personal opinion that most women dress inappropriately.
4. The author finds it sickening and unnatural for a significantly older man to have a sexual relationship with a young woman.
5. The author's friend disagrees with his views and labels him as sexist and an asshole.
6. The author and his friend have been in conflict over these issues for three years.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. 
1. The author's beliefs do not conform to those of his friend or, presumably, to the norms of third wave feminism.
2. The author's views on women's dressing and relationships do not conform to what he perceives as the norm in modern society.
3. The author's friend expects him to conform to her beliefs or societal norms, which he resists.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is not conforming to the norms of his friend or the societal norms he perceives. However, he is not obligated to conform if his beliefs are different. His friend is also not obligated to conform to his beliefs. The conflict arises from their inability to respect each other's differing views. The author's language and generalizations about women could be seen as disrespectful, which may contribute to the conflict.

6. The lead tech responded with a comment about the author's weight.
7. The lead tech is uncomfortable with being 'picked' on for being scrawny.
8. The work environment has changed as a result of this exchange.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to coincide with a group standard.
2. The author's comment about the lead tech's weight deviated from professional norms, which typically discourage personal remarks about physical appearance.
3. The lead tech's response also deviated from these norms.
4. The change in the work environment suggests that the exchange disrupted the group's standard of conduct.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author initiated the exchange by making a comment about the lead tech's weight, which deviated from professional norms. The lead tech responded in kind, also deviating from these norms. Both parties contributed to the disruption of the group's standard of conduct, which is contrary to the value of conformity.

Step 4: The author and the lead tech both deviated from professional norms by making personal remarks about each other's physical appearance. This disrupted the group's standard of conduct, which is contrary to the value of conformity. Therefore, both parties are at fault.

2. Their father, a retired Army veteran, has set a condition that they must run two miles, three times a week to attend CAP.
3. The author has been making efforts to improve their physical fitness, including running and home workouts.
4. The father has a strict approach to discipline and obedience, and uses punishments as incentives for better behavior.
5. There was a disagreement between the author and their father about the necessity of running in cold, rainy weather and the type of workout done instead.
6. The father accused the author of gaslighting him when they pointed out a contradiction in his statements.
7. The author believes that they should face the natural consequences of their decisions to develop self-discipline.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity is about adhering to social norms or rules.
2. The father's insistence on strict obedience and discipline aligns with the value of conformity.
3. The author's decision to not run in cold, rainy weather and do a home workout instead deviates from the agreed-upon rule, which is against the value of conformity.
4. The author's belief in facing natural consequences for their decisions shows a desire for personal growth and self-discipline, which can be seen as a form of conformity to societal expectations of maturity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The father's approach to discipline and obedience aligns with the value of conformity. However, his inability to acknowledge the author's efforts to improve their physical fitness and his harsh reaction to the author's logical argument shows a lack of understanding and empathy. The author, on the other hand, has shown a willingness to conform to the rules set by their father, but also believes in the importance of understanding the reasons behind their actions. Their decision to not run in adverse weather conditions and do a home workout instead shows a level of maturity and self-discipline. The disagreement seems to stem from a difference in understanding and communication rather than a lack of conformity.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author's 10-week old puppy was attacked by the sister-in-law's 10-month old French bulldog, which resulted in severe injuries to the puppy.
2. The mother-in-law placed the puppy on the ground near the French bulldog, which has a history of food aggression.
3. The mother-in-law and sister-in-law have not apologized for the incident.
4. The author is angry and upset about the incident and the lack of remorse shown by the family members.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario would imply that the author should conform to the family's apparent lack of concern for the incident and not cause a rift. However, the author's anger and demand for an apology are in conflict with this value, as they are not conforming to the family's attitude.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it is clear that the author is not conforming to the family's lack of concern for the incident. However, the author's demand for an apology and concern for their puppy's well-being are justified. The mother-in-law and sister-in-law's lack of remorse and responsibility for the incident is ethically questionable.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that the author is justified in their anger and demand for an apology. The mother-in-law and sister-in-law's lack of remorse and responsibility for the incident is ethically questionable. The author is not conforming to the family's lack of concern, but this non-conformity is justified in this case.

3. The author's reaction to the criticism shows a desire to conform to the group's standards, as they feel guilty and question their actions.
</step_2>

<step_3>
1. The author's action of buying a low-priced item to resell it at a higher price is a common practice in commerce and is not inherently unethical.
2. The criticism from the group member reflects their personal view, not a universal ethical standard.
3. The author's guilt and self-doubt stem from their desire to conform to the group's standards, not from an objective ethical violation.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's intention to flip an item on eBay is not inherently unethical. The criticism they received reflects a personal view rather than a universal ethical standard.

5. The author believes that living under his mother's roof does not entitle her to know his private financial matters.
6. The author will be moving abroad soon and will need his money.

1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard. In this case, the group standard could be the mother's expectation of financial transparency.
2. The author is not conforming to his mother's expectation of knowing his bank balance.
3. The author is conforming to a broader societal norm of financial privacy and independence.

Based on the principles, the author is not conforming to his mother's expectations, which could be seen as a breach of conformity within the family unit. However, he is conforming to a broader societal norm of financial privacy and independence, especially considering his age and future plans. Therefore, the author's actions can be seen as a balance between these two forms of conformity.

3. The author referred to the clocks as ""junk"" in a conversation with the mother.
4. The mother sent a picture of the clocks to the author, referring to them as ""junk"" as well.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the author is not conforming to the norm of accepting gifts graciously, instead expressing disinterest and even disdain for the gifts. The mother, on the other hand, is conforming to the norm of giving gifts to show affection or care.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it can be concluded that the author's reaction to the gifts was not in line with typical norms of accepting gifts. However, the mother also did not heed the author's expressed wishes to not receive gifts. Both parties did not conform to the expectations of the other, leading to a conflict.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author is in remission from ovarian cancer and has had several surgeries, which have left her with a weakened immune system and scar tissue pain.
2. The author and her husband have moved to his hometown for his job and are living with his father rent-free to help with their debt.
3. The husband has been pressuring the author to find a job despite her health issues.
4. The author was trying to apply for jobs while her husband was playing loud music, which she found distracting and inconsiderate.
5. The husband believes the author should have left the room if she found the noise distracting.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario would imply that the author and her husband should adhere to certain norms or standards of behavior. This could include respecting each other's needs and space, especially when one is trying to focus on an important task such as job applications. The husband's behavior of playing loud music while the author was trying to concentrate does not conform to this standard.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it can be concluded that the husband's behavior was inconsiderate. He was aware of the author's need to focus on her job applications and her sensory overload issues, yet he chose to play loud music. His suggestion that the author should have left the room does not take into account her need for a quiet environment to focus on her applications. Therefore, his behavior does not conform to the standard of respecting each other's needs and space.
</step_3>

Step 4: The husband's behavior was inconsiderate and did not conform to the standard of respecting each other's needs and space. He was aware of the author's need to focus on her job applications and her sensory overload issues, yet he chose to play loud music.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author dislikes their own birthday but makes a significant effort to celebrate the birthdays of their family members.
2. The author's family members, including their fiancé, have consistently forgotten the author's birthday.
3. The author feels unappreciated and is considering expressing their feelings to their family.
4. The author is also considering stopping the celebration of others' birthdays to avoid feeling disappointed on their own.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' suggests adhering to social norms or expectations. In this scenario, the author is conforming to the social norm of celebrating birthdays for their family members. However, their family members are not conforming to the same norm when it comes to the author's birthday.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is not at fault for expecting a reciprocal gesture from their family members. It is a common social expectation to acknowledge and celebrate someone's birthday, especially when that person makes an effort to celebrate others'. The family members, including the fiancé, are not conforming to this social norm, which is causing the author to feel unappreciated. However, the author has not yet communicated their feelings to their family, which could potentially resolve the issue.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author's friend has a traumatic past and is constantly reminding the author about it.
2. The author is feeling uncomfortable and annoyed by these constant reminders.
3. The author is not blaming the friend for her past but is upset about the constant negativity.
4. The author's excitement and positive feelings are often shot down by the friend's comments.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario can be interpreted as the author's desire for a normal, positive interaction with the friend. The friend's constant reminders of her traumatic past disrupt this conformity, leading to the author's discomfort and annoyance.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it is logical to conclude that the author is not at fault for feeling uncomfortable and annoyed. It is natural to want positive and normal interactions with friends. However, the friend's constant reminders of her traumatic past disrupt this normalcy, leading to the author's discomfort. While the friend's past is unfortunate, it is not the author's responsibility to constantly bear the burden of her trauma. It would be beneficial for both parties if the friend sought professional help to deal with her past.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author is not at fault for feeling uncomfortable and annoyed due to the friend's constant reminders of her traumatic past.

1. The author and their friend made a pact to make their post-high school decisions together.
2. The author got accepted into their dream school and is excited about it.
3. The friend's academic performance has declined and he is not in a position to join the author at the dream school.
4. The friend feels betrayed because the author is breaking the pact and is excited about it.
5. The author feels guilty but is determined to go to the dream school.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of 'Conformity' suggests that the author should stick to the pact made with the friend.
2. However, the author's excitement and determination to go to the dream school contradicts this value.
3. The friend's feelings of betrayal align with the value of 'Conformity' as he expected the author to stick to the pact.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author is in a difficult position where they have to choose between their personal ambition and a promise made to a friend. While breaking the pact contradicts the value of 'Conformity', it is also important to consider the author's personal growth and opportunities. The friend's feelings of betrayal are understandable, but it is also not fair to expect the author to give up a significant opportunity because of a pact made under stress and fear.

6. The author asked her husband to return to the restaurant to correct the order.
7. The husband refused, stating he was too tired.
8. The situation escalated into an argument, resulting in both parties not speaking to each other.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard or expectation.
2. In this scenario, the expectation was that the husband would correctly order and bring home the author's desired meal.
3. The husband did not conform to this expectation, resulting in the author's dissatisfaction.
4. The husband's refusal to rectify the situation further deviated from the expectation, causing further conflict.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it can be concluded that the husband did not conform to the expectation set by the author. However, the author's reaction to the situation also escalated the conflict. The husband's refusal to return to the restaurant may be seen as a lack of care or consideration, but it could also be due to fatigue or other factors not mentioned in the scenario. The author's insistence on the husband returning to the restaurant, despite his refusal, also contributed to the escalation of the situation.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and his girlfriend were planning a day out.
2. The author suggested a plan that included picking up an item his girlfriend had mentioned before.
3. The girlfriend clarified she didn't want the item and didn't want to go to the place where it was available.
4. The author responded with ""okie, it was just a suggestion..."" which was perceived as passive-aggressive by the girlfriend.
5. The girlfriend reacted strongly to the author's response, interpreting it as a negative reaction to her not wanting to go somewhere.
6. The author tried to continue planning the day out, but the girlfriend kept focusing on the author's previous response.
7. The girlfriend accused the author of turning a simple statement into a fight.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of conformity in this scenario would imply that both parties should strive to maintain harmony and avoid conflict. The author tried to conform by suggesting a plan that he thought would please his girlfriend. The girlfriend, however, did not conform to the author's plan and expressed her disagreement. The author's response, perceived as passive-aggressive, did not conform to the girlfriend's expectation of a neutral or positive response. The girlfriend's strong reaction and subsequent focus on the author's response also did not conform to the goal of maintaining harmony and avoiding conflict.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, it seems that both parties contributed to the conflict. The author's response, whether intended or not, was perceived as passive-aggressive, which deviated from the value of conformity. The girlfriend's strong reaction and focus on the author's response also escalated the situation, deviating from the value of conformity. Both parties could have communicated more effectively to avoid misunderstanding and conflict.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and her husband have a family with two little kids.
2. The author stays at home to take care of the kids because daycare is more expensive than what she would make full time.
3. The husband is the sole earner in the family.
4. All bills and expenses are paid through the author's account.
5. The husband used to give the author 80% of his paycheck to cover these expenses, and the leftover was split into savings, money for the husband, and ""fun money"" for the author and the kids.
6. Recently, the husband has been giving the author only 45%-50% of his paycheck but still expects her to cover all expenses.
7. The author is struggling to pay the bills and buy groceries with the reduced amount.
8. The author wants more money from her husband to cover the family's expenses.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity', which refers to the adherence to social norms or standards. In this case, the social norm or standard is the agreement between the author and her husband about the division of his paycheck. The husband's recent change in behavior, giving less money but still expecting all bills to be paid, is not conforming to their established norm.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it is logical to conclude that the husband is not adhering to the agreed-upon division of his paycheck. This is causing financial stress for the author, who is unable to cover all expenses with the reduced amount. The author's desire for more money from her husband to cover the family's expenses is not unreasonable, given that she is responsible for managing the family's finances and ensuring all bills are paid. 
</step_3>

<step_4>
The husband's deviation from their agreed-upon financial arrangement is causing financial stress for the author and potentially jeopardizing the family's financial stability. The author's request for more money to cover the family's expenses is justified, given her role in managing the family's finances and the husband's continued expectation that she pay all bills.

2. The author's girlfriend visited him and they planned to have dinner at her parents' place.
3. The girlfriend forgot her glasses in the author's apartment and had difficulty locking the door.
4. The author, already in a bad mood and hungry, got angry and accidentally bumped into her while helping her lock the door.
5. The girlfriend decided to take the bus instead of riding with the author and accused him of having an ugly attitude.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity', which implies adhering to social norms and expectations. In this context, it would mean treating each other with respect and patience, even when one is in a bad mood. The author, being in a bad mood, did not conform to these expectations when he reacted angrily to his girlfriend's difficulty with the door. The girlfriend, on the other hand, also did not conform to the expectation of communicating her feelings calmly, instead choosing to scream at the author.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, both the author and his girlfriend did not conform to the expected norms of behavior. The author allowed his bad mood to affect his reaction to a minor inconvenience, while the girlfriend escalated the situation by screaming at him instead of expressing her feelings in a calm manner. However, it's important to note that everyone has bad days and can react poorly in certain situations. The key is to acknowledge the mistake and strive to handle similar situations better in the future.

1. Both the author and S deviated from the value of conformity: S by not following the agreed-upon plan, and the author by not continuing the conversation until a consensus was reached.
2. However, the author's deviation was a response to the unproductive nature of the conversation, while S's deviation directly impacted the group's dynamics.

5. The joke was not well received by the women and the author's friend.
6. The author apologized for the joke and recognizes in hindsight that it was inappropriate.
7. The author feels his friend was wrong in his approach to addressing the situation.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms. 
1. The author and his friend conform to the norm of regularly working out at the gym.
2. The women also conform to this norm.
3. The author's joke deviated from the norm of respectful communication, especially in a shared public space like a gym.
4. The women and the author's friend reacted negatively to this deviation, conforming to the norm of rejecting disrespectful or offensive comments.
5. The author's apology and reflection on his behavior shows an attempt to conform back to the norm of respectful communication.
6. The author's friend's reaction also conforms to the norm of calling out inappropriate behavior.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that the author deviated from the norm of respectful communication by making an inappropriate joke. The negative reactions from the women and the author's friend were in line with the norm of rejecting disrespectful comments. The author's subsequent apology and reflection show an attempt to conform back to the norm of respectful communication. The friend's reaction, while perhaps not delivered in the most constructive way, was also in line with the norm of calling out inappropriate behavior.
</step_3>

The author is at fault for making an inappropriate joke that deviated from the norm of respectful communication. While his friend could have addressed the situation in a more constructive way, his reaction was still in line with the norm of calling out inappropriate behavior.

5. The author and her boyfriend have made efforts to keep the shared spaces cleaner, but the roommate still seems unsatisfied.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to match those of other people or societal norms.

<step_3>
Based on the principle of conformity, both parties are at fault. The author and her boyfriend have not conformed to the roommate's cleanliness standards, which is causing discomfort for the roommate. On the other hand, the roommate agreed to live with them knowing about their tidiness habits and has not conformed to these habits. Instead, she has taken it upon herself to clean up, which is causing discomfort for the author and her boyfriend.

6. The author felt hurt and rejected by the guy's actions.
7. The guy tried to set the author up with his friend, which the author found insulting.
8. The guy is now trying to rekindle the friendship, but the author does not want to.
9. The author does not feel she owes the guy an explanation for her feelings.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity implies adhering to social norms and expectations.
2. The guy did not conform to the social expectation of following through on his promise to date the author.
3. The author is conforming to the social norm of distancing herself from a person who hurt her.
4. The guy's attempt to set the author up with his friend does not conform to the social norm of respecting the author's feelings.
5. The author's decision not to explain her feelings to the guy conforms to the social norm of not owing explanations to those who have hurt us.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The guy did not conform to the social expectation of following through on his promise, which led to the author feeling hurt and rejected. The author's decision to distance herself from the guy and not explain her feelings is in line with the social norm of protecting oneself from further emotional harm. Therefore, the author's actions are justified based on the principle of self-preservation and respect for her own feelings.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The girlfriend does not shave her pubic area but trims it occasionally.
2. The author is bothered by the hair when performing oral sex.
3. The girlfriend is diligent about shaving other parts of her body.
4. The author maintains a high level of personal grooming.
5. The author is considering asking his girlfriend to shave or trim her pubic hair.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this context refers to adhering to societal or personal standards of grooming. The girlfriend conforms to certain grooming standards (shaving legs and armpits), but not others (pubic hair). The author also conforms to a high standard of grooming. The author's desire for his girlfriend to change her grooming habits could be seen as a desire for her to conform to his personal standards.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it is not unethical for the author to express his preferences to his girlfriend. Communication is key in any relationship, and discussing personal grooming habits falls within this realm. However, it is important that the author approaches this conversation with sensitivity and respect, acknowledging that his girlfriend has autonomy over her body and her grooming habits. The girlfriend is also not at fault for her current grooming habits, as she is entitled to maintain her body as she sees fit.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author is not at fault for wanting to discuss his preferences, and the girlfriend is not at fault for her current grooming habits. The situation calls for open, respectful communication.

5. The father is also affected by the mother's behavior.
6. The author is worried about the influence of the mother's behavior on their younger sister.

<step_3>
The mother's obsession with the singing app and her subsequent behavior is causing distress within the family. Her actions are not conforming to the expected norms of family interaction and communication. The author's attempts to address the issue are met with resistance, further deviating from the value of conformity.

His parents are paying for his education. People care about him and want him to succeed. </step_1>

<step_2> These truths interact with the value of conformity in the following ways: The author is not conforming to the expectations of his parents, his peers, or society in general. He is not fulfilling his responsibilities or living up to his potential. He is also not conforming to his own standards, as he acknowledges that he is capable of more. </step_2>

<step_3> Based on these principles, it is clear that the author is not acting ethically. He is lying, not putting in effort, and not living up to his potential. He is also not respecting the investment his parents are making in his education. However, he is aware of his actions and their consequences, which suggests that he has the capacity to change. </step_3>

The final reasoning is that the author is at fault for his actions and their consequences. He is not acting ethically or responsibly, and is not living up to his potential. However, he has the capacity to change and should take responsibility for his actions.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author lives in the same town as their mother and has taken on the responsibility of caring for her.
2. The author's wife had a brain aneurysm 8 years ago and their daughter has depression issues, adding to the author's stress.
3. The author's siblings live in different locations and have not offered help or support.
4. The author sent an angry email to their siblings expressing frustration at their lack of involvement.
5. The siblings are now upset with the author.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' suggests that individuals should adhere to societal norms and expectations. In this case, it could be interpreted as the expectation that family members should support each other in times of need. The siblings' lack of involvement in their mother's care and their lack of support for the author contradicts this value.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it can be concluded that the siblings are not conforming to the societal expectation of family support. The author, despite their own stress and responsibilities, has taken on the care of their mother. The siblings, despite having more resources and less daily stress, have not offered help or support. The author's frustration and subsequent angry email can be seen as a reaction to this lack of conformity.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that the siblings' lack of involvement and support contradicts the societal expectation of family support, leading to the author's frustration and the conflict.

2. They are practicing Catholics and are against contraception and abortion.
3. Their first child has Tay Sach’s disease.
4. They are expecting another child with a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.
5. The author is considering suggesting an abortion or vasectomy to his brother.
6. The author is concerned about the potential financial and emotional burden on the family.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this context refers to adhering to societal or group norms. In this case, the norms are defined by the religious beliefs of the brother and his wife, which are against contraception and abortion. The author's suggestion of abortion or vasectomy goes against these norms. However, the author's concern about the potential suffering of another child and the financial and emotional burden on the family aligns with societal norms of preventing harm and ensuring well-being.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, the author's suggestion of abortion or vasectomy, while conflicting with the religious beliefs of the brother and his wife, is motivated by a desire to prevent potential suffering and financial and emotional burden. However, it is ultimately the decision of the brother and his wife, as they are the ones directly involved and affected by the situation. The author can express his concerns and provide information, but should respect their decision.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's intention to suggest abortion or vasectomy is driven by concern for the potential suffering of another child and the financial and emotional burden on the family. However, this suggestion conflicts with the religious beliefs of the brother and his wife. The author can express his concerns and provide information, but the final decision lies with the brother and his wife.

1. The author invited his friend over to his house to play on his Xbox.
2. The author made jokes about his friend being poor.
3. The author usually makes such jokes when he knows the other person understands it's a joke.
4. The friend was upset by the jokes and cried.
5. The friend's mother called the author's grandmother to inform her about the incident.
6. The author feels bad about the situation.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to coincide with a group standard.
2. The author's behavior of making jokes about his friend's financial status does not conform to generally accepted social norms, which discourage making fun of someone's personal circumstances.
3. The friend's reaction indicates that he did not accept or understand the joke, suggesting a lack of conformity in the author's behavior with his friend's expectations or comfort level.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's behavior of making jokes about his friend's financial status, despite knowing that such jokes could potentially be hurtful, is not in line with the value of conformity. The friend's reaction of being upset and crying further confirms that the author's behavior was not in line with his friend's expectations or comfort level. Therefore, the author is at fault for not conforming to generally accepted social norms and for not considering his friend's feelings before making the jokes.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and their best friend are fans of the band 21 Pilots.
2. The best friend was participating in an Instagram live wearing a green bandana with an abortion symbol, which is a symbol of protest for legalizing abortion in their country.
3. The author made a comment referring to the bandana as ""a killerbaby bandito"", a reference to the band 21 Pilots.
4. The best friend was upset by this comment and blocked the author on Instagram.
5. The author attempted to apologize but was told to stop talking to the best friend.
6. The author is unsure of what they did wrong and wants to mend the relationship.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms. The author's comment, while intended as a joke, did not conform to the seriousness of the abortion protest symbol on the bandana. The best friend's reaction indicates that she expected the author to conform to the seriousness of the issue at hand, rather than making light of it with a band reference.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it seems that the author made a comment that was perceived as insensitive or inappropriate given the context. While the author may not have intended to offend, their comment did not conform to the expected norms of the situation, leading to conflict. The best friend's reaction, while perhaps harsh, was a response to this perceived insensitivity.

The logical conclusion is that the author, while not intending to offend, made a comment that was inappropriate in the context, leading to a breakdown in communication and a damaged relationship.

3. The author is concerned about the potential risks and drama that could come with allowing the friend to live in their home.
4. The author has offered to pay for the friend's rent for a month or two as a compromise.
5. The wife views this as selfish and not enough help.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics.
2. The author's wife is conforming to the norm of helping a friend in need.
3. The author is not conforming to this norm, instead prioritizing the safety and stability of his own family.
4. The friend is not conforming to societal norms due to her involvement with drugs and potential criminal activity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author is not being selfish but rather protective of his family and their well-being. His compromise of paying for the friend's rent is a generous offer that allows him to help without putting his family at risk. The wife's desire to help is commendable, but her approach may not consider the potential negative consequences. The friend's actions and choices have led her to her current situation, and while help is needed, it should not come at the expense of others' safety and peace of mind.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author is not at fault for prioritizing his family's safety and offering a reasonable compromise to help his wife's friend. The wife's insistence on helping without considering the potential risks is not in line with the value of conformity, as it could disrupt the stability of their family. The friend's non-conformity to societal norms has led to her current predicament.

5. The author feels insulted and unappreciated by the small bonus.
6. The author is questioning whether their feelings of entitlement are justified.

These truths interact with the value of Conformity in the following ways:
1. The author conforms to the group's general ideology (feminism), but not to their specific behavior (expressing negative sentiments about men).
2. The friends conform to a common behavior within the group, but this behavior is causing discomfort to the author.
3. The friend's dismissal of the author's feelings enforces conformity at the expense of individual comfort and respect.

2. The other couple has repeatedly made jokes about all of them hooking up, which has made the author and their SO uncomfortable.
3. The other couple has now sent a text message suggesting they play sexual games and involve alcohol, which has further increased the author and their SO's discomfort.
4. The author and their SO are considering ignoring the other couple due to this discomfort.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' suggests adhering to social norms or expectations. In this scenario, the other couple's behavior deviates from the norm of respecting boundaries in a friendship. The author and their SO's reaction of discomfort aligns with the value of conformity, as they are responding to behavior that is outside of their accepted social norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of respect for personal boundaries and the value of conformity, the author and their SO are justified in feeling uncomfortable and considering distancing themselves from the other couple. Ignoring the other couple may not be the most effective solution, as it doesn't address the issue directly. A more principled approach would be to communicate their discomfort and establish clear boundaries.

The author's suggestion goes against the value of conformity, but it is a practical solution given their financial situation. The wife's insistence on conformity to her current job, despite the financial struggles, is understandable given her health and anxiety issues but may not be the most practical solution.

3. Medical tests have shown that she does not have an actual allergy.
4. The author made a snide comment about her dietary restrictions.
5. The mother's dietary restrictions have made family dinners difficult.

</step_2>

<step_3>

4. The partner reacted negatively to the author's expression of discomfort, accusing the author of being a jerk.
5. The author has expressed that she doesn't expect her partner to perform any sexual acts that make her uncomfortable.
</step_1>

<step_2>

However, this value also implies that the partner should respect the author's boundaries and not pressure her into doing something she is uncomfortable with.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of 'Conformity', it is clear that both parties have a responsibility to respect each other's boundaries and comfort levels. The author did the right thing by communicating her discomfort to her partner, and the partner should have respected this. The partner's reaction, accusing the author of being a jerk, is not in line with the value of 'Conformity' as it does not respect the author's boundaries. Therefore, the partner is at fault for not respecting the author's boundaries and for reacting negatively to the author's expression of discomfort.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author communicated her discomfort about a sexual act to her partner, which is a healthy and necessary part of any relationship.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author has a deep emotional connection to dogs, viewing them as companions rather than food.
2. The boyfriend knowingly ate dog meat while abroad in China, viewing it as a cultural experience.
3. The boyfriend's action deeply upset the author, causing her to reconsider their relationship.
4. The boyfriend does not see his action as a big deal and views it as a cultural difference.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario can be seen in the cultural norms and expectations around what is considered acceptable food. In the author's culture, eating dogs is seen as abhorrent, while in some parts of China, it is accepted. The boyfriend's action of eating dog meat goes against the author's cultural norms and personal values, causing a conflict.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it is clear that the author and her boyfriend have a significant difference in their cultural perspectives and personal values. The boyfriend's action of eating dog meat, while acceptable in the culture he was visiting, goes against the author's deeply held beliefs about the treatment of dogs. This has caused a rift in their relationship that may be difficult to mend. However, it is also important to note that the boyfriend did not intentionally harm a dog or support the cruel treatment of animals, but rather participated in a cultural practice during his travels.

Step 4: The boyfriend's action of eating dog meat, while culturally acceptable in the context, goes against the author's deeply held beliefs and cultural norms.

2. They engaged in unprotected sex, leading to a pregnancy that ended in miscarriage.
3. The author's parents disowned her due to this incident.
4. The author broke up with the guy because she felt he was insensitive after their sexual encounter.
5. The author told the guy she only sees him as a friend.
6. The guy has moved on and started dating someone else, which the author dislikes.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' refers to the adherence to social norms or standards. In this scenario, several actions deviate from societal norms, such as underage smoking, unprotected sex, and the author's parents' abusive reaction to her pregnancy. The author's decision to break up with the guy for his insensitivity also goes against the norm of open communication in a relationship. The guy's decision to move on and date someone else conforms to the societal norm of seeking a romantic relationship where feelings are reciprocated.
</step_2>

Based on these principles, the author is at fault for not communicating her feelings and reasons for breaking up with the guy. She also contradicts herself by saying she only sees him as a friend but then gets upset when he moves on. The guy is also at fault for not being more considerate after their sexual encounter. The parents are at fault for their abusive reaction. However, the guy's decision to move on is not at fault as it aligns with the value of conformity.

3. However, societal norms also encourage self-care and prioritizing one's own mental health.
4. The author's situation presents a conflict between these two societal expectations.
</step_2>

<step_3>
1. The author has a responsibility to their own mental health, especially given their history of mental health issues.
2. While supporting a friend in crisis is important, it should not come at the expense of one's own mental health.

Based on the principle of conformity, both the author and her boyfriend are not conforming to each other's views on what constitutes a work expense. The author sees the heels as a necessary work expense, while the boyfriend sees them as a luxury. Conversely, the boyfriend sees his weed expenditure as a necessary work expense, while the author may see it as a luxury. This discrepancy in views is causing conflict.

113,"So my friend (26F) and her boyfriend(26M) are very close to adopting a young husky (roughly 3yrs of age, male) and I’m trying to decide how honest I should be when talking to her about this because I ...",Other,Everybody,0.8,0.5,False,"<step_1>
The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The friend and her boyfriend are planning to adopt a young husky.
2. They already have an older, small dog who is not well-behaved and has anxiety.
3. The friend and her boyfriend have long work hours and are often not home.
4. The author believes that the adoption would be unfair to both dogs.
5. The author has tried to express their concerns but was met with a defensive response.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario could be interpreted as the friend and her boyfriend conforming to societal norms of pet ownership, i.e., adopting a pet because they want to or because it's a common thing to do. However, their current circumstances (long work hours, an older dog with anxiety) may not conform to the ideal conditions for adopting a new, young, and active dog like a husky.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it seems that the friend and her boyfriend may not be considering the full implications of their decision to adopt the husky. While they may have good intentions, their current circumstances may not be conducive to the well-being of the new dog, and could potentially exacerbate the anxiety of their older dog. The author's concerns seem valid, but their approach in expressing these concerns may need to be more tactful to avoid defensive reactions.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's concerns about the potential adoption are valid, considering the circumstances of the friend and her boyfriend. However, the way these concerns are communicated could be improved to avoid defensive reactions and promote a more open discussion about the potential implications of the adoption.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and her ex-boyfriend had a child together when they were 16.
2. The author and her ex-boyfriend broke up due to long distance and the author's infidelity.
3. The author has had two more children with a new partner.
4. The author is a stay-at-home mom and is struggling financially.
5. The author's ex-boyfriend is graduating and moving onto a full-time job.
6. The author is considering asking her ex-boyfriend for more child support.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' refers to the adherence to social norms and expectations. In this scenario, the author's actions of having children at a young age, infidelity, and reliance on child support do not conform to societal norms. The ex-boyfriend's actions of pursuing education and a career, however, do conform to societal norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's actions have led to her current financial struggles. While it is reasonable for her to seek more child support from her ex-boyfriend due to his increased income, it is not ethical to use this money to support her other children who are not his responsibility. The ex-boyfriend, on the other hand, has conformed to societal norms by pursuing education and a career, and his responsibility lies primarily with his own child.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's actions have led to her current financial struggles, and while it is reasonable for her to seek more child support from her ex-boyfriend due to his increased income, it is not ethical to use this money to support her other children who are not his responsibility. The ex-boyfriend has conformed to societal norms and his responsibility lies primarily with his own child.

1. The author, a 25-year-old, made a joke about a 16-year-old being legal in certain countries and made a BDSM joke.
2. The 16-year-old expressed discomfort with the joke.
3. The author switched topics but continued with dark humor.
4. The 16-year-old and others messaged the author's fiance, causing a fight between the author and their fiance.
5. The author told the 16-year-old to message them directly if there were any issues in the future.
6. The 16-year-old taunted the author, leading the author to insult him.
7. The 16-year-old called the author an A-hole and is trying to get others to agree.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The author did not conform to the social norms of respecting the comfort levels of others, especially considering the age difference.
2. The 16-year-old did not conform to the norm of direct communication when he had an issue with the author.
3. The author's reaction to the taunting did not conform to the norms of respectful communication.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author, despite being older and presumably more mature, made inappropriate jokes to a minor, which is ethically wrong. The 16-year-old's reaction, while not ideal, was a response to the author's inappropriate behavior. The author's subsequent insult to the 16-year-old was also inappropriate and not in line with the value of conformity to respectful communication norms.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author is in a busy downtown neighborhood with his wife.
2. A man from a halfway house approaches the author asking for help.
3. The man from the halfway house tells a long story before stating his need for change for the laundromat.
4. The author cuts the man off, asks him directly what he wants, and then denies his request due to lack of cash.
5. The man from the halfway house reacts indignantly to the author's response.
6. The author is annoyed by panhandlers who tell long stories before stating their needs.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' refers to the adherence to social norms and expectations. In this scenario:
1. The author conforms to the social norm of engaging with a stranger who approaches him in public.
2. The man from the halfway house does not conform to the social norm of directly stating his need, instead choosing to tell a long story.
3. The author's reaction to the man's story and request does not conform to the social norm of patience and understanding.
4. The man from the halfway house's indignant reaction does not conform to the social norm of accepting a negative response graciously.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that:
1. The author, while initially conforming to social norms, deviates from them by reacting impatiently and dismissively to the man's story and request.
2. The man from the halfway house, while in a difficult situation, deviates from social norms by not stating his need directly and reacting indignantly to the author's response.
3. Both parties have failed to fully adhere to the value of 'Conformity' in their interactions.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The final reasoning is that both the author and the man from the halfway house have failed to fully conform to social norms in their interaction. The author reacted impatiently and dismissively, while the man from the halfway house did not state his need directly and reacted indignantly to the author's response.

1. The author's sister is 18 and legally an adult.
2. The sister is in a relationship with a significantly older man (43M).
3. The author is concerned about this relationship due to the age gap and her sister's inexperience.
4. The author has requested to meet the man but has been denied.
5. The author has threatened to not allow her sister to continue the relationship unless she can meet the man.
6. The author acknowledges her sister's autonomy but also has strong negative opinions about the man.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics.
2. The author's actions do not conform to the societal norm of respecting an adult's autonomy in choosing their relationships.
3. The sister's relationship with an older man does not conform to societal norms due to the significant age gap.
4. The man's refusal to meet the author does not conform to the societal norm of openness in relationships, especially with family members.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author, while not conforming to the societal norm of respecting an adult's autonomy, is acting out of concern for her sister's safety and well-being. The sister's relationship with the older man, which also does not conform to societal norms, raises valid concerns due to the significant age gap and the sister's inexperience. The man's refusal to meet the author further raises concerns about his intentions. Therefore, while the author's actions may not conform to societal norms, they are justified given the circumstances.

1. The author and his brother share a Nintendo Switch, which was a gift.
2. The author bought a Pro Controller with his own money.
3. The brother wants to use the Pro Controller but the author is reluctant due to past experiences of the brother's carelessness.
4. The author uses the brother's headphones with permission.
5. The parents insist that the author should share the Pro Controller.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity implies adhering to social norms or rules. In this case, it would mean sharing resources in a family setting.
2. The author's decision to not share the Pro Controller conflicts with the value of conformity.
3. The parents' insistence on sharing aligns with the value of conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's reluctance to share the Pro Controller, which he bought with his own money, is justified due to past experiences of his brother's carelessness. However, this conflicts with the value of conformity, which in this context implies sharing resources within a family. The parents' insistence on sharing aligns with this value. Therefore, the conflict arises from the differing interpretations of the value of conformity.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's decision to not share the Pro Controller, bought with his own money, is justified due to his brother's past carelessness. However, this decision conflicts with the family norm of sharing resources, which is being enforced by the parents. The conflict arises from differing interpretations of the value of conformity.

Only thi...",Everybody,Everybody,0.8,0.4117647058823529,False,"<step_1>
The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The husband needs help with a car repair negotiation.
2. The wife is skilled at such negotiations and could potentially get a significant discount.
3. The wife feels unappreciated due to the husband's lack of effort in celebrating special occasions.
4. The wife has previously gone out of her way to do nice things for the husband.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which implies adhering to social norms or expectations. In this context, it could refer to the expectation within a relationship for mutual support and appreciation. The wife's feelings of being unappreciated conflict with this value, as does the husband's lack of effort in celebrating special occasions. However, the wife's consideration of not helping with the negotiation also conflicts with the value of conformity, as it goes against the expectation of mutual support in a relationship.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that both parties are at fault to some extent. The husband for not showing appreciation and not putting effort into celebrating special occasions, and the wife for considering not helping with the negotiation as a form of retaliation. Both actions go against the value of conformity in terms of mutual support and appreciation in a relationship.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that both parties are not adhering to the value of conformity in terms of mutual support and appreciation in a relationship. The husband is not showing appreciation or putting effort into special occasions, and the wife is considering not helping with a situation where she could be of significant assistance.

   So my Brother and I both play xbox and buy games with our own money. I treat my games as if they are the item that would save the world (they are expensive)....",Other,Other,0.9,1.0,True,"<step_1>
The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and his brother both play Xbox and buy games with their own money.
2. The author treats his games with care because they are expensive.
3. The author's brother does not treat his own or the author's games with care, often leaving them on the floor and allowing them to get scratched.
4. The author wants to buy a new game but is hesitant to let his brother play it for fear of it getting damaged.
5. The author's brother enjoys playing the games that the author buys.
6. The author is worried that his parents will get involved if he doesn't let his brother play his games.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario would suggest that the author should follow the established norm or rule in their household regarding the sharing and treatment of games. However, it appears that there is a lack of conformity in the way the author and his brother treat their games. The author values and respects his possessions, while his brother does not. 
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is not wrong for wanting to protect his possessions from damage. It is reasonable to expect that items bought with personal money should be treated with respect. The brother's lack of care for the games, both his own and the author's, is not in line with the value of conformity, as it goes against the norm of respecting personal property. If the parents get involved, it would be beneficial to explain the situation and the reasons for not wanting to share the new game.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author is justified in his concern about his brother's treatment of his games. The brother's disregard for the care of the games is not in line with the value of conformity, which suggests respecting personal property. The author should communicate his concerns to his brother and parents if necessary.

2. The abuser was severely mentally ill at the time of the abuse.
3. The abuser has since sought therapy and appears to have changed.
4. The author believes there may be romantic possibilities with the abuser.
5. The author is aware that this could be detrimental to the victim, who is also a close friend.
6. The author is trying to keep this potential relationship a secret from the victim.
7. The victim's boyfriend, who is also the author's friend, knows about the potential relationship.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms.
2. The author's actions are not conforming to the norms of friendship, which typically involve trust, honesty, and consideration for the other's feelings.
3. The author's intention to keep the relationship a secret from the victim goes against the norms of transparency and honesty in relationships.
4. The author's potential romantic involvement with the abuser could be seen as non-conformity to societal norms, which generally condemn relationships with individuals who have committed serious offenses, regardless of their current state.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of conformity, the author's actions are not in line with the norms of friendship and societal expectations. The author is aware of the potential harm this relationship could cause to the victim, yet is still considering pursuing it. Furthermore, the intention to keep this relationship a secret from the victim is a breach of trust and honesty, which are fundamental to any relationship. Therefore, the author's actions are not conforming to the expected norms.

The author is at fault for considering a relationship with the abuser and intending to keep it a secret from the victim, despite being aware of the potential harm it could cause. This goes against the norms of friendship and societal expectations.

The author is under significant stress due to finals and other academic responsibilities. The author is also on a diet and has specific dietary needs. The author's mother asked the author to cook more food for the family, but the author declined due to lack of energy and not wanting to eat the same meal twice. The mother accused the author of being negative and cruel, which upset the author.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of conformity suggests that individuals should adhere to societal or familial norms and expectations. In this scenario, the expectation might be that the author should help with household chores, including cooking for the family. However, the author's current circumstances (academic stress, dietary needs) make it difficult for them to conform to this expectation.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's refusal to cook more food for the family is not inherently cruel or abusive. It seems to be a reaction to their current circumstances and personal needs. The mother's reaction, labeling the author as negative and cruel, seems to be an overreaction. However, the author could have communicated their situation and feelings more effectively to avoid misunderstanding.

3. The girlfriend's behavior conforms to the norms of the fan community she is part of, which includes expressing enthusiasm for characters and reading fanfiction.

The girlfriend's behavior is not conforming to the boyfriend's expectations, but it is conforming to the norms of her fan community.

5. The girlfriend is upset and feels as though the author is taking something away from her.
6. The girlfriend believes that the author should sacrifice his comfort for her enjoyment.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests that individuals should adhere to societal norms or established practices within a group.
2. In this scenario, the established practice within the relationship was that the girlfriend was allowed to pop the author's pimples.
3. The author's decision to stop this practice goes against the established norm within the relationship.
</step_2>

<step_3>
However, the principle of personal autonomy and respect for individual boundaries supersedes the value of conformity in this context. The author has the right to decide what happens to his body, especially when it involves pain and discomfort. The girlfriend's insistence on continuing a practice that causes the author discomfort is not ethically justified, even if it was an established norm in their relationship.

The author is not at fault for asserting his personal boundaries and prioritizing his physical comfort over the established norm in the relationship.

2. The author's wife is a stay-at-home mom.
3. Their son stays with his grandparents for about one week each month.
4. The wife does not do much housework.
5. The author refuses to do housework because he believes it's his wife's responsibility.

However, the wife does not conform to this expectation as she does not do much housework.

Based on these principles, it can be concluded that the author is not necessarily an ""asshole"" for expecting his wife to do the housework, as this expectation is based on their agreed-upon roles. However, it is also clear that the wife is not fulfilling her part of the agreement, which is causing tension.

The author's actions do not conform to the expectations of his wife, which is causing tension. However, it is important to note that conformity is not always the best course of action, especially when it comes to personal growth and mental health.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and his girlfriend have been dating for six months.
2. The author rarely posts on his main account and has not posted a picture of them together.
3. The girlfriend posted about the author on his birthday, which he appreciated but didn't find necessary.
4. The author posted a birthday message for his girlfriend on his Instagram story.
5. The girlfriend confronted the author about not posting a picture of them together.

7. The girlfriend became upset, called the author inconsiderate, and said she no longer wants to take pictures with him.
8. The girlfriend removed the post of her and the author.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of conformity refers to the adherence to social norms or expectations. In this scenario, the girlfriend seems to value conformity in the sense that she expects the author to post a picture of them together on his main account, which is a common practice in relationships. The author, on the other hand, does not conform to this expectation due to his personal beliefs and preferences about social media posting.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is not ethically wrong for not conforming to the social norm of posting pictures with a significant other on social media. His reasons are personal and not intended to harm or disrespect his girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's reaction indicates that she feels hurt and unappreciated, suggesting a lack of understanding or communication between the two about their expectations and values related to social media use in their relationship. 
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's decision not to post a picture of them together on his main account is not ethically wrong, but it has caused a misunderstanding and hurt feelings in his relationship due to differing expectations and values about social media use. Both parties could benefit from better communication and understanding of each other's perspectives.

6. The ex-boyfriend gets angry when the author disagrees with him and accuses her of not loving him.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to coincide with a group standard. In this case, the standard could be the societal expectation that partners living together should share financial responsibilities.
2. The author is conforming to this standard by expecting her ex-boyfriend to contribute to rent or household chores.
3. The ex-boyfriend is not conforming to this standard, as he is unable to contribute financially and unwilling to contribute through housework.

<step_3>
Based on the principle of conformity, the author is acting in line with societal expectations by expecting her ex-boyfriend to contribute to the household. The ex-boyfriend, however, is not conforming to these expectations. His inability to contribute financially is understandable given his debt, but his unwillingness to contribute through housework is not in line with the principle of sharing responsibilities in a cohabitation situation. His reaction to the author's disagreement also raises concerns about their communication and conflict resolution skills.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author is in their mid-twenties and feels a lack of purpose in life.
2. The author came across a mentally challenged girl who had run away from home.
3. The author helped the girl hide, not for her benefit, but to give themselves a sense of purpose.
4. This action led to trouble with the police and caused problems for a friend and the friend's boss's daughter.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which implies adhering to societal norms and rules. In this scenario, the author's actions of helping the girl hide, especially when it was not for her benefit, goes against the societal norm of reporting a missing person to the authorities. This action also led to trouble with the law, further indicating non-conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's actions were not in line with the value of conformity. They acted against societal norms and legal requirements by aiding a vulnerable person to hide instead of reporting her to the authorities. This action was not for the girl's benefit but for the author's sense of purpose, which further deviates from the principle of acting in the best interest of others, especially those who are vulnerable.

3. The author is not conforming to the parents' expectations of finding a roommate.
4. The author is conforming to a personal norm of prioritizing mental health and wellbeing.

4. The author yells at the dogs and crates them when they are caught, sometimes overnight, until they can be bathed.
5. The author believes the dogs know they are doing something wrong because they hide their actions.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting behaviors to align with the norms or standards of the group.
2. The dogs are not conforming to the author's desired behaviors (not digging in the mud, not chewing blankets, not pooping by the door).

7. A neighbor found the author's presence unusual and questioned him.
8. The author explained his situation to the neighbor.

These truths interact with the value of 'Conformity' in the following ways:
1. The author's late-night walks and smoking habit do not conform to typical suburban behavior.
2. The author's casual attire may not conform to the expected appearance in a suburban setting.
3. The author's awareness of potential discomfort and his responsible disposal of cigarette butts show a desire to conform to social norms of respect and environmental responsibility.
4. The author's reaction to a potentially dangerous situation shows a desire to conform to norms of self-preservation.
5. The neighbor's questioning of the author's behavior shows an expectation of conformity to typical suburban behavior.

Based on these principles, the author's behavior does not fully conform to typical suburban norms, particularly in terms of his late-night walks and smoking habit. However, he shows a desire to conform to social norms of respect and environmental responsibility. The neighbor's questioning of the author's behavior indicates an expectation of conformity, but it does not necessarily mean the author is at fault for not fully conforming.

4. The girlfriend expressed disappointment and sadness over not catching a shiny Bulbasaur, and felt the author was rubbing it in by celebrating his own catches.
5. The girlfriend had previously stated she would give the author her shiny Gengar if he didn't catch one, and was upset that he wouldn't do the same with his second Bulbasaur.
6. The author did not want to give up his second Bulbasaur and was annoyed by his girlfriend's reaction.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of conformity in this scenario can be seen in the girlfriend's expectation that the author would reciprocate her willingness to share a prized Pokemon. The author, however, does not conform to this expectation, choosing to keep his second Bulbasaur for his own collection.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, the author is not obligated to give up his second Bulbasaur, as it is his to do with as he pleases. However, his refusal to do so, despite knowing how much it would mean to his girlfriend, could be seen as a lack of empathy or consideration for her feelings. His annoyance at her reaction also suggests a lack of understanding or respect for her emotional investment in the game. On the other hand, the girlfriend's expectation that the author should give up his second Bulbasaur could be seen as an imposition on his autonomy and enjoyment of the game.
</step_3>

<step_4>
In conclusion, while the author is not obligated to give up his second Bulbasaur, his lack of empathy and understanding towards his girlfriend's feelings could be seen as a failure to conform to the norms of a caring and considerate relationship. The girlfriend's expectation that the author should give up his second Bulbasaur, however, could also be seen as an imposition on his autonomy and enjoyment of the game.

1. The author's girlfriend revealed that she signed up for sugar baby websites before they met.
2. The author's girlfriend needed money for travel.
3. The author's girlfriend claims she never sent any photos to the men who messaged her.
4. The author questioned his girlfriend's self-respect, causing an argument.
5. The author apologized for his initial reaction but still harbors doubts and lost respect for his girlfriend.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The author's girlfriend's actions of signing up for sugar baby websites deviate from societal norms, challenging the value of conformity.
2. The author's reaction of questioning his girlfriend's self-respect aligns with societal norms, reinforcing the value of conformity.
3. The author's continued doubts and loss of respect for his girlfriend indicate a struggle with the deviation from conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's girlfriend's past actions deviate from societal norms, causing the author discomfort and leading to a loss of respect. The author's reaction, while initially harsh, was followed by an apology, indicating an attempt to reconcile the situation. However, the author's continued doubts suggest a struggle with accepting his girlfriend's past actions that deviate from societal norms.
</step_3>

The author's struggle with his girlfriend's past actions that deviate from societal norms is understandable, but it's important to remember that everyone has a past and people can change. The author's girlfriend was honest about her past, which is a positive sign. However, the author's doubts and loss of respect could potentially harm their relationship if not addressed.

Only problem is that everyone living in the house...",Author,Other,0.9,0.5,False,"<step_1>
The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The sister wants to host a family potluck at her house.
2. The author is willing to participate and contribute to the potluck.
3. The house, according to the author, is extremely messy and unhygienic.
4. The author is embarrassed to bring his girlfriend to his family's house due to its condition.
5. The author wants to ask his sister to clean the house before the family visit.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms. In this scenario, the sister's household does not conform to the generally accepted norms of cleanliness and hygiene. The author, on the other hand, seems to conform to these norms and is uncomfortable with the state of the house.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, it is not unreasonable for the author to request a clean environment for a family gathering, especially when food is involved. This is a basic expectation in most societies and aligns with the value of conformity. However, the author should approach the subject with sensitivity, understanding that his sister may have different standards or may be overwhelmed with the responsibilities of a large household.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The author's request for a clean environment for the family gathering is not unreasonable and aligns with the value of conformity to societal norms of cleanliness and hygiene. However, the approach should be sensitive and understanding of the sister's circumstances.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author has chosen to limit contact with their older brother due to his substance abuse and alcoholism.
2. The brother's girlfriend consistently behaves rudely towards the author and their parents.
3. The author has chosen to not engage with the girlfriend due to her behavior.
4. The parents tolerate the girlfriend's behavior out of fear of the brother's potential self-destructive reaction.
5. The brother accuses the author of being unwelcoming towards his girlfriend.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario would suggest that the author should follow the norms of politeness and hospitality towards the brother's girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's behavior is disrespectful and violates the norms of behavior in someone else's home. The author's response of non-engagement is a deviation from the norm, but it is a reaction to the girlfriend's non-conformity to basic etiquette.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is not at fault for choosing to not engage with the girlfriend due to her disrespectful behavior. The brother's accusation of the author being unwelcoming is not justified, as it is the girlfriend's behavior that is causing the tension. The parents' fear of the brother's potential reaction is understandable but it enables the girlfriend's disrespectful behavior. 
</step_3>

The logical conclusion is that the author is not at fault for choosing to not engage with the girlfriend due to her disrespectful behavior. The brother's accusation is not justified, and the parents' fear is enabling the girlfriend's behavior.

4. The mother felt the author was obligated to help and reacted with passive aggression.
5. The author eventually helped but was visibly upset and unhappy.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of 'Conformity' suggests adhering to a certain behavior or action that is generally accepted or expected.
2. The mother expected the author to conform to the family tradition of decorating the house.
3. The author, however, did not conform due to personal emotional discomfort associated with the act.
</step_2>

<step_3>
1. The author's refusal to conform to the expectation of decorating the house is based on their personal emotional discomfort, which is a valid reason.
2. The mother's expectation for the author to conform, despite knowing their discomfort, can be seen as insensitive.
3. However, the author's visible unhappiness while decorating could have been handled better to avoid further conflict.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's refusal to conform to the act of decorating was based on their personal emotional discomfort, which is valid.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author's older sister has a history of bullying and degrading the author.
2. The older sister returned home without prior warning and continued her negative behavior.
3. The author tried to ignore the older sister's provocations.
4. The older sister physically attacked the author, who then restrained her.
5. The author yelled at the older sister to leave or die.
6. The father sided with the older sister and blamed the author.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of conformity suggests that individuals should adhere to societal norms and rules. In this scenario:
1. The older sister's bullying behavior is a clear violation of societal norms.
2. The author's response to ignore and later restrain the older sister aligns with societal expectations of self-defense.
3. The author's statement telling the older sister to die or leave is a violation of societal norms of respect and non-violence.
4. The father's reaction, blaming the author without considering the older sister's actions, is a violation of fairness, a societal norm.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the older sister's bullying and physical attack are clear violations of societal norms and the value of conformity. The author's response, while provoked, also violated societal norms when he told his sister to die. The father's reaction, blaming the author without considering the older sister's actions, is also a violation of societal norms of fairness. Therefore, all parties involved have violated the value of conformity to some extent.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that all parties involved have violated societal norms and the value of conformity. The older sister through her bullying and physical attack, the author through his harsh words, and the father through his unfair blame.

1. The author has moved to the States and is currently unable to work legally.
2. The author is using this time to engage in hobbies, volunteering, and house decoration.

4. The SIL has been frequently asking the author to babysit her children, often with little notice.
5. The author does not enjoy babysitting and feels it is draining.
6. The author has communicated her unwillingness to babysit regularly to the SIL and the family.
7. The family perceives the author as lazy and unhelpful.
8. The author feels bad for causing tension within the family but has her husband's support.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of 'Conformity' suggests adhering to social norms or expectations.
2. The family's expectation is for the author to help out by babysitting.
3. The author is not conforming to this expectation, choosing instead to prioritize her own needs and interests.
4. The author's decision is causing tension within the family, indicating a conflict with the value of conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author is not obligated to conform to the family's expectations if it compromises her well-being and personal interests. While it is commendable to help family, it should not be at the expense of one's own needs. The family's perception of the author as lazy is based on their expectations, not on an objective evaluation of the author's actions and circumstances. The author has communicated her position clearly and has the support of her husband, which is crucial in this family dynamic.

3. The ex-girlfriend threatened self-harm and suicide to get the author's attention.
4. The author tried to distance himself from the ex-girlfriend for his own mental health.
5. The ex-girlfriend later revealed that she was forced into the act she initially described as cheating.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting behaviors to align with the norms of a group or society.
2. The author's actions of breaking up, distancing himself, and encouraging professional help align with societal norms for dealing with manipulative and harmful behavior.
3. The ex-girlfriend's actions of manipulation, false accusations, and threats of self-harm deviate from societal norms.
4. The ex-girlfriend's later revelation of being forced into an act complicates the situation, but does not change the fact that her previous actions were manipulative and harmful.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author acted in a manner consistent with societal norms and his own mental health needs. The ex-girlfriend's manipulative behavior and threats of self-harm were harmful and deviated from societal norms. Her later revelation of being forced into an act she initially described as cheating does not absolve her of her previous harmful actions. The author could not have known this information earlier due to the ex-girlfriend's own false accusations.
</step_3>

The author acted in accordance with societal norms and prioritized his mental health in a difficult situation. The ex-girlfriend's manipulative and harmful behavior deviated from societal norms. Her later revelation does not absolve her of her previous actions. The author is not at fault for not knowing the full story earlier due to the ex-girlfriend's own false accusations.

2. The author wanted to plan something for her friend's birthday.
3. The friend told the author she was having dinner with her mom.
4. The friend's husband surprised her with a hotel room.
5. The author saw a picture of her friend with another friend on Instagram.
6. The friend claimed the picture was old.
7. The author felt hurt and confronted her friend.
8. The friend advised the author to ask before jumping to conclusions.
9. The author has a history of getting upset over similar situations.
10. The friend is not responding to the author's messages.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to coincide with a group standard.
2. The author's expectation of being included in her friend's birthday plans reflects a desire for conformity in their relationship.
3. The friend's actions, whether intentional or not, deviate from the author's expectations, challenging the conformity within their relationship.
4. The author's reaction to the Instagram picture and subsequent confrontation with her friend also deviates from the norm of conformity, as it creates conflict.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it seems that both the author and her friend have different expectations of their relationship. The author expects to be included in her friend's plans, while the friend may not see this as necessary. The author's reaction to the Instagram picture and subsequent confrontation with her friend deviates from the norm of conformity, creating conflict. The friend's advice to the author to ask before jumping to conclusions suggests that she values open communication, which could help maintain conformity in their relationship. However, the author's history of getting upset over similar situations indicates a pattern of behavior that may be contributing to the lack of conformity.
</step_3>

Step 4: The lack of conformity in this scenario stems from differing expectations and communication styles between the author and her friend. The author's expectation to be included in her friend's plans and her tendency to jump to conclusions when she feels excluded contribute to the conflict. On the other hand, the friend's lack of transparency and her decision not to respond to the author's messages also contribute to the lack of conformity.

The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics.

2. The husband has encouraged the wife to cook meals from her cultural background.
3. The wife does not know how to cook these meals as she was not taught by her family.
4. The husband suggested that she should embrace her culture more.
5. The wife responded that if the husband wanted such meals, he should cook them himself.
6. The husband feels he cannot cook these meals due to his own cultural background.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario can be seen in the husband's suggestion that the wife should cook meals from her cultural background, implying that she should conform to her cultural norms. However, the wife's response indicates a resistance to conform to this expectation, as she was not taught to cook these meals and does not feel obligated to learn.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that the husband's encouragement for the wife to embrace her culture more is not inherently wrong. However, his assumption that she should be able to cook meals from her cultural background because of her ethnicity, and his refusal to learn to cook these meals himself due to his own cultural background, can be seen as ethnocentric and unfair. The wife's resistance to conform to her husband's expectations is justified, as she should not be expected to conform to cultural norms she does not identify with or feel comfortable with.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The husband's encouragement for his wife to embrace her culture more is not wrong, but his assumption that she should be able to cook meals from her cultural background due to her ethnicity, and his refusal to learn to cook these meals himself due to his own cultural background, is ethnocentric and unfair.

5. The partner remained upset and distant, which frustrated the author.
6. The author is questioning whether her partner's reaction is genuine or a manipulation to maintain an unequal relationship dynamic.

<step_2>
1. The author values conformity, which in this context could mean adhering to the norms of respect, communication, and consent in a relationship.
2. The author has shown conformity by respecting her partner's boundaries, communicating openly about issues, and apologizing when she unintentionally crossed a boundary.
3. The partner's reaction, whether genuine or manipulative, challenges the author's value of conformity as it disrupts the norms of communication and understanding in their relationship.

The author has demonstrated respect for her partner's boundaries and feelings, and has shown remorse for unintentionally causing distress. However, the partner's continued upset and lack of communication is causing strain. If the partner's reaction is genuine, it's important for her to communicate her feelings and needs to the author.

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it is clear that the author's mother is enforcing a form of conformity that is not respectful of the author's individuality and personal boundaries. The author, on the other hand, is asserting their right to individuality and personal boundaries, which is a form of resistance to conformity. However, the author's resistance to conformity is justified given the mother's disregard for their feelings and experiences. Therefore, the mother's enforcement of conformity is not ethical in this context.

6. The author told the person about their situation and the person was not looking for anything specific either.
7. The author believes they don't owe anyone their full story right off the bat.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author is a 19-year-old male who shares a lot of interests with his father.
2. The father has a bad temper and is stubborn.
3. The author was feeling sick and decided not to go to school.
4. The father disagreed with the author's decision and called him lazy.
5. The author responded angrily, asserting his right to decide whether he's well enough to go to school.
6. The father escalated the situation by storming into the author's room, insulting him, and physically grabbing him by the throat.
7. The author responded by telling his father to ""shut up,"" which is considered harsh in Sweden.
8. The author ended up going to school to avoid being in the house.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario can be seen in the father's expectation that the author should go to school despite feeling sick. The father's reaction to the author's decision not to go to school suggests that he values obedience and conformity to his expectations. The author, on the other hand, values his autonomy and the right to make decisions about his own health.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of 'Conformity,' it can be concluded that both the author and his father are at fault. The author was disrespectful in his response to his father, which goes against the value of 'Conformity.' However, the father's reaction was excessive and physically aggressive, which is not justified regardless of the author's disrespect. Both parties failed to communicate effectively and escalated the situation unnecessarily.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author and his father both contributed to the escalation of the situation. The author's disrespect and the father's aggressive reaction both go against the value of 'Conformity.' They both failed to communicate effectively and respect each other's perspectives.

<step_3>
The girl's action of cutting in line was a clear violation of the accepted norms of queuing, which is a form of non-conformity. The author's refusal to lend her pen was a reaction to this non-conformity. While it may not conform to the expected polite behavior, it was a response to a clear violation of social norms. Therefore, the girl's non-conformity led to the author's response.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The grandparents stay over at the parents' house and often need to talk to the author.
2. The grandparents demand immediate attention, including when the author is changing clothes.
3. The author's bedroom door doesn't have a lock, allowing the grandparents to enter at any time.
4. The author has asked the grandparents to leave when they enter while the author is changing, but they refuse.
5. The author resorts to yelling to get the grandparents to leave during these instances.
6. The grandparents accuse the author of being disrespectful when asked to leave.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. 
1. The grandparents' insistence on immediate attention, regardless of the situation, could be seen as a demand for conformity to their expectations.
2. The author's reaction (yelling) is a non-conformist response to the grandparents' intrusion.
3. The grandparents' refusal to leave when asked could be seen as non-conformity to the author's personal boundaries.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that:
1. The grandparents are not respecting the author's personal boundaries, which is a violation of basic ethical norms.
2. The author's reaction, while not ideal, is a response to this violation.
3. The grandparents' demand for respect does not override the author's right to privacy and personal space.
4. The grandparents' behavior could be seen as an attempt to enforce conformity to their expectations, but this does not justify their disregard for the author's boundaries.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The grandparents are at fault for not respecting the author's personal boundaries and privacy. Their demand for respect and conformity does not justify their actions. The author's reaction, while not ideal, is a response to this violation. Therefore, the grandparents are at fault.

1. The family is preparing for a tropical trip and needs new swimsuits.
2. The sister, who is 14, chose three swimsuits, including two bikinis.
3. The author expressed discomfort with his sister wearing a bikini due to her age.
4. The author's discomfort is based on his belief that it's inappropriate for his sister to show that much skin.
5. The father's girlfriend accused the author of being sexist and body shaming.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity implies adhering to societal norms or standards.
2. The author's discomfort with his sister's attire could be seen as an attempt to conform to societal norms about age-appropriate clothing.
3. The father's girlfriend's reaction could be seen as a challenge to these norms, suggesting that they are sexist or body shaming.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's discomfort stems from his belief about what is age-appropriate attire, which aligns with the value of conformity. However, the father's girlfriend's reaction suggests that these norms may be sexist or body shaming. This disagreement indicates a clash of values and perspectives, rather than a clear-cut ethical violation.

Also I d...",Author,Author,0.9,0.68,False,"<step_1>
The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author does not throw away plastic or processed foods.
2. The author throws organic waste like orange peels and apple cores on some grass when driving.
3. The author does not throw anything out of the car on expressways.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value 'Conformity' refers to the adherence to social norms and laws. In this context, it would mean not littering, regardless of the type of waste. While the author does not throw away plastic or processed foods, they do throw organic waste out of the car, which is a form of littering and thus non-conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of conformity, the author's action of throwing organic waste out of the car is not conforming to the social norms and laws against littering. Even though organic waste is biodegradable, it is still considered littering when thrown out in public spaces. 
</step_3>

The author is at fault for not conforming to the social norms and laws against littering, even if the waste is organic and biodegradable.

1. The author and his girlfriend have been dating for four months.
2. The girlfriend has a past traumatic experience related to porn.
3. The girlfriend expressed her discomfort with porn and asked the author to stop using it.
4. The author agreed to stop using porn but continued to do so secretly.
5. The girlfriend found out about the author's continued use of porn and is now distant.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard or an agreed-upon expectation.
2. The author agreed to conform to his girlfriend's request to stop using porn but did not follow through.
3. The girlfriend expected the author to conform to the agreement they had about not using porn.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author agreed to stop using porn to conform to his girlfriend's request, which was based on her personal experiences and values. However, he did not follow through on this agreement, breaking the expectation of conformity. His actions led to a breach of trust, causing his girlfriend to distance herself. The author's belief that his actions did not impact their relationship does not change the fact that he broke an agreement and violated the principle of conformity.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author received an email notification about an Amazon order.
2. The author saw what the order was and deemed it expensive and unnecessary.
3. The author cancelled the order without consulting the person who made it.
4. The author is considering reshipping the order if they are deemed at fault.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which implies adhering to social norms or rules. In this case, the social norm would be to respect the decisions of others, especially when it comes to their personal purchases. The author's actions of cancelling the order without consulting the person who made it goes against this value.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's action of cancelling the order without consulting the person who made it is not in line with the value of conformity. It would have been more appropriate to discuss the matter with the person who made the order before taking any action. The author's consideration to reship the order if they are deemed at fault shows a willingness to rectify the situation, but it doesn't change the initial breach of conformity.
</step_3>

The author is at fault for not conforming to the social norm of respecting others' decisions, especially when it involves their personal purchases. The author should have discussed the matter with the person who made the order before cancelling it.

4. The author is considering asking others to use a different park section if they try to join while their dog is present.
5. The dog park has separate areas for different sizes of dogs and one for all sizes.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting behaviors to align with the norms or standards of the group.
2. The author's plan to use the park during off-peak hours aligns with the norm of sharing public spaces.
3. Asking others to use a different park section may not conform to the typical norms of shared public spaces.
4. However, the author's intention is to ensure the safety and well-being of their dog, which could be seen as conforming to responsible pet ownership norms.

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's intention to use the park during off-peak hours aligns with the norms of shared public spaces, which is in line with the value of conformity. However, asking others to use a different park section may not conform to the typical norms of shared public spaces. Yet, this action is driven by the author's responsibility towards their dog's well-being, which is also a form of conformity to the norms of responsible pet ownership.

1. The author borrowed his cousin's iPhone 7 Plus for diving.
2. The phone was lost due to a broken string on the waterproof bag.
3. The author agreed to replace the lost phone.
4. The cousin wants a more expensive replacement (iPhone X) and wants it immediately.
5. The cousin's parents want the author's parents to guarantee payment if the author fails to do so.
6. The author refuses to pay more than the current market value of the lost phone and refuses to involve his parents.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity implies adhering to social norms or expectations.
2. The social expectation in this scenario is that the author should replace the lost phone.
3. The cousin's demand for a more expensive phone and immediate replacement goes beyond the norm of replacing what was lost.
4. The author's refusal to pay more than the market value of the lost phone and not involve his parents aligns with the value of conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principle of replacing what was lost, the author is correct in offering to replace the iPhone 7 Plus with a similar model or its current market value. The cousin's demand for a more expensive phone and immediate replacement is not in line with the principle of replacing what was lost. The cousin's parents' demand for the author's parents to guarantee payment also goes beyond the principle of personal responsibility for one's actions.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author is adhering to the principle of replacing what was lost and not involving others unnecessarily, which aligns with the value of conformity. The cousin and her parents are making demands that go beyond this principle and value.

The author did not conform to the expectations set by his girlfriend, which caused conflict. However, the author's belief that his actions were not wrong is based on his past behavior of letting friends stay over.

3. The author is considering applying for the old position and may turn it down if offered the other internship.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics.
2. The author's actions of applying for multiple positions within the same company may not conform to typical job-seeking behavior, which usually involves applying for one position at a time within the same company.

Based on the principles of conformity, the author's actions could be seen as non-conforming if we consider the norm to be applying for one job at a time within the same company. However, if we consider the broader norm of seeking the best possible job opportunity, the author's actions could be seen as conforming. Therefore, whether the author's actions are ethical or not depends on which norm we consider to be more important.

</step_2>

<step_3>
The mother's comments are inappropriate and racially insensitive, which is not in line with societal norms of respect and sensitivity towards race and sexual orientation. The author and their brother are trying to help their mother understand why her comments are inappropriate and encourage her to conform to these norms. However, the mother is resistant to changing her behavior. This resistance to conformity is causing conflict and discomfort.

Based on the principle of conformity, the author would adjust their plans to align with the group's (the cousin's suggestion). However, considering the significant plans and sacrifices made by the author and her husband, it is also reasonable for them to insist on their original plan. The decision should balance the value of conformity with respect for individual plans and efforts.

1. The author's family members are anti-vaccination due to their religious beliefs and misinformation.
2. The author plans to vaccinate their future child.
3. The author does not want their future child to interact with unvaccinated family members until their child is fully vaccinated.
4. The author's parents believe this is an extreme measure and unnecessary since the child will be vaccinated.
5. The author is concerned about the potential harm to their child and the emotional impact on their family.
</step_1>

Step 2: Examine how these truths interact with the Value. Strictly provide your output between <step_2> and </step_2> tags.

<step_2>
The value in question is conformity. The author's family members conform to a belief system that rejects vaccinations. The author, however, does not conform to this belief and plans to vaccinate their future child. The author's decision to keep their child away from unvaccinated family members until fully vaccinated is a form of non-conformity to the family's belief system. The author's parents' view that this is unnecessary is a form of conformity to the belief that vaccinated individuals are protected and need not worry about unvaccinated individuals.
</step_2>

Step 3: Construct a logical conclusion based on principles rather than assumptions. Strictly provide your output between <step_3> and </step_3> tags.

<step_3>
The author is acting in the best interest of their future child's health, which is a fundamental responsibility of parenthood. This decision, while not conforming to the family's beliefs, is based on scientific evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of vaccines. The parents' belief that the vaccinated child should not worry about unvaccinated individuals overlooks the fact that vaccines are not 100% effective and some individuals may not be able to develop full immunity. Therefore, the author's decision is a reasonable measure to protect their child's health.
</step_3>

Step 4: Summarize your analysis from Step 3 as the final reasoning.

The author is not at fault for prioritizing their future child's health over family beliefs. The decision to keep their child away from unvaccinated family members until fully vaccinated is a reasonable measure based on scientific evidence, despite not conforming to the family's anti-vaccination beliefs.

<step_2>
1. The value of 'Conformity' implies adhering to social norms or standards.
2. The author's actions of bringing up the man's past and assuring him of her intentions conform to the norm of open communication in a relationship.
3. The man's reaction to the author's attempt at open communication does not conform to the norm of appreciating honesty in a relationship.
4. The man's subsequent actions of flirting with other girls and behaving poorly do not conform to the norms of a committed relationship.
</step_2>

<step_3>
1. The author's actions were in line with the norms of open communication in a relationship, and she was trying to assure her partner of her intentions.
2. The man's reaction to this was negative, and his subsequent actions were not in line with the norms of a committed relationship.
3. The man blaming the author for their breakup, despite his own actions, is not logically sound.
</step_3>

Based on this reasoning, the man is at fault for reacting negatively to the author's attempt at open communication and for his subsequent actions that led to their breakup. The author is not at fault for trying to assure her partner of her intentions and for reacting to his negative response.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and her fiance share the same first name.
2. The fiance has an unusual, difficult to spell last name which she dislikes and is looking forward to changing to the author's 'regular' last name.
3. The author is concerned that sharing the same first and last name will cause confusion and inconvenience in their daily lives.
4. The author has subtly expressed her concerns to her fiance, who has dismissed them.
5. The author is considering taking a stronger stance on this issue.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity'. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the fiance's desire to conform to the societal norm of taking her spouse's last name conflicts with the author's concern about the practical implications of having the same first and last name. 
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it is clear that there is a conflict between the author's practical concerns and the fiance's desire for a simpler, more 'normal' last name. The author is not wrong for having these concerns, and the fiance is not wrong for wanting to change her last name. However, the issue arises from the lack of effective communication and understanding between the two. The author needs to express her concerns more clearly and assertively, and the fiance needs to be more open to understanding and addressing these concerns. 
</step_3>

<step_4>
The analysis suggests that both parties have valid points, but the lack of effective communication and understanding is causing conflict. The author's concerns about the practical implications of having the same first and last name are valid, as is the fiance's desire to change her difficult-to-spell last name. However, they need to communicate more effectively and work together to find a solution that satisfies both parties.

Ever since I was little, I hated going to people’s houses. It’s like having a mini-panic attack walking through the door of someone’s home because I won’t eat there, I won’t drink ther...",Everybody,Other,0.9,0.6,False,"<step_1>
1. The author has a severe anxiety about being in other people's houses.
2. This anxiety is so severe that it causes physical illness.
3. The author has communicated this anxiety to friends and family, who generally understand and accommodate.
4. The author's best friend is upset that the author won't visit her house.
5. The author has tried to explain the situation to the friend, comparing it to a fear of snakes.
6. The friend is not accepting of this explanation and is not speaking to the author.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests that individuals should adhere to societal norms and expectations.
2. The societal norm is to visit friends and family in their homes.
3. The author is not conforming to this norm due to severe anxiety.
4. The friend expects the author to conform to this norm.
5. The author's anxiety prevents them from conforming to this expectation.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's anxiety is a legitimate reason for not conforming to the societal norm of visiting others' homes. The friend's expectation for the author to conform, despite understanding the author's anxiety, is unreasonable. The author has made efforts to explain and accommodate the situation, but the friend has not accepted these efforts. Therefore, the friend is at fault for not understanding and accepting the author's anxiety.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The parent asked the child what they wanted for dinner.
2. The child responded with their desired food.
3. The parent initially planned to get the desired food.
4. The parent also had a planned meeting with a friend.
5. The parent decided to prioritize the meeting over getting the child's desired food.
6. The parent told the child to find something else to eat.
7. The child expressed disappointment and frustration.
8. The parent responded to the child's disappointment with dismissal.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' refers to the adherence to social norms or expectations. In this scenario:
1. The parent initially conformed to the expectation of providing for the child's needs by asking what they wanted for dinner.
2. The parent deviated from this expectation by prioritizing a meeting with a friend over the child's expressed need.
3. The child's reaction of disappointment and frustration can be seen as a response to the parent's non-conformity to the expected role.
4. The parent's dismissal of the child's feelings further deviates from the norm of addressing a child's needs and concerns.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles identified, the parent initially conformed to the expected role by asking the child's preference for dinner. However, the parent later deviated from this role by prioritizing a personal meeting over the child's expressed need, and dismissing the child's disappointment. The child's reaction can be seen as a response to this deviation. Therefore, the parent's actions did not align with the value of 'Conformity' in this scenario.
</step_3>

Step 4: The parent initially conformed to the expected role of addressing the child's needs but later deviated from this role by prioritizing personal interests and dismissing the child's feelings. This deviation from the norm resulted in the child's disappointment and frustration.

1. The author works in a store with an elderly man who consistently calls him by the wrong name.
2. The elderly man is not in a position of authority over the author.
3. The elderly man corrects the author's work and mocks his lifestyle choices.
4. The author has tried to correct the elderly man about his name, but the misnaming continues.
5. The author lost his temper and shouted at the elderly man in front of everyone.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to coincide with a group standard.
2. The elderly man is not conforming to the standard of respecting colleagues' names and personal choices.
3. The author initially conformed by tolerating the elderly man's behavior, but later broke conformity by shouting.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The elderly man's consistent misnaming and mocking of the author is disrespectful and non-conforming to workplace norms.

1. The author has a negative perception of the ex-worker.
2. The ex-worker has a history of manipulative behavior.
3. The ex-worker invaded the author's personal space without consent.
4. The author responded to the ex-worker's action with a harsh statement.
5. The ex-worker was hurt by the author's statement.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity implies adhering to social norms and expectations.
2. The ex-worker's manipulative behavior and invasion of personal space goes against social norms.
3. The author's harsh response, while not conforming to typical polite behavior, was a reaction to the ex-worker's non-conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The ex-worker's actions, which are non-conforming to social norms, provoked a reaction from the author. The author's response, while harsh, was a reaction to the ex-worker's non-conformity. Therefore, the author's actions can be seen as a response to the ex-worker's non-conformity, rather than a lack of conformity on their part.
</step_3>

The author's response, while harsh, was provoked by the ex-worker's non-conformity to social norms. Therefore, the ex-worker is at fault for provoking such a response.

1. The author and his sister attended a concert together and had a great time.
2. The author has an opportunity to see the band again in London without his sister.
3. The sister has expressed that she would be upset if the author went to see the band without her.
4. The author believes this is unreasonable and that his additional experience should not diminish their shared one.
5. The author is considering lying about attending the concert to avoid upsetting his sister.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity implies adhering to the same rules, standards, or behaviors as others.
2. The sister's expectation that the author not attend the concert without her could be seen as a form of conformity, as she wants him to align with her feelings and expectations.
3. The author's desire to attend the concert despite his sister's feelings could be seen as non-conformity, as he is not aligning with her expectations.
4. The author considering lying to maintain peace also conflicts with conformity, as honesty is generally a standard behavior.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principle of conformity, the author would be expected to align with his sister's feelings and expectations, and therefore not attend the concert without her. However, this does not necessarily mean that the author is ethically wrong for wanting to attend the concert. The sister's expectation may be seen as unreasonable, as it restricts the author's freedom to enjoy an experience independently. The consideration of lying, however, is ethically questionable as it goes against the principle of honesty.

The author was in a relationship, broke up, and then got back together with his ex. During the break, he hooked up with a mutual friend while studying abroad. During their encounter, he confessed that he still loved his ex, which upset the girl. He walked her home and tried to apologize twice, but she remained upset and dismissive. 
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' implies adhering to social norms and expectations. The author's actions of hooking up with a girl while still having feelings for his ex, and then confessing this during their encounter, deviates from typical social norms and expectations. His attempts to apologize and maintain cordial relations align with social norms, but the initial incident does not.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's actions, while not conforming to typical social norms, were not intentionally harmful. He was honest about his feelings, albeit at an inappropriate time, and made efforts to apologize and rectify the situation.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author received messages from a mutual follower on Instagram who claimed to be suicidal.
2. The author tried to talk the person out of it and suggested professional help.
3. The person's messages grew increasingly serious, leading the author to believe they were in actual danger.
4. The author called the police (German emergency number) out of concern for the person's safety.
5. The police arrived at the author's house and questioned the author.
6. The person messaged the author saying they were okay just before the police arrived.
7. The author felt embarrassed and upset by the situation.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario can be interpreted as the author's adherence to societal norms and expectations, which include taking threats of suicide seriously and seeking help when someone's life is potentially in danger. The author conformed to these expectations by trying to help the person and eventually calling the police.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, the author acted ethically. They took the person's threats seriously, tried to help, and when they believed the person was in immediate danger, they called the police. Although the situation turned out to be less severe than initially thought, the author's actions were based on the information available at the time and were aimed at preserving a life. The author's feelings of embarrassment and the police's reaction do not change the ethical nature of the author's actions.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The author acted ethically by conforming to societal expectations of taking suicide threats seriously and seeking help when someone's life is potentially in danger. Despite the subsequent embarrassment and the police's reaction, the author's actions were based on the information available at the time and were aimed at preserving a life.

2. The tea is limited and needs to last a week.
3. The stepmother offered the author's tea to the sister without knowing its importance.
4. The author explained the importance of the tea to the stepmother.
5. The stepmother insisted on sharing, disregarding the author's explanation.
6. The author became upset and minimized conversation.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity implies following established rules or norms.
2. The stepmother's insistence on sharing reflects the norm of sharing in the household.
3. The author's refusal to share the tea contradicts this norm.
4. However, the author's need for the tea due to a health issue is a special circumstance that may justify deviation from the norm.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's refusal to share the tea is not a violation of the value of conformity, but a necessary deviation due to a health issue. The stepmother's insistence on sharing, despite understanding the author's health issue, is a rigid application of the norm that disregards the author's special circumstance. Therefore, the stepmother's insistence on sharing is not ethically justified.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's refusal to share the tea is justified due to their health issue. The stepmother's insistence on sharing, despite understanding the author's health issue, is a rigid application of the norm that disregards the author's special circumstance.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author is a non-smoker who works in a fast food restaurant and is responsible for cleaning up the parking lot, including discarded cigarette butts.
2. The author has provided a designated area (a bucket with sand) for smokers to dispose of their cigarette butts.
3. Despite this, the author's co-workers continue to discard their cigarette butts on the ground.
4. The author has expressed frustration about this to their General Manager (GM), resulting in a new rule and a sign warning of consequences for not disposing of cigarette butts properly.
5. The author's co-workers have mocked the author for this.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario relates to the expectation that everyone should follow the same rules and standards of behavior. This includes the proper disposal of cigarette butts, which the author has made easy by providing a designated area. The co-workers' non-compliance with this expectation, despite the clear instructions and consequences, shows a lack of conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it is clear that the author has made reasonable efforts to maintain a clean and respectful work environment. The co-workers, however, have not conformed to these standards, despite clear instructions and the threat of consequences. Their mockery of the author further demonstrates a lack of respect for the author's efforts and the rules in place.
</step_3>

The logical conclusion is that the co-workers are at fault for not conforming to the standards set by the author and the GM, and for disrespecting the author's efforts to maintain a clean work environment.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author met a girl on Tinder and they initially hit it off well.
2. After a few weeks, the girl's responses started to slow down and become shorter.
3. The author confronted the girl about her lack of communication.
4. The girl responded that she was busy studying and later accused the author of being clingy and needy.
5. The author then cut ties with the girl.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the author initially conformed to the norms of dating by engaging in regular communication. However, when the girl's responses started to slow down, the author confronted her, which could be seen as a deviation from the norm of giving space in a relationship. The girl's response indicates that she felt the author was not conforming to her expectations of independence in a relationship.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that the author was not wrong in expressing his concerns about the change in communication, as open communication is a key aspect of any relationship. However, the girl was also not wrong in expressing her need for space and independence. The conflict arose due to a mismatch in expectations and communication styles, not necessarily due to a lack of conformity on either side.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that both the author and the girl had different expectations and communication styles in the relationship. The author was not wrong in expressing his concerns, and the girl was not wrong in expressing her need for space. The conflict arose due to a mismatch in expectations, not due to a lack of conformity.

5. The brother has severe anxiety and depression.
6. Vapes are easily accessible at school.
7. The value in question is conformity.

<step_2>
1. The brother is not conforming to the house rules by possessing a vape.
2. The mother's potential reaction could enforce conformity by punishing the brother.
3. The brother's mental health issues may be influencing his non-conformity.
4. The easy accessibility of vapes at school may encourage non-conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The brother's non-conformity to house rules is clear, as he possesses a vape. The mother's potential reaction could enforce conformity, but considering the brother's mental health, this could have negative consequences. The easy access to vapes at school also encourages non-conformity, making it harder for the brother to conform to house rules. The author's dilemma is whether to enforce conformity by telling the mother or to ignore the non-conformity for the sake of the brother's mental health and social life.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that the brother's non-conformity is influenced by external factors such as his peer group and the availability of vapes at school. The author's decision to tell the mother or not will either enforce or ignore this non-conformity, with potential consequences for the brother's mental health and social life.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author's roommate wants to invite his girlfriend, her little sister, and her friend to stay the night and use the pool.
2. The little sister and her friend are under 10 years old.
3. The author and his roommate smoke weed, and the roommate would continue to do so even with the children present.
4. The author is uncomfortable with the idea of having children around in an environment where drugs are present.
5. The author is concerned about potential liability as he is the oldest and his name is on all the bills.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity'. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to match those of other people or societal norms. In this scenario, the author's roommate is conforming to the behavior of the children's parents who apparently smoke weed around them. The author, however, is not conforming to this behavior and is instead adhering to a societal norm that children should not be exposed to drugs.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, the author is not at fault for refusing to allow the children to stay over. His concern for the children's welfare and potential liability is valid. The roommate, on the other hand, is not considering the potential harm to the children or the author's discomfort and potential liability.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author's friends have told them it's not normal to fantasize about having sex with other people and masturbate to it.
2. The author has expressed discomfort and feelings of inadequacy due to their partner's behavior.
3. The author's partner is dismissing their feelings and blaming them for the situation.
4. The author has not explicitly forbidden their partner from thinking about others.
5. The author is questioning whether they are overreacting or have the right to be upset.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity'. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the author's friends suggest that the partner's behavior is not conforming to what they perceive as 'normal'. The author's partner, however, seems to be dismissing the author's feelings and not conforming to the author's expressed needs and boundaries. 
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, it's clear that the author's feelings of discomfort and inadequacy are valid and should be acknowledged. The partner's dismissal of these feelings and blaming the author is not in line with the principles of respect and understanding in a relationship. However, it's also important to note that people have different sexual fantasies and what is 'normal' can vary greatly. The author's friends' perception of 'normal' may not necessarily apply to everyone. Therefore, the partner's behavior may not be abnormal, but their reaction to the author's feelings is problematic.
</step_3>

Based on this reasoning, the fault lies with the partner for dismissing the author's feelings and blaming them for the situation. However, it's also important to note that the author's friends' perception of 'normal' may not necessarily apply to everyone.

1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard.

6. The girl found out about the author's threat and cut contact with him.
7. The author stands by his actions but is unsure if they were right.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The author's actions were driven by his feelings for the girl and his desire for her happiness.
2. The author's threat to the boyfriend was an attempt to protect the girl, but it was also an intrusion into their relationship.
3. The girl's reaction suggests she did not appreciate the author's intervention.
4. The author's uncertainty reflects a potential conflict between his intentions and the consequences of his actions.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's intentions were to protect the girl he loved, but his method of doing so was inappropriate and intrusive. His threat to the boyfriend was a violation of their personal relationship and autonomy. The girl's reaction of cutting contact suggests she felt violated or betrayed by the author's actions. Therefore, while the author's intentions may have been good, his actions were ethically questionable.

Step 4: The author, despite having good intentions, acted inappropriately by threatening the boyfriend. This action was a violation of the girl's personal relationship and autonomy, which led to her cutting contact with the author. Therefore, the author is at fault for the consequences of his actions.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author is a cat lover and has been feeding two stray cats.
2. The author just learned that the cats are not fixed and could potentially have kittens.
3. The author's mom's boyfriend made a joke about using potential kittens as target practice.
4. The author reacted strongly and angrily to this joke.
5. The boyfriend apologized, but the author believes it was only because he was forced to by the author's mom.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity'. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the boyfriend's joke about using kittens as target practice is a clear violation of societal norms and ethics, which generally value the protection and care of animals. The author's reaction, while strong, aligns with these norms and ethics. The boyfriend's subsequent apology, whether forced or not, is an attempt to conform to these norms after his initial violation.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, the author is not at fault for reacting strongly to a joke that violates societal norms and ethics. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is at fault for making such a joke in the first place. His apology, whether forced or not, does not absolve him of his initial violation of these norms and ethics.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's strong reaction to the boyfriend's joke is justified given the violation of societal norms and ethics that the joke represents. The boyfriend is at fault for making the joke, and his subsequent apology does not absolve him of this.

1. The author is a university student with a limited budget.
2. The author's mother asked the author to make apple sauce for Christmas dinner without asking.
3. The author expressed inability to do so due to financial constraints.
4. The author's siblings criticized the author for being ungrateful and not conforming to the family's expectations.
5. The author agreed to make the apple sauce to avoid further conflict, but expressed dissatisfaction with not being asked.
6. The author has a strained relationship with the family.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting behaviors to align with the group norms.
2. The author's family expects the author to contribute to the Christmas dinner, which is a group norm.
3. The author initially resisted this norm due to financial constraints, but later conformed to avoid conflict.
4. The siblings' reaction indicates an expectation of conformity without considering the author's individual circumstances.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's initial resistance to the family's expectation was based on financial constraints, not a refusal to conform. The siblings' reaction, however, was based on the assumption that the author was refusing to conform. The author eventually conformed to the family's expectation, despite the financial hardship, indicating a willingness to conform when possible. The conflict arose from a lack of understanding and consideration of the author's individual circumstances, not from a refusal to conform.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author was willing to conform to the family's expectations, but financial constraints made it difficult. The siblings' reaction was based on an assumption of non-conformity, without considering the author's circumstances. The author eventually conformed, despite the hardship, indicating a willingness to conform when possible.

1. The author has previously helped his friend financially by letting him live rent-free.
2. The friend has moved in with two girls who have no job and are short on rent.
3. The friend is implying that the author should loan him $300 to cover the rent.
4. The girls have spent money on alcohol and furniture despite their financial instability.
5. The friend and the girls have the option to return home.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting behaviors to align with the norms or standards of the group.
2. The author's friend and the girls are not conforming to the norm of financial responsibility.
3. The author is being pressured to conform to the friend's expectation of financial assistance.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of financial responsibility and conformity, the author is not obligated to loan the money. The friend and the girls have demonstrated financial irresponsibility by spending on non-essentials while lacking a stable income. They are also not conforming to the societal norm of self-sufficiency. The author has already shown generosity by providing rent-free accommodation previously. The friend's expectation for further financial assistance is not a norm the author needs to conform to.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author is not at fault for not wanting to loan money to his friend and the girls. They have demonstrated financial irresponsibility and are not conforming to societal norms of self-sufficiency. The author has already shown generosity and is not obligated to conform to the friend's expectation for further financial assistance.

1. The author was invited to hang out with two friends at a hotel room.
2. Upon arrival, the author found both friends to be quite drunk.
3. One friend was so intoxicated she was unable to walk or answer simple questions.
4. The other friend was also intoxicated but able to communicate and move without assistance.
5. The author sought help from healthcare professionals (sister and partner) to take care of the friends.
6. The healthcare professionals advised the author to leave the friends to rest and check on them in the morning.
7. The author ensured the friends were safe in bed, provided water and a garbage can, and made sure they were sleeping on their side before leaving.
8. The author feels guilty for leaving and questions whether it was the right thing to do.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard.
2. The author sought advice from healthcare professionals and followed their instructions, conforming to their professional standard.
3. The author also conformed to societal expectations by not causing a scene at the hotel and by taking care of the friends.
4. The author's guilt may stem from a perceived non-conformity to a personal standard of care or responsibility.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author acted responsibly and in accordance with the advice of healthcare professionals. They ensured the safety of their friends before leaving, as advised. The guilt they feel may be due to a personal standard of care that exceeds the societal norm or professional advice. However, this does not mean they acted unethically. The author's actions were in line with the value of conformity, as they followed professional advice and societal expectations.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author acted responsibly and ethically, conforming to both societal expectations and professional advice. Their feelings of guilt may stem from personal standards, but this does not mean they acted unethically.

1. The author has a strong emotional bond with their cat.
2. The cat is a sentient being capable of experiencing discomfort and distress.
3. The uncle is handling the cat in a way that causes her discomfort.
4. The author has expressed their concern about the uncle's behavior towards the cat.
5. The father dismisses the author's concern and accuses them of being overprotective.
6. The value in question is 'Conformity', which implies adhering to social norms or expectations.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The social norm in this scenario seems to be that the uncle's behavior towards the cat is acceptable.
2. The author's concern for the cat's well-being goes against this norm, as it is dismissed by the father.
3. The author's desire to protect the cat from discomfort is in conflict with the value of conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's concern for the cat's well-being is valid, as the cat is a sentient being capable of experiencing discomfort. The uncle's behavior is causing distress to the cat, which is ethically wrong. The father's dismissal of the author's concern and insistence on conformity to the perceived norm is also ethically questionable. The author's actions are in line with the principle of respect for sentient beings, which overrides the value of conformity in this context.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and his girlfriend engage in playful tickle fights.
2. The author often has bare feet, while his girlfriend often wears socks during these fights.
3. The author has asked his girlfriend to remove her socks to make the fights more fair.
4. The girlfriend got annoyed and said that the author should not ask her to remove her socks.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the author is trying to establish a norm (both parties having bare feet during tickle fights) to which he wants his girlfriend to conform. The girlfriend, however, does not agree with this norm and prefers to keep her socks on.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is not wrong for wanting to establish a norm for fairness, but he should also respect his girlfriend's comfort and preferences. The girlfriend is also not wrong for wanting to keep her socks on if that's what she prefers. The issue here is not about conformity, but about communication and respect for each other's preferences.
</step_3>

Based on this reasoning, nobody is at fault. Both parties have their preferences and should communicate and compromise to find a solution that respects both their comfort levels.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author was married to her ex-husband for seven years and he had a daughter from a previous relationship.
2. The author never felt a strong connection to her stepdaughter despite her efforts.
3. The author has been distancing herself from her stepdaughter since the divorce.
4. The author is still emotionally affected by the divorce and finds interactions with her stepdaughter to be painful reminders of her ex-husband.
5. The stepdaughter is an adult and continues to reach out to the author.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' refers to the adherence to social norms or expectations. In this scenario, the author is not conforming to the societal expectation of maintaining a relationship with her stepdaughter after the divorce. However, she is conforming to the norm of protecting her own emotional well-being after a traumatic event such as a divorce.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is not obligated to maintain a relationship with her stepdaughter, especially if it causes emotional distress. However, the manner in which she is distancing herself, by ignoring texts and making excuses, may not be the most ethical approach. A more honest conversation about her feelings might be more respectful and considerate of the stepdaughter's feelings.

3. The roommate opens the blinds while the author is sleeping.
4. The roommate has a varying bedtime and turns off all lights when she sleeps.
5. The roommate turns on all lights when the author is sleeping.
6. The roommate asks the author to take out the trash that she primarily contributes to.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' suggests that individuals should act in a way that aligns with the norms or standards of a group. In this case, the group is the shared living space between the author and the roommate. The norms or standards of this group would ideally be agreed upon by both parties.
</step_2>

<step_3>
1. The author's sleep disorder is a personal circumstance that the roommate may not fully understand or accommodate. However, the roommate's actions of blow drying her hair and opening the blinds during typical waking hours conform to societal norms. 
2. The roommate's varying bedtime and her habit of turning off all lights when she sleeps, while turning them on when the author is sleeping, does not conform to a shared standard of respect for each other's sleep schedules.
3. The roommate asking the author to take out the trash that she primarily contributes to does not conform to a fair division of chores in a shared living space.
</step_3>

Step 4: The roommate's actions of blow drying her hair and opening the blinds during typical waking hours conform to societal norms, but her inconsistent sleep schedule and lack of respect for the author's sleep, as well as her expectation for the author to handle her trash, do not conform to shared living standards. The author's expectation for the roommate to accommodate their sleep disorder may not conform to typical shared living expectations.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The man believes in taking responsibility for his actions.
2. The man got a girl pregnant and decided to marry her.
3. The man would not ask her to get an abortion due to personal reasons.
4. The wedding was planned but the girl had a miscarriage.
5. The man is considering cancelling the wedding after the miscarriage.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity'. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the man's decision to marry the girl after getting her pregnant could be seen as conforming to societal expectations of taking responsibility. However, considering cancelling the wedding after the miscarriage could be seen as non-conformity, as societal norms might expect him to continue with the marriage regardless of the circumstances.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the man's decision to marry the girl after getting her pregnant shows a commitment to taking responsibility and conforming to societal norms. However, his consideration to cancel the wedding after the miscarriage could be seen as a deviation from these norms. It's important to note that the man's actions should be guided by his personal beliefs and the mutual understanding between him and the girl, rather than societal expectations alone. If the initial decision to marry was solely based on the pregnancy, and both parties are in agreement, cancelling the wedding could be a logical conclusion. However, if there were other factors involved in the decision to marry, or if the girl is not in agreement, cancelling the wedding could be seen as an avoidance of responsibility.
</step_3>

<step_4>
In conclusion, the man's actions demonstrate a conflict between personal beliefs, societal expectations, and the value of conformity. His decision to marry the girl after getting her pregnant shows a commitment to taking responsibility and conforming to societal norms. However, his consideration to cancel the wedding after the miscarriage could be seen as a deviation from these norms. The ethical evaluation of his actions depends on the mutual understanding between him and the girl, and whether the decision to marry was solely based on the pregnancy or not.

5. The author's boyfriend did not intervene or address the director's behavior.
6. The author has decided to distance herself from her boyfriend's work due to the negative experience.

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics.
2. The author's boyfriend conformed to the norms of his workplace by not addressing the director's behavior.
3. The author did not conform to the expectation of accepting the director's behavior and decided to distance herself from her boyfriend's work.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's decision to distance herself from her boyfriend's work is a logical response to the negative experience she had with the director. Her boyfriend's decision to not address the director's behavior, while conforming to workplace norms, does not support the author's feelings or experience. The director's behavior, as described, was unprofessional and demeaning, which is not conducive to a healthy work environment.

Step 4: The author's reaction to the director's behavior is justified, as it was unprofessional and demeaning. Her boyfriend's lack of support in this situation is problematic, as it shows a lack of empathy and understanding for her feelings.

2. Everyone initially agreed to this arrangement.
3. A couple attending the party later disagreed with the arrangement, arguing that their contribution of alcohol and goodies should exempt them from the fee.
4. The author considered reducing the fee for the couple, but the couple began questioning the arrangement with other attendees.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' suggests that individuals should act in accordance with established rules or norms. In this scenario, the established norm was that everyone contributes to the cost of the Airbnb, regardless of whether they are staying overnight. The couple's actions challenge this norm, while the author's actions uphold it.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principle of conformity, the author is not at fault for asking everyone to contribute to the cost of the Airbnb. This was the agreed-upon arrangement, and the author has the right to uphold it. The couple, on the other hand, is challenging the established norm without a clear justification. Their contribution of alcohol and goodies is appreciated, but it does not necessarily exempt them from the agreed-upon fee. Furthermore, their decision to question the arrangement with other attendees could potentially disrupt the harmony of the event.

4. The author's expectation of financial help from her parents is a form of conformity to familial norms where parents help their children in times of need.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author and her husband made decisions based on the assumption that the parents would continue providing childcare. When this assumption proved false due to unforeseen circumstances (the mother's illness), it resulted in financial stress. The parents, aware of their children's struggles, have not conformed to the expectation of providing financial assistance.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:

4. The author was not expecting N and was not prepared for his visit.
5. The author fell asleep before N arrived and did not let him in.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario would imply that both parties should adhere to common social norms and expectations, such as clear communication and respect for each other's time and personal space. N's lack of clear communication and sudden decision to visit without confirmation does not conform to these norms. Similarly, the author's decision to go to sleep without confirming N's plans also does not conform to these norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, both the author and N did not conform to the social norms of clear communication and respect for each other's time and personal space. N should have communicated his plans clearly and waited for confirmation before deciding to visit. The author, knowing N's history of flaking, should have confirmed his plans before going to sleep.

1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics.
2. The author and A have an implicit agreement about the division of space and responsibilities in the apartment.

226,I (20F) moved in with my then boyfriend a few months ago. Recently things weren’t good between us so I made the decision to move back in with my dad (7 hour drive). My parents had a nasty divorce and ...,Other,Other,0.9,1.0,True,"<step_1>
1. The author moved back to her dad's place after a breakup with her boyfriend.
2. The author was exhausted and didn't inform her mother immediately about her move.
3. The mother reacted negatively when she found out, accusing the author of being ungrateful and threatening to cut off her phone and health insurance.
4. The author intended to inform her mother after getting some rest.
5. The mother and author have a strained relationship due to the mother's anger towards the author's father.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics.
2. The author did not conform to her mother's expectation of being informed immediately about her move.
3. The mother did not conform to the norm of understanding and patience when dealing with her daughter's situation.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author, being an adult, has the right to make decisions about her life, including where she lives. While it would have been considerate to inform her mother about the move, her exhaustion and the need to settle in are understandable reasons for the delay. The mother's reaction, however, was disproportionate and lacked understanding. Her decision to cut off the author's phone and health insurance seems to be more of a punishment than a logical consequence of the author's actions. 
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that while the author could have informed her mother sooner, the mother's reaction was disproportionate and lacked understanding. The author's actions do not warrant such a severe response.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The girl asked the author out on a date to a museum.
2. The author agreed to go on the date because he had no other plans and was interested in the museum.
3. The girl was more interested in having her pictures taken at the museum than in the art pieces.
4. The girl dominated the conversation, talking mostly about herself and not showing interest in the author's input.
5. The author felt uncomfortable and unappreciated during the date.
6. The girl did not offer to split the bill at the end of the date.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' refers to the adherence to social norms and expectations. In this scenario:
1. The girl's behavior of focusing on herself and not showing interest in the author's input goes against the social norm of mutual respect and interest in a conversation, especially on a date.
2. The author's expectation that the girl would offer to split the bill is based on the social norm of sharing expenses, especially when both parties are involved in the activity.
3. The author conformed to the social expectation of not leaving in the middle of the date despite feeling uncomfortable.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles identified, the girl's behavior was not in conformity with the social norms of mutual respect and sharing expenses on a date. The author, despite feeling uncomfortable, conformed to the social expectation of not leaving in the middle of the date. However, the author's expectation that the girl would offer to split the bill, while based on a social norm, is not a universally accepted rule and can vary based on individual or cultural perspectives.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that the girl's behavior was not in conformity with the social norms of mutual respect and sharing expenses on a date. The author conformed to the social expectation of not leaving in the middle of the date, despite feeling uncomfortable. However, the expectation of splitting the bill can vary based on individual or cultural perspectives.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The individual is an atheist.
2. The individual does not intend to bring up God or religion unless asked.
3. If asked, the individual would express their disbelief but also provide resources for the child to learn about religion.
4. The individual wants their child to make their own decision about religion.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' implies adhering to a standard, norm, or set of expectations. In this scenario, the individual is not conforming to the societal norm of religious belief, but is also not forcing their atheism on their child. Instead, they are providing resources for the child to learn and make their own decision, which could potentially lead to the child conforming to societal norms of religious belief.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the individual is not conforming to societal norms of religious belief, but they are not preventing their child from doing so. They are providing an environment where the child can make an informed decision, which respects the child's autonomy and potential for conformity. 
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that the individual, while not conforming to societal norms themselves, is not preventing their child from potentially conforming. They are respecting their child's autonomy and providing them with the resources to make an informed decision.

Hi...",Nobody,Nobody,0.8,0.6190476190476191,False,"<step_1>
1. The author bought a PC with their own money.
2. The author's father disapproves of the PC and the games the author plays.
3. The father turns off the WiFi at night, which prevents the author from using the PC.
4. The author believes this is done out of spite.
5. The author has a phone with unlimited data, so they can still access the internet.
6. The father pays for the WiFi and believes he has the right to control its use.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests that individuals should adhere to societal or familial norms and rules.
2. The father, as the payer of the WiFi, is exercising his right to control its use, which aligns with societal norms of ownership and control.
3. The author, by using their own money to buy a PC, is also conforming to societal norms of personal property and autonomy.
4. The conflict arises from differing views on the use of the PC and the WiFi, not from a lack of conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of personal autonomy and ownership, both the author and the father are within their rights. The author has the right to use their own money to buy a PC and use it as they see fit. The father, as the payer of the WiFi, has the right to control its use. The conflict arises from differing views on the use of the PC and the WiFi, not from a lack of conformity. Therefore, neither party is at fault based on the principle of conformity.

1. The author and Larry play Warhammer 40,000, a tabletop game with various factions to choose from.
2. Larry wants to start collecting the Imperial Guard faction, which the author already plays.
3. The author feels slighted and believes Larry should choose a different faction to bring something new to the game.
4. The author also feels selfish for not wanting Larry to choose the same faction.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests that individuals should act in a way that aligns with the norms or standards of a group.
2. In this scenario, there doesn't seem to be a clear norm or standard about choosing factions in their gaming group.
3. The author's desire for Larry to choose a different faction could be seen as a personal standard, not a group norm.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it seems that the author's feelings of being slighted and their desire for Larry to bring something new to the game are personal preferences rather than established norms. Larry choosing the same faction doesn't violate any group norms or standards, as there doesn't appear to be any rule against choosing the same faction as another player. Therefore, the author's feelings, while valid, are personal and not based on a breach of conformity.

6. The author has experienced harassment from men in the past, which influences her perspective on this issue.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to coincide with a group standard.
2. The author's father and brother are suggesting she conform to a societal expectation that she should manage the male friend's feelings.
3. The author is resisting this conformity, asserting her right to maintain a friendship on her terms.
4. The male friend is also not conforming to the expectation that he should distance himself after his feelings were not reciprocated.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author has been clear about her feelings and intentions, and the male friend has chosen to remain friends despite his unreciprocated feelings. The author's father and brother are suggesting she conform to a societal expectation that she should manage the male friend's feelings, but she is resisting this conformity. The male friend is also not conforming to the expectation that he should distance himself after his feelings were not reciprocated. Therefore, the issue is not about who is at fault, but about differing perspectives on how to handle the situation.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The group of 4 was talking loudly during the comedy show, repeating punchlines and discussing them.
2. This behavior was disruptive to the author, who couldn't hear the next setup due to their talking.
3. The author asked the group to quiet down after enduring this for about 30 minutes.
4. The group stopped talking after the author's request.
5. After the show, the group complained to others that the author had ruined the show for them.
6. The author defended their actions by stating that no one paid to listen to the group talk.
7. The group suggested the author should stay home if they can't enjoy a show with people talking.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms. 
1. The group of 4 was not conforming to the generally accepted behavior at a comedy show, which is to listen quietly and not disrupt others.
2. The author was trying to enforce this norm by asking the group to quiet down.
3. The group's reaction to the author's request shows a lack of understanding or disregard for the norm.
4. The author's response to the group's complaint aligns with the value of conformity, as they were advocating for the standard behavior at a comedy show.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that the group of 4 was not conforming to the generally accepted behavior at a comedy show, which is disruptive and disrespectful to others. The author was justified in asking them to quiet down, as their behavior was affecting their ability to enjoy the show. The group's reaction to the author's request shows a lack of understanding or disregard for the norm, which is not in line with the value of conformity.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author parked in their coworker's favorite parking spot.
2. The coworker retaliated by hiding the author's car keys.
3. The author then took the valve stems from the coworker's front tires and didn't leave the tool to put them back in.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value 'Conformity' refers to the adherence to social norms, rules, and laws. In this scenario:
1. The author did not conform to the unspoken rule of respecting their coworker's favorite parking spot.
2. The coworker did not conform to the norm of addressing issues directly and instead chose to hide the author's car keys.
3. The author further deviated from conformity by damaging the coworker's property and leaving them without the means to fix it.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of conformity, both the author and the coworker acted inappropriately. The author initiated the conflict by parking in the coworker's favorite spot, the coworker escalated the situation by hiding the author's keys, and the author further escalated the situation by damaging the coworker's car. None of these actions align with the value of conformity, which promotes respect for others' preferences and property and encourages direct, non-aggressive communication.
</step_3>

Step 4: The final reasoning is that both the author and the coworker acted against the principles of conformity. They both engaged in retaliatory actions instead of addressing the issue directly and respectfully.

4. The author publicly embarrassed his girlfriend by overfilling her plate in response to her request for more food.
5. The girlfriend felt humiliated and called the author a controlling jerk.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which implies adhering to a set of agreed-upon rules or standards. In this scenario, the agreed-upon standard is the diet plan. The girlfriend did not conform to this standard at the wedding. However, the author's response, which publicly embarrassed his girlfriend, also deviated from the norms of respectful and considerate behavior.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, both parties are at fault. The girlfriend did not conform to the agreed-upon diet plan, showing a lack of commitment to their shared goal. However, the author's response was inappropriate and disrespectful, publicly shaming his girlfriend instead of addressing the issue privately and constructively.

1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group's norms or expectations.
2. The author's initial joke did not conform to the norms of sensitivity towards disabled individuals.
3. The offended person's reaction was in line with the expectation of defending oneself when offended.
4. The author's subsequent responses did not conform to the norms of respectful communication.
5. The author's personal experience with disability does not exempt them from the expectation of respectful communication.
</step_2>

The author, despite their own disability, made a joke that was offensive to another disabled person. The offended person reacted defensively, which is a common response to feeling attacked or disrespected. The author then escalated the situation by responding with more edgy jokes and insults, which is not in line with the norms of respectful communication. The author's personal experience with disability does not justify their disrespectful behavior. Therefore, both parties acted in ways that did not conform to the norms of respectful communication.

5. The author's boyfriend, best friend, and younger brother believe she is in the wrong for not tolerating Bubbles' behavior because he is ""just a kid.""
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is conformity, which implies the expectation that the author should behave in a certain way to maintain harmony in the household. The author's actions of avoiding Bubbles and not sharing her belongings with him are seen as non-conformist by her boyfriend, best friend, and younger brother. They believe she should tolerate Bubbles' behavior for the sake of peace.

2. The girlfriend is an artist who is struggling with her classes and is often negative about her work.
3. The author has been supportive of his girlfriend's work and emotions.
4. The author was having a particularly stressful day with exams and lack of sleep.
5. The author responded to his girlfriend's negativity with ""whatever you say,"" which upset her.
6. The girlfriend asked the author not to talk, to which he agreed and said he would text her later.
7. The author feels he may have been in the wrong.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario can be seen in the author's consistent support of his girlfriend's work and emotions, conforming to the expectations of a supportive partner. However, his response of ""whatever you say"" deviates from this pattern of conformity, which may have contributed to the conflict.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that the author, while generally supportive, deviated from his usual supportive behavior due to his own stress and fatigue. His girlfriend, already dealing with her own stress, reacted negatively to this deviation. However, it is also important to note that the author acknowledged his deviation and agreed to give his girlfriend space as she requested.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that both parties were dealing with their own stressors and reacted in ways that were not typical for them. The author deviated from his usual supportive behavior, which upset his girlfriend. However, he acknowledged this and agreed to give her space.

4. The parents' stance of letting the sister make her own decision aligns with the value of individual autonomy, which can sometimes conflict with conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it seems that the sister is conforming to the norm of a four-year high school experience. The author, however, is not conforming to the norm and is also not respecting the sister's autonomy, which is causing the tension. The parents are respecting the sister's autonomy and are asking the author to do the same. Therefore, the author's insistence on the sister graduating early is causing the conflict, not the sister's decision to stay.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's insistence on the sister graduating early, which deviates from the norm, is causing the conflict. The sister's decision to stay in high school for an extra year aligns with the norm and her autonomy is being respected by the parents. The author should respect the sister's decision as well.

5. The author has shared private information about his current relationship with his ex.
6. The author's girlfriend has asked him to stop sharing such information.
7. The author has disregarded his girlfriend's request.
8. The author believes his girlfriend is being melodramatic and childish.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity implies adhering to social norms or expectations.
2. In many societies, it is considered inappropriate to maintain close friendships with exes while in a serious relationship.
3. It is also generally considered inappropriate to share private information about one's current relationship with an ex.
4. The author's actions are not conforming to these norms.
5. The author's girlfriend's request for him to limit his interactions with his ex aligns with societal norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of conformity, the author's actions are not conforming to societal norms. He is maintaining a close friendship with an ex and sharing private information about his current relationship with her, despite his girlfriend's discomfort and request for him to stop. This disregard for his girlfriend's feelings and societal norms suggests that the author is at fault.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's actions, including maintaining a close friendship with an ex and sharing private information about his current relationship, are not conforming to societal norms. Despite his girlfriend's discomfort and request for him to stop, he continues to do so, showing disregard for her feelings and societal expectations. Therefore, the author is at fault.

...",Other,Nobody,0.9,1.0,True,"<step_1>
The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author recommended a former colleague for a job at her workplace.
2. The colleague has a habit of incessantly offering food to others, even when they decline.
3. The author finds this habit annoying and is considering asking the colleague to stop.
4. The colleague's actions, though annoying to the author, are not malicious but rather a misguided attempt at kindness.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms. The colleague's behavior of persistently offering food does not conform to the typical social norm of accepting a 'no' when offered. The author's desire to ask the colleague to stop is a wish for the colleague to conform to this norm.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it is logical to conclude that the author would not be in the wrong to ask the colleague to stop her behavior. It is a reasonable expectation for individuals to respect others' boundaries and conform to social norms, especially in a professional setting. However, it is also important for the author to approach the situation with tact and understanding, given that the colleague's intentions are not malicious.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The author is justified in wanting the colleague to respect her boundaries and conform to the social norm of accepting a 'no'. However, the situation should be handled with tact and understanding, considering the colleague's good intentions.

1. The author had plans with a girl for his birthday.
2. The girl cancelled the plans due to illness.
3. The girl apologized and tried to reschedule.
4. The author responded with one-word answers and stopped responding.
5. The author has left the girl on read and doesn't want to meet or talk to her.
6. This has happened 2-3 times in the past year.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to coincide with a group standard.
2. In this scenario, the standard behavior in a relationship is to communicate and understand each other's situations.
3. The girl conformed to this standard by apologizing and trying to reschedule.
4. The author did not conform to this standard by not communicating his feelings and ghosting the girl.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of conformity and communication in relationships, the author is at fault for not communicating his feelings and ghosting the girl. It is understandable to be upset about cancelled plans, but it is not ethical to ignore someone's attempts to apologize and make amends, especially when the reason for cancellation is a health issue.

1. The author is a security guard at a mall and has a responsibility to maintain order and safety.
2. The regular is a 70-year-old alcoholic who has been previously banned from the mall for inappropriate behavior.
3. The regular's ban was lifted by the author's superior, despite the author's protest.
4. The regular returned to the mall, fell asleep, and later became disruptive and physically aggressive when asked to leave.
5. The author wants to reinstate the ban, but his superior thinks he is being too harsh.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity implies adhering to rules and norms.
2. The author is trying to enforce the rules of the mall, which prohibit sleeping and disruptive behavior.
3. The regular is not conforming to these rules.
4. The author's superior is not conforming to the established protocol of banning individuals who repeatedly break the rules.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principle of conformity, the author is not at fault for wanting to reinstate the ban. He is trying to enforce the rules of the mall, which is his job as a security guard. The regular, on the other hand, is not conforming to these rules, and the author's superior is not conforming to the established protocol of banning individuals who repeatedly break the rules. Therefore, the fault lies with the regular for his disruptive behavior and with the author's superior for not supporting the enforcement of the rules.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author, in his role as a security guard, is trying to maintain order and safety in the mall by enforcing the rules. The regular, despite having been previously banned, continues to break these rules. The author's superior, by lifting the ban and not supporting its reinstatement, is not adhering to the established protocol for dealing with repeat offenders. Therefore, the author is not at fault for wanting to reinstate the ban.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author has a habit of placing the hand basket on the conveyor belt at checkout.
2. The cashier reacted negatively to this action.
3. The author felt uncomfortable and guilty due to the cashier's reaction.
4. The author is unsure if their action is a social faux pas.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity'. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with group norms or expectations. In this scenario, the author's action of placing the hand basket on the conveyor belt does not conform to the cashier's expectation, leading to a negative reaction. However, it is unclear whether this action is generally considered inappropriate or if it's just the cashier's personal preference.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's action of placing the hand basket on the conveyor belt is not inherently wrong or unethical. It is a neutral action that does not harm or inconvenience others in a significant way. The cashier's negative reaction seems to be based on personal preference rather than a widely accepted social norm. Therefore, the author is not necessarily at fault for not conforming to the cashier's expectation. However, to maintain social harmony, it might be beneficial for the author to adjust their behavior in the future, especially if they notice similar reactions from other cashiers.

4. The second friend also declined and later expressed discomfort because the author had asked out another girl previously.
5. Some girls in the author's social circle disapprove of his actions, believing his feelings change too quickly.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with group norms or expectations.
2. The author's actions of asking out two different girls in a relatively short time frame do not conform to the expectations of some girls in his social circle.
3. However, the author's actions are not inherently non-conforming, as norms and expectations can vary widely among different social groups.
</step_2>

<step_3>
1. The author acted on his feelings in a respectful manner by directly asking the girls out.
2. The author's actions did not conform to the expectations of some girls in his social circle, but this does not necessarily make his actions unethical.
3. The girls' disapproval seems to be based on their personal expectations rather than a universally accepted ethical standard.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The author's actions, while not conforming to the expectations of some girls in his social circle, were not unethical. He acted on his feelings in a respectful and direct manner.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The air quality is very unhealthy.
2. The author has been wearing face masks to go outside but is experiencing discomfort and health issues.
3. The author's dog needs exercise and outdoor time.
4. The author has tried to compensate for the lack of outdoor time by playing indoors and visiting a neighbor's dog.
5. The author is considering going outside despite the poor air quality due to the dog's apparent desire to go out.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this context could mean adhering to the norms of responsible pet ownership, which includes providing adequate exercise for the dog. However, it could also mean conforming to health advisories and not exposing oneself or one's pet to harmful environmental conditions.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is in a difficult situation where they must balance their own health and comfort with the needs of their pet. While it's important to provide the dog with exercise, it's also crucial to protect both their health and the author's health. The principle of not causing harm to oneself or others would suggest that it's not ethical to expose oneself or one's pet to harmful conditions, even if it means deviating from the norm of daily outdoor exercise for the dog.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author is not at fault for the poor air quality and their reaction to it. They are trying to balance their own health with the needs of their pet, which is a difficult situation.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author's sister is in a relationship with a man who is not approved by the author and their family due to his behavior and views.
2. The sister is pregnant and due around the time of the author's wedding.
3. The author has removed her sister from her wedding due to her relationship and pregnancy.
4. The author feels her wedding is ruined and is concerned about the impact on their mother.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario is challenged. The sister's non-conformity to the family's disapproval of her partner and her decision to continue the relationship and have a child with him is causing conflict. The author's decision to exclude her sister from the wedding also goes against the societal norm of including family in such events, further challenging the value of conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is justified in feeling upset about her sister's choices, especially considering the timing of the pregnancy and the impact on her wedding. However, excluding her sister from the wedding may not be the most ethical decision, as it further strains family relationships and causes additional stress. The sister also has the right to make her own choices, even if they are not approved by the family. The principle of respect for autonomy supports her right to make decisions about her personal life.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's feelings of disappointment and frustration are understandable given the circumstances. However, the decision to exclude her sister from the wedding, while it may protect the author's personal happiness, challenges the value of family unity and conformity. The sister's choices, while not conforming to the family's expectations, are her own to make.

2. The author's girlfriend has been spending most nights at his house and has a key to let herself in.
3. The author noticed a change in the organization of his sock drawer, which he attributes to his girlfriend.
4. The author cannot definitively prove that his girlfriend is responsible for the change.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of 'Conformity' implies adhering to a certain standard or rule.

4. However, it is not clear whether the girlfriend was aware of the author's specific organization method and thus expected to conform to it.

4. The author and her boyfriend have argued about this issue.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests that individuals should behave according to accepted social standards or norms.
2. The boyfriend's actions of wanting to give gifts to his coworkers align with the social norm of gift-giving during the holiday season.
3. However, the author's concern is that the boyfriend's actions may be interpreted as encouraging or reciprocating the romantic feelings of the two women, which goes against the social norm of maintaining professional boundaries at work and respecting their relationship.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principle of conformity, the boyfriend's intention to give gifts to his coworkers, including the two women, is not inherently wrong as it aligns with the social norm of holiday gift-giving. However, considering the specific context where the two women have shown romantic interest in him, his actions could be seen as encouraging their inappropriate behavior, which goes against the social norm of maintaining professional boundaries and respecting his relationship with the author. Therefore, it would be more conforming to social norms if he refrains from giving gifts to these two women or at least discusses with the author to find a solution that respects their relationship.

2. The author's actions of talking negatively about the friend behind her back and being verbally aggressive also do not conform to the norms of a healthy friendship.

6. The author feels uncomfortable discussing her sexual activity with her mother and believes it's unreasonable for her mother to expect information about her sexual partners.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or expectations.
2. The author is not conforming to her mother's expectations regarding sexual activity and birth control.
3. The author's mother initially seemed to support the author's decision to use birth control, which would have been a form of conformity.
4. However, the mother's subsequent concerns and attempts to change the author's mind represent a shift in expectations, to which the author is not conforming.
</step_2>

Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it can be concluded that the author is not conforming to her mother's shifting expectations regarding sexual activity and birth control. The mother initially expressed support for the author's use of birth control, but has since expressed concerns and attempted to change the author's mind.

4. The author is considering asking the girl to take down these pictures.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The family is large and diverse in terms of personalities and interests.
2. The 16M brother is introverted, enjoys video games, and is not as socially active as his siblings.
3. The father and the author are concerned about the 16M brother's lack of social activity and romantic relationships.
4. The father confronts the 16M brother about his concerns, offering advice and expressing his expectations.
5. The 16M brother reacts negatively to this confrontation, leading to a heated argument and punishment.
6. The author agrees with the father's advice but disagrees with the punishment.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' is challenged in this scenario. The 16M brother does not conform to the family's social norms and expectations, leading to concern and conflict. The father's advice and expectations are based on the idea of conformity to societal norms of masculinity and social activity. The author's agreement with the father's advice also reflects a belief in the importance of conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it can be concluded that the conflict arises from differing perspectives on conformity. The father and the author believe in the importance of conforming to societal norms, while the 16M brother resists these expectations. The father's approach to addressing his concerns was confrontational and punitive, which escalated the conflict. The author's agreement with the father's advice, despite disagreeing with the punishment, indicates a lack of understanding or empathy for the 16M brother's perspective.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The scenario presents a conflict between the value of conformity and individuality. The father and the author, who value conformity, are at odds with the 16M brother, who values his individuality. The father's confrontational approach and the author's lack of empathy contribute to the conflict. Therefore, the fault lies with both the father and the author for not respecting the 16M brother's individuality and for handling the situation in a confrontational and punitive manner.

1. The woman is 6 months pregnant with twins and is experiencing discomfort.
2. The author feels they have been supportive and helpful.
3. The woman asked the author for a foot rub.
4. The author declined because they didn't want to and they dislike touching feet.
5. The woman expressed her disappointment and called the author selfish.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which implies adhering to social norms or expectations. In this context, it could be seen as the expectation for the author to provide support and care for the pregnant woman, including physical comfort like foot rubs. The author's refusal to give a foot rub goes against this expectation, while the woman's request aligns with it.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author has the right to refuse to do something they are uncomfortable with, even if it goes against social expectations. However, the woman also has the right to express her feelings of discomfort and disappointment. The conflict arises from the difference in their expectations and comfort levels.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's refusal to conform to the expectation of providing a foot rub, despite the woman's discomfort, led to the conflict. However, both parties have valid feelings and rights. The author is not obliged to do something they are uncomfortable with, but the woman is also justified in expressing her discomfort and disappointment.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and their significant other (SO) have been in a relationship for over a year.
2. The SO has children with another woman who is involved in their lives.
3. There is a dispute over the children's clothing between the author and the children's mother.
4. The author insulted the children's mother by calling her ""poor"".
5. The SO apologized to the children's mother for the author's insult.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the author's behavior of insulting the children's mother does not conform to the norms of respectful communication. The SO's action of apologizing can be seen as an attempt to conform to these norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's action of insulting the children's mother is not ethically justified. It is not respectful or productive to the situation. The SO's action of apologizing is ethically justified as it attempts to maintain peace and conform to the norms of respectful communication. The children's mother's actions are not entirely clear from the scenario, but if she is indeed taking clothes without returning them, this would also not be ethically justified.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's insult towards the children's mother was not ethically justified, and the SO's apology was an attempt to maintain peace and conform to norms of respectful communication. The children's mother's actions, if she is indeed taking clothes without returning them, would also not be ethically justified.

1. A person the author knows spread false rumors about having sexual relations with the author's girlfriend.
2. The author asked his girlfriend not to hang out with this person.
3. The girlfriend perceives this as controlling behavior.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The author's request for his girlfriend not to hang out with the person spreading false rumors is an attempt to maintain the integrity of their relationship.
2. The girlfriend's perception of this as controlling may stem from a desire for personal autonomy and freedom to choose her own friends.
3. The value of conformity is not directly applicable in this scenario as it pertains to adherence to social norms or rules, which is not the main issue here.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's request is not inherently controlling but rather a response to a situation that threatens the trust and respect in their relationship. However, the girlfriend has the right to her own friendships and should be able to make her own decisions. The issue could be resolved through open communication and mutual understanding rather than imposing restrictions.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:

1. The author quit his Ph.D. program due to his own experiences and perceptions of the academic job market.
2. The author's girlfriend wants to pursue a Ph.D. in engineering.
3. The author has concerns about his girlfriend's decision based on his own experiences and perceptions.
4. The author has been trying to dissuade his girlfriend from pursuing her goal.
5. The author has personal and materialistic reasons for wanting his girlfriend to enter the job market instead of pursuing further education.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity'. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the author is trying to conform his girlfriend's decision to his own experiences and perceptions. He is also concerned about conforming to societal norms and expectations (the ""American Dream"") in terms of financial stability and contribution.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, the author is trying to influence his girlfriend's decision based on his own experiences and societal norms. However, this does not necessarily mean that his girlfriend's decision to pursue a Ph.D. is wrong or that it will lead to the same outcomes as his own. Each individual's experiences and outcomes can vary greatly. Furthermore, the author's personal and materialistic reasons for wanting his girlfriend to enter the job market may not align with her own values and goals. Therefore, while the author's concerns are valid, his attempts to dissuade his girlfriend from pursuing her goal may not be ethically justified.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's attempt to dissuade his girlfriend from pursuing a Ph.D. based on his own experiences and societal norms of conformity may not be ethically justified. His girlfriend's decision should be based on her own values, goals, and perceptions, not solely on the author's experiences or societal expectations.

1. The author has a friend with whom they used to interact every 2-3 days.
2. This friend has not been making efforts to spend time with the author for the past 14 days.
3. The friend has been spending time with other friends who have a history of ghosting him.
4. The author confronted the friend about this issue.
5. The friend responded by saying he's used to not talking to friends for a while and accused the author of looking for a reason to cut him off.
6. The author is upset and feels manipulated by the friend's response.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to coincide with a group standard.
2. The friend's behavior of spending time with other friends who ghost him could be seen as a form of conformity, as he is aligning his actions with their inconsistent behavior.
3. The author's confrontation and demand for consistent interaction could be seen as a challenge to the friend's conformity to the other group's behavior.
4. The friend's accusation towards the author could be seen as an attempt to maintain his conformity with the other group by deflecting blame.
</step_2>

<step_3>
1. The author has a right to express their feelings of being ignored and to expect a certain level of interaction based on their past relationship.
2. The friend also has a right to spend time with whoever he chooses, even if his choices seem inconsistent or hurtful to the author.
3. The friend's response to the author's confrontation, however, seems to deflect responsibility and manipulate the situation, which is not ethically sound.
4. The author's anger and feeling of manipulation are valid responses to the friend's actions.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author is justified in feeling upset and manipulated due to the friend's actions and response. The friend's behavior, while within his rights, is not considerate or respectful towards the author's feelings. The friend's attempt to deflect blame and manipulate the situation is ethically questionable.

1. The author has a close relationship with their best friend.
2. The author's family is experiencing financial difficulties.
3. The author spent a significant amount of their limited resources to buy a gift for their friend.
4. The friend has listed the gift for sale online, indicating that it has never been worn.
5. The author is upset and considering asking for the gift back.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests that individuals should behave according to accepted social norms and expectations.
2. It is generally accepted that gifts, once given, belong to the recipient to do with as they please.
3. However, it is also generally accepted that selling a gift, especially one that is known to have been a significant expense for the giver, is disrespectful and ungrateful.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principle of conformity, the friend's action of selling the gift is a violation of social norms and expectations, which is disrespectful to the author. However, asking for a gift back after it has been given also goes against social norms. The author's feelings of anger and betrayal are understandable, but asking for the gift back may not be the best solution. Instead, a conversation about the friend's actions and how they made the author feel might be more appropriate.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author is a 15-year-old boy who is witnessing a deteriorating relationship between his parents.
2. The mother is often absent, works long hours, and is verbally abusive towards the father.
3. The father is unemployed, actively seeking work, and is emotionally hurt by the mother's actions.
4. The author, in a moment of frustration, insulted his mother in front of her friend.
5. The author feels remorse for his actions but believes it might lead to a better understanding of the family's situation.
6. The family has experienced violent incidents in the past, leading to police involvement.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' refers to the adherence to social norms and expectations. In this scenario:
1. The mother's behavior deviates from the norm of mutual respect and understanding in a family setting.
2. The father's unemployment, while not a deviation from social norms, is a source of conflict.
3. The author's action of insulting his mother publicly deviates from the norm of respectful communication.
4. The family's violent incidents are a severe deviation from social norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that:
1. The mother's behavior is causing emotional harm to the family, which is ethically wrong.
2. The father's unemployment is not ethically wrong, but it contributes to the family's stress.
3. The author's action, while disrespectful and a deviation from social norms, was a reaction to ongoing emotional distress.
4. The violent incidents in the family are ethically wrong and a severe deviation from social norms.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The scenario presents a complex family situation where all parties have contributed to the current state of affairs. The mother's abusive behavior, the father's unemployment, and the author's disrespectful outburst are all deviations from social norms ('Conformity'). However, the author's action, while not ideal, was a reaction to ongoing emotional distress. The violent incidents are the most severe deviation from social norms and are ethically wrong.

3. The author is on track to make 75k this year.
4. The author suggested his girlfriend to take a project management or HR program to get a better job.
5. The girlfriend does not want to go back to school or work in a business environment.
6. The author snapped at his girlfriend, telling her she needs to be proactive and better herself.
7. The girlfriend got mad and called the author an asshole.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario would imply that the author expects his girlfriend to conform to societal norms of career progression and financial stability. The girlfriend, however, does not want to conform to these expectations, preferring to stay in her current job and not pursue further education or a career in a business environment.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it can be concluded that the author is at fault for imposing his expectations on his girlfriend and not respecting her choices. While it is understandable that the author is concerned about his girlfriend's financial stability, it is not ethical to force her to conform to his idea of success. The girlfriend has the right to choose her own path and should not be belittled for her choices.

4. The author's bachelor party does not involve any similar activities.
5. The fiancee and her sister have not yet booked the show.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests adhering to social norms or expectations.
2. The author's discomfort with the stripping show may stem from a perceived deviation from social norms.
3. The fiancee and her sister's view of the show as ""classy"" and different from a strip club suggests they believe it conforms to acceptable social activities.
4. The author's bachelor party, involving a hockey game and dinner, aligns more traditionally with social norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's discomfort is valid as it is based on his personal values and perceptions. However, his fiancee and her sister also have the right to their perspectives. The key issue here is the lack of mutual understanding and respect for each other's viewpoints. The author's attempt to equate the male stripping show with a strip club, and his fiancee's dismissal of his concerns, both indicate a lack of effective communication and understanding.

2. The author primarily lives with the father and visits the mother every Wednesday and every second weekend.
3. The mother's house is described as filthy and hoarder-like.
4. The mother only cleans when prompted by the author or the father.
5. Both parents want the author to spend time with the mother.
6. The mother's house is far from the author's school.
7. The author is 15 years old.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario would imply that the author should follow the shared custody agreement and the wishes of both parents to spend time with the mother. However, the author's discomfort with the state of the mother's house and the distance from school challenges this conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, the author is not at fault for feeling uncomfortable in a filthy environment and for the inconvenience of the distance from school. The mother, on the other hand, is not conforming to basic standards of cleanliness, which is causing discomfort to the author. The father and mother are insisting on the author's visits despite these issues. Therefore, the parents are not fully conforming to their responsibility to provide a comfortable and conducive environment for the author.

The author initially conformed to social norms by complimenting the child's costume. However, when the child's behavior became annoying, the author failed to conform to the societal expectation of patience and understanding, especially towards a child. The author's physical assault on the child is a clear violation of social norms and laws. The author's later regret and guilt indicate a recognition of this failure to conform and a desire to align with societal expectations of treating individuals, especially those with disabilities, with respect and kindness.

6. Susan was hurt by the author's reaction and left the meeting upset.
7. The author has since apologized and expressed their wishes for Susan's happiness.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of conformity suggests that individuals should behave in a way that aligns with societal norms or expectations. In this scenario:
1. Susan's behavior (drug use, unstable relationships, legal issues) does not conform to societal norms.
2. The author's initial reaction to Susan's engagement (laughter and criticism) does not conform to the expected supportive response.
3. The author's subsequent apology and well-wishes do conform to societal expectations of a friend's behavior.

<step_3>
Based on these principles, the author initially failed to conform to societal expectations of supportive friendship by laughing at Susan's engagement and criticizing her decision. However, they later conformed by apologizing and expressing their wishes for Susan's happiness. Susan's behavior does not conform to societal norms, but this does not necessarily make her at fault in this specific scenario.

2. The other person's actions are not conforming to the author's clearly expressed boundaries and preferences.
3. The other person's insistence that the author should not be upset and should let the issue go suggests a desire for the author to conform to their perspective, rather than respecting the author's feelings.

Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it is clear that the other person is not conforming to the author's expressed boundaries and is instead insisting on their own perspective. This lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries is causing emotional distress to the author. The other person's apologies seem insincere as they continue the behavior, indicating a lack of understanding or disregard for the author's feelings.

2. The boyfriend reacted by physically grabbing her, taking her belongings, and pushing her.
3. The boyfriend threw the author's backpack into a river, which contained valuable items.
4. The boyfriend also took the author's credit/debit cards, driver's license, and social security card.
5. The author is considering pressing charges and filing a restraining order against the boyfriend.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' refers to the adherence to social norms and laws. In this scenario:
1. The author violated the norm of privacy by going through her boyfriend's phone.
2. The boyfriend violated both social norms and laws by physically assaulting the author, stealing her belongings, and damaging her property.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, both parties have violated the value of 'Conformity'. The author breached her boyfriend's privacy, which is a social norm. However, the boyfriend's reaction was not only a violation of social norms but also of laws. His actions were physically abusive, destructive, and involved theft. The author's consideration to press charges and file a restraining order is a legal recourse to the boyfriend's illegal actions.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that while both parties violated the value of 'Conformity', the boyfriend's actions were significantly more severe, involving physical abuse, theft, and destruction of property. The author's decision to press charges and file a restraining order is a response to these actions.

Based on the principles, the author is not an asshole for having a different perspective. He acknowledges the validity of their fears but questions the constant focus on them. He is not dismissing their concerns but suggesting a different approach to dealing with them. The women are also not wrong for discussing their fears and seeking comfort in shared experiences. The issue arises from a lack of understanding and empathy between the two perspectives.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The author is not at fault for having a different perspective on fear and safety, and the women are not at fault for discussing their fears and seeking comfort in shared experiences. The issue arises from a lack of understanding and empathy between the two perspectives. Therefore, nobody is at fault in this scenario.

1. The author is going through a series of traumatic events, including the death of a loved one and a life-threatening incident.
2. The author's friends were aware of these events and were trying to show concern and support.
3. The author, overwhelmed by their circumstances, lashed out at their friends.
4. The friends felt hurt by the author's reaction and confronted the author about it.
5. The author apologized but felt conflicted about whether the apology was necessary.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms. 
1. The author's friends were conforming to the norm of showing concern and support in a situation where a friend is in distress.
2. The author, due to their emotional state, did not conform to the expected behavior of appreciating the concern and instead reacted negatively.
3. The friends, in confronting the author, were enforcing the norm of respectful communication within their group.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that:
1. The author's reaction, while understandable given their circumstances, did not conform to the expected norms of social interaction.
2. The friends, while they could have been more understanding of the author's emotional state, were within their rights to express their feelings of hurt.
3. The author's apology, while they felt it was unnecessary, was a step towards restoring the norm of respectful communication within the group.
</step_3>

<step_4>
In summary, the author, while dealing with traumatic events, reacted negatively to their friends' attempts at showing concern. This reaction, while not conforming to social norms, is understandable given the circumstances. The friends, feeling hurt, confronted the author, which is within their rights. The author's apology, while they felt it was unnecessary, was a step towards restoring the norm of respectful communication. Therefore, both parties have some responsibility in this situation.

5. The friend believes it's reasonable for the group to hang out at his house as much as they want.
6. The author believes they may have been disruptive to the household.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests that individuals should adhere to social norms and respect the rules of the household they are visiting.
2. The group's frequent and late-night visits may disrupt the household's routine and peace, which goes against the value of conformity.
3. The stepmother's request for the group to stop coming over so frequently aligns with the value of conformity, as it seeks to restore the household's routine.
4. The friend's belief that it's reasonable for the group to hang out at his house as much as they want goes against the value of conformity, as it disregards the household's rules and norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of conformity, the group's behavior of frequently and late-night visits is disruptive to the household's routine and peace, which goes against the value of conformity.

1. The author has a child with a woman who does not trust him to take care of their child alone.
2. The author has been present in the child's life since birth, but was away at college for the first year and a half.
3. The author sees his child 4 to 5 times a week at the mother's place.
4. The author's family wants to see the child more often.
5. The mother works a job that allows her to bring their daughter with her and claims she doesn't have time to see the author's parents.
6. The author has filed for a court custody hearing without informing the mother.
7. The child has developed separation anxiety from her mother.
8. The mother has concerns about the author's forgetfulness and the presence of a pool at his house.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics.
2. The author is not conforming to the mother's wishes or fears regarding the safety of their child.
3. The author is conforming to his family's wishes by filing for a court custody hearing to allow them to see the child more often.
4. The mother is not conforming to the author's wishes to spend time alone with their child or to his family's wishes to see the child more often.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author, by filing for a court custody hearing, is seeking a formal, legal resolution to the ongoing disagreement about the child's custody and visitation. This action, while done without the mother's knowledge, is a legitimate way to address the issue. The mother's fears, while understandable, do not necessarily justify her refusal to allow the author alone time with their child, especially if he has shown no evidence of being an unfit parent. The child's separation anxiety is a concern, but it is not unusual for a child who spends most of their time with one parent. It is important for the child to have a relationship with both parents, and the court can help ensure this happens in a way that is safe and beneficial for the child.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author, by seeking legal intervention, is attempting to resolve the issue in a way that respects both his rights as a parent and the mother's concerns for their child's safety. The mother's fears, while valid, need to be balanced against the child's need for a relationship with both parents. The child's separation anxiety is a concern, but it is not unusual for a child who spends most of their time with one parent.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and the three girls are neighbors in the same apartment building.
2. The girls have been neglecting their responsibility to properly dispose of their trash, causing inconvenience and discomfort to others.
3. The author wrote a strongly worded note to the girls expressing their frustration and urging them to take care of their trash.
4. The girls have since removed their trash.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms. 
1. The girls' behavior of not taking out their trash is non-conforming to the norms of the apartment community, which expects residents to dispose of their trash properly.
2. The author's action of writing a note, although strongly worded, is an attempt to enforce conformity to these norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that the girls were at fault for not conforming to the norms of their community, causing inconvenience to others. The author, despite using strong language, was trying to enforce these norms and ensure a comfortable living environment for all residents. The girls' subsequent action of removing their trash indicates that they have now conformed to the expected behavior.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that the girls were initially at fault for not conforming to the norms of their community, but the author's strongly worded note, although harsh, was an attempt to enforce these norms. The girls have since conformed to the expected behavior by removing their trash.

The value in question is 'Conformity'. Conformity implies adhering to social norms or expectations. In this context, it could be seen as the expectation to be honest and transparent in relationships, including online friendships.

Based on the principles of honesty and transparency inherent in the value of conformity, the author would be ethically in the wrong to hide their previous identity. However, it's also important to consider the context of online gaming, where identities can be fluid and the focus is often more on the present interaction than past histories. The author's intention to be a better person and their need for friendship also add complexity to the situation.

3. The children often come to the author's house without pants on and with visibly wet nappies.
4. The author is uncomfortable with this and asks the children to either put on pants or play outside.
5. The author is considering whether to confront the neighbor about toilet training her children.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms. 
1. The neighbor's children are not conforming to the societal norm of being toilet trained at their age.
2. The author is uncomfortable with the children's non-conformity and is considering whether to enforce conformity by confronting the neighbor.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, the author is not wrong to feel uncomfortable with the situation. It is a societal norm for children of the neighbor's children's age to be toilet trained. The author is also within their rights to enforce rules in their own home, such as requiring the children to wear pants. However, the decision to confront the neighbor should be based on the principle of respect for others' parenting choices, balanced against the potential harm to the children from not being toilet trained.

Step 4: The author is not at fault for feeling uncomfortable with the neighbor's children's lack of toilet training and for wanting to enforce norms in their own home. However, the decision to confront the neighbor should be made with care, considering the principle of respect for others' parenting choices and the potential harm to the children.

1. The mother distributed family heirlooms to her grandchildren without knowing their monetary value.
2. The son's heirloom was appraised at $75,000.
3. The daughter's heirloom has no monetary value.
4. The author suggested the son to sell his heirloom after the grandmother's death and share the proceeds with his sister.
5. The son is unhappy with this suggestion, citing his sister's better financial situation.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics.
2. The mother's distribution of heirlooms was not based on their monetary value, but on sentiment and tradition, conforming to the family's norms.
3. The author's suggestion for the son to share the proceeds of the heirloom sale with his sister also conforms to a norm of fairness and equality within the family.
4. The son's resistance to this suggestion could be seen as non-conformity to these family norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The mother's distribution of heirlooms was in line with family traditions and norms, and she was unaware of the monetary value of the items. The author's suggestion for the son to share the proceeds of the heirloom sale with his sister is also in line with a norm of fairness and equality. The son's resistance to this suggestion, based on his sister's better financial situation, is a deviation from these norms. However, his feelings are understandable given his own financial situation.

3. The author had a drunken hookup with this friend before he was dating his girlfriend.
4. The author and the friend have no romantic feelings towards each other.
5. The friend is in a committed relationship.
6. The author, his girlfriend, the friend, and the friend's boyfriend are all friends and trust each other.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms.
2. The author's decision to go on the trip despite his girlfriend's discomfort does not conform to the norm of respecting a partner's feelings in a relationship.
3. The author's belief that there are no feelings between him and the friend, and that they all trust each other, is in conflict with the girlfriend's discomfort.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of conformity, the author's decision to go on the trip despite his girlfriend's discomfort is not in line with the norm of respecting a partner's feelings in a relationship. Even though the author and the friend have no feelings for each other and trust each other, the girlfriend's discomfort should have been taken into account. Therefore, the author's actions do not conform to the expected behavior in a relationship.
</step_3>

The author is at fault for not conforming to the norms of respecting a partner's feelings in a relationship. Despite the trust and lack of feelings between the author and the friend, the girlfriend's discomfort should have been considered.

3. The decrease in physical attraction allowed the author to focus more on the girl's personality.
4. The author finds the girl's personality uninteresting and wants to distance himself.
5. The author feels guilty about his feelings and actions.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to coincide with a group standard.
2. The author's initial attraction to the girl was based on her physical appearance, which is a common societal standard.
3. The girl's decision to change her appearance is a deviation from societal norms, which led to the author's decreased attraction.
4. The author's decision to distance himself due to lack of interest in the girl's personality is not necessarily a matter of conformity, but personal preference.

<step_3>
The author's initial attraction was based on physical appearance, a societal norm. The girl's change in appearance, a deviation from the norm, led to decreased attraction. The author's decision to distance himself due to lack of interest in her personality is a personal preference, not a matter of conformity. The author's guilt may stem from societal expectations to maintain friendships regardless of personal feelings.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author hung out with a female friend while his girlfriend was out of town.
2. The author did not inform his girlfriend about this due to her trust issues.
3. The female friend's boyfriend was present during their hangout.
4. The author's girlfriend went through his text messages without his knowledge.
5. Upon discovering the hangout, the girlfriend confessed to cheating on the author with a coworker.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which implies adhering to social norms or expectations. 
1. The author's action of hanging out with a female friend, while not informing his girlfriend, can be seen as non-conformity to the expectation of transparency in a relationship.
2. The girlfriend's action of going through the author's text messages without his knowledge is a breach of privacy, which is non-conformity to the norm of respecting personal boundaries.
3. The girlfriend's act of cheating is a clear non-conformity to the expectation of fidelity in a relationship.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's decision to not inform his girlfriend about the hangout can be seen as a minor breach of trust, but it does not justify the girlfriend's actions of violating his privacy and cheating. The girlfriend's actions are a clear violation of the norms of respect, trust, and fidelity in a relationship.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that while the author may have made a minor mistake by not informing his girlfriend about the hangout, the girlfriend's actions of violating his privacy and cheating are far more serious breaches of trust and conformity to relationship norms.

2. The author's friends praised his work and offered some criticisms.
3. The author explicitly asked his friends to tell him if his work was awful.
4. The author's professor, an experienced writer, gave the author's work a poor review, contradicting the friends' feedback.
5. The author feels betrayed by his friends, believing they lied to him.
6. The author values honesty above all else and is considering ending his friendship over this perceived dishonesty.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The author's expectation of honesty from his friends aligns with the value of conformity, as he expects them to conform to his standards of truthfulness.
2. The friends' feedback, whether it was honest or not, did not conform to the professional evaluation of the professor.
3. The author's reaction to the perceived dishonesty shows a strong adherence to his personal values, which includes conformity to honesty.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's friends may have genuinely believed their feedback was accurate, or they may have been trying to spare the author's feelings. The author's expectation of honesty, while valid, may not have been fully understood or shared by his friends. The professor's feedback, while harsh, is a professional opinion and may not reflect the subjective views of the friends.

3. The author is choosing not to conform to this expectation due to his personal feelings and experiences.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author is not conforming to the expectations of his social group, choosing instead to prioritize his personal feelings and experiences. This is a logical decision based on the best friend's history of inappropriate behavior and the author's personal feelings of betrayal. The author has forgiven the best friend but does not wish to be around him, which is a reasonable response given the circumstances.

1. The author and his wife own a house and rent out the top part to a tenant with a poodle.
2. The tenant pays additional pet rent and a deposit to account for potential damage caused by the dog.
3. The tenant does not seem to take good care of the dog, leaving it in a kennel for long hours and outside in cold weather.
4. The dog has started to escape through a small gate on the side of the house.
5. The tenant insists that the author replace the gate to keep the dog safe.
6. The author believes it's the tenant's responsibility to ensure the dog's safety and well-being.
7. The tenant has threatened that there will be a problem if the dog goes missing.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or standards.
2. The author and his wife, as landlords, are conforming to their responsibilities by maintaining the property and addressing issues brought up by the tenant.
3. The tenant, however, is not conforming to the norms of responsible pet ownership by neglecting the dog's needs and well-being.
4. The tenant's demand for the author to replace the gate is an attempt to shift her responsibilities onto the author.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it can be concluded that the author is not at fault for taking his time to replace the gate. The tenant, as the dog's owner, should conform to the norms of responsible pet ownership, which includes ensuring the dog's safety and well-being. The pet rent and deposit are meant to cover potential property damage, not to absolve the tenant of her responsibilities towards her pet. The tenant's threats and aggressive behavior further indicate a lack of conformity to norms of respectful communication and negotiation.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author, as a landlord, is fulfilling his responsibilities and conforming to norms. The tenant, however, is not conforming to the norms of responsible pet ownership and respectful communication. Therefore, the tenant is at fault for the situation.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author and the girl were having a conversation about makeup.
2. The author expressed his preference for natural looks over makeup.
3. The girl expressed her enjoyment of wearing makeup and stated that she wears it for herself, not for men.
4. The author continued to insist that men prefer the ""authentic"" look, implying that makeup is a ""gimmick"".
5. The girl decided to end the conversation and potentially the relationship because she felt the author was not respecting her choices.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario can be seen in the author's belief that men generally prefer women without makeup, and his insistence on this belief despite the girl's clear statement that she wears makeup for herself. The girl, on the other hand, is not conforming to the author's belief and is asserting her individuality and personal preference.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author was not respecting the girl's individuality and personal preference, insisting on his belief that men prefer women without makeup. This insistence, despite the girl's clear statement that she wears makeup for herself, shows a lack of understanding and respect for her choices. The girl, in turn, decided to end the conversation and potentially the relationship because she felt the author was not respecting her choices.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that the author was at fault for not respecting the girl's individuality and personal preference, insisting on his belief despite her clear statements. This lack of respect led to the end of the conversation and potentially the relationship.

7. The author didn't voice his disagreement.
8. The author is left with half the money and everyone is mad at him.

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to coincide with a group standard.
2. The author's reaction to his sister's complaints deviates from the expected behavior, which might be empathy or silence.
3. The mother's decision to split the money also deviates from the norm, as the money was given specifically to the author by the grandfather.
4. The sister's annual complaints could be seen as non-conformity, as she continues to express her dissatisfaction despite the pattern being established.
</step_2>

<step_3>
1. The author's reaction to his sister's complaints, while lacking empathy, was not inherently wrong. He expressed his frustration at the recurring situation.
2. The mother's decision to split the money, while well-intentioned, overstepped her boundaries as the money was given specifically to the author.
3. The sister's complaints, while understandable, do not change the situation and only serve to create tension.
4. The grandfather's decision to only give money to the author, while within his rights, contributes to the tension.

1. The author did not conform to a standard or expectation that names should not be potentially offensive or racially insensitive.
2. The girlfriend is advocating for conformity to social norms regarding racial sensitivity.

<step_3>
The author's intention was not to be racist but to name the cat after a dish they presumably like. However, the girlfriend perceives the name as racially insensitive. The principle of conformity would suggest that the author should respect the social norm of avoiding potentially offensive or racially insensitive names. However, it's also important to consider the principle of intent versus impact. The author's intent was not to offend, but the impact is that the girlfriend is upset.

3. The author's friend believes that the author's desire to travel alone indicates a lack of love for her boyfriend.
4. The author believes in the strength of a non-co-dependent relationship.
5. The friend's opinion is causing strain on the author's friendship and causing her to question her relationship.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' suggests adhering to social norms or expectations.

Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it can be concluded that the friend is imposing her own beliefs and expectations onto the author's relationship. The author's boyfriend has expressed support for her travel plans, indicating that he respects her individuality and need for personal growth. The friend's insistence that the author's desire to travel alone indicates a lack of love for her boyfriend is an assumption, not a principle. It is also important to note that the author's belief in non-co-dependent relationships is a valid perspective and does not necessarily indicate a lack of love or commitment.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The friend's insistence on conformity to her own beliefs about relationships is causing unnecessary strain on the author's friendship and relationship. The author's boyfriend has expressed support for her travel plans, and the author's belief in non-co-dependent relationships is a valid perspective. Therefore, the friend's assumptions are causing the conflict, not the author's actions or beliefs.

1. The author's friend, Jim, expressed interest in the girlfriend's friend.
2. The girlfriend asked the author to compare her physical attractiveness to her friend's.
3. The author initially resisted answering but eventually complied with the girlfriend's insistence for honesty.
4. The author's honesty upset the girlfriend, leading to her crying and asking the author to leave.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard or expectation.
2. The girlfriend expected the author to conform to the societal norm of reassuring a partner about their attractiveness, despite her insistence on honesty.
3. The author, instead of conforming to this expectation, chose to be honest as per the girlfriend's request.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author was placed in a difficult situation where he was asked to be honest, but the expectation was that he would conform to the societal norm of reassuring his partner. He chose honesty over conformity, which upset his girlfriend. However, he was following her explicit request for honesty. 
</step_3>

Based on this reasoning, the author is not at fault. He was asked to be honest and he was. The girlfriend's reaction, while understandable, does not make the author at fault as he was following her explicit request.

2. In this scenario, the group is the family unit, and the standard is set by the author who wants peace and appropriate content for their child.
3. The husband's behavior of playing loud, explicit music does not conform to this standard.
4. The author's repeated requests for change indicate a desire for conformity to a peaceful and child-appropriate environment.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the husband's behavior is not conforming to the standards set by the author for the family environment. Despite being communicated about the issue multiple times, he continues his behavior, showing a lack of respect for the author's concerns and the family standards. The author's reaction is not an overreaction but a response to the husband's non-conformity and disregard for the family's well-being.
</step_3>

Step 4: The husband's repeated disregard for the author's concerns and the family standards, despite being communicated multiple times, shows a lack of conformity. The author's frustration is a response to this non-conformity and is not an overreaction.

—My Dad is a very difficult person to live with and miserable to be around. 
—He only talks to me only when he wants to criticize or pu...",Other,Other,1.0,1.0,True,"<step_1>
The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author's father is consistently abusive, both emotionally and physically.
2. The author's father has unrealistic expectations and is never satisfied.
3. The author's father has a history of violence towards the author's mother.
4. The author's father tries to control the author's life and decisions.
5. The author has stood up to his father's abusive behavior.
6. The author is considering cutting contact with his father.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' suggests adhering to social norms or standards. In this context, it could mean maintaining family ties despite the difficulties. However, the father's behavior is not conforming to the societal norms of respect, love, and care within a family. The author's decision to cut contact is a deviation from the norm of maintaining family ties, but it is in response to the father's non-conformity to basic human decency and respect.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's decision to cut contact with his father is a response to ongoing abuse and disrespect. While it may not conform to societal expectations of maintaining family ties, it is a necessary step for the author's mental and emotional well-being. The father's abusive behavior is not justified by his difficult childhood. The author is not at fault for wanting to protect himself and his family from further harm.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's decision to cut contact with his father, while not conforming to societal norms, is a necessary response to ongoing abuse. The father's behavior is the root cause of this situation, and the author is not at fault for wanting to protect himself and his family.

2. Ned was monopolizing the bin by taking all non-land cards and intercepting new additions before they reached the bin.
3. The author took some cards from Ned's stack, which Ned considered his own.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms.
2. The norm in this scenario was that the bin was for community use, and cards should be freely available to all.
3. Ned's actions were not conforming to this norm, as he was monopolizing the cards.
4. The author's actions were also not conforming to the norm, as he took cards from Ned's stack without Ned's consent.

She enjoys reading and drama, and has friends but doesn’t like to spend too much ...",Author,Everybody,0.8,0.9473684210526315,True,"<step_1>
1. The author's daughter is 10 years old and enjoys perfecting odd body movements.
2. The author is uncomfortable with some of these movements, particularly the one where the daughter covers her nostrils with her upper lip.
3. The author's sister and mother also perform this movement, and the daughter learned it from them.
4. The author has told the daughter to stop performing this movement and has threatened punishment if she continues.
5. The author's sister accuses the author of stifling the daughter's creativity.
6. The author believes these movements have no positive benefits and could potentially harm the daughter's joints.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests that individuals should adhere to societal norms and expectations.
2. The author's discomfort with the daughter's movements stems from a perceived lack of conformity to what they consider normal or attractive.
3. The daughter's actions, while unusual, do not conform to the author's expectations of what a child should be interested in or spend time practicing.
4. The author's sister's accusation suggests a conflict between the value of conformity and the value of individual creativity and expression.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's desire for the daughter to conform to societal norms and expectations is in conflict with the daughter's desire to express herself creatively through unusual body movements. The author's concern about potential harm to the daughter's joints is valid, but there is no evidence provided that these movements are causing harm. The author's attempt to control the daughter's actions could be seen as stifling her creativity, as the sister suggests. However, the author also has a responsibility to guide the daughter and ensure her safety. 
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's desire for conformity is in conflict with the daughter's creative expression. While the author's concern for the daughter's safety is valid, there is no evidence of harm. The author's attempt to control the daughter's actions could be seen as stifling her creativity.

1. The author has been dating Charles for over a year and has developed a close relationship with his brother, David.
2. David started dating Abby, who the author finds rude and off-putting.
3. Abby's behavior has caused discomfort and inconvenience to the author and Charles.
4. The author and Charles have started avoiding double dates with David and Abby.
5. David has noticed the avoidance and the author feels guilty for potentially causing a problem.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of 'Conformity' suggests that individuals should act in a way that aligns with societal norms and expectations.
2. Abby's behavior, as described by the author, does not conform to typical social etiquette, such as respecting others' opinions, not interrupting, and not imposing her preferences on others.
3. The author and Charles' decision to avoid double dates with David and Abby is a response to Abby's non-conformity.
4. The author's guilt over potentially causing a problem suggests a desire to conform to the expectation of maintaining harmony in relationships.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of conformity, Abby's behavior is non-conforming and disruptive, causing discomfort to the author and Charles. The author's response to avoid double dates is a reaction to this non-conformity. The author's guilt, however, suggests a conflict between the desire to avoid discomfort and the societal expectation to maintain harmony in relationships. The author is not at fault for wanting to avoid an uncomfortable situation, but could potentially address the issue directly with David to maintain the relationship.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The peer is expressing feelings of depression openly in class.
2. The peer is seeking attention and sympathy from others.
3. The author responds to the peer's behavior with hostility and derogatory language.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' implies adhering to social norms and expectations. In this scenario:
1. The peer's behavior of openly expressing depression and seeking attention deviates from typical classroom behavior, thus not conforming.
2. The author's response, while also not conforming to expected respectful communication, is an attempt to enforce social norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, both the peer and the author are not conforming to expected behaviors. The peer's open expression of depression and attention-seeking behavior is not typical in a classroom setting. However, the author's response is also inappropriate and disrespectful, which is not an acceptable way of enforcing conformity.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that both the peer and the author are at fault. The peer for disrupting the class with personal issues and the author for responding in a disrespectful and derogatory manner.

3. The author has lost a significant amount of weight and feels healthier since moving out.
4. The author believes their mother may be sabotaging their healthy eating habits.
5. The author has started throwing away the food they do not want.
</step_1>

The value in question here is 'Conformity'. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard. In this case, the author is not conforming to their mother's expectations or habits of giving them food they do not want or need. Instead, they are conforming to a healthier lifestyle that they have chosen for themselves.

7. The author had a brief interaction with the ex-stepdad at her brother's wedding.
8. The author and the ex-stepdad had a conversation on social media after the wedding.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics.
2. The author's relationship with her ex-stepdad does not conform to traditional familial norms due to the divorce and subsequent remarriage.
3. The ex-stepdad's behavior of excluding the author and her sister from his home after remarriage does not conform to the expected behavior of a father figure.
4. The author's decision to maintain distance from the ex-stepdad and not pursue a deeper relationship also deviates from the norm of seeking close familial bonds.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles identified, the ex-stepdad's actions of excluding the author and her sister from his life after remarriage are not in line with the value of conformity, as they deviate from the expected behavior of a father figure. The author's decision to maintain distance also deviates from the norm, but it seems to be a response to the ex-stepdad's actions rather than an independent choice.

2. The friend started dating a new girl two weeks after moving in.
3. The friend moved out five months later without informing the author.
4. The friend left his belongings, including a TV and guns, at the author's house.
5. The author, uncomfortable with guns due to personal reasons, asked the friend to remove them.
6. The friend eventually removed the guns but left the TV.
7. Eight months later, the author told the friend's ex (the original owner of the TV) that she could take the TV.
8. The friend's current girlfriend demanded the TV three months later.
9. The friend and his girlfriend accused the author of giving away the friend's stuff and the ex of stealing.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of conformity implies adhering to social norms or rules. In this scenario, the friend did not conform to the social norms of communication and respect for personal space when he moved out without informing the author and left his belongings behind. The author, on the other hand, conformed to the social norm of returning property to its original owner when he gave the TV back to the friend's ex.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of respect for personal space and property, the friend is at fault for leaving his belongings at the author's house without permission or notice. The author acted within his rights to return the TV to its original owner after the friend abandoned it. The friend's lack of communication and disregard for the author's comfort (leaving guns in the house of a suicide survivor) further supports this conclusion.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that the friend violated the principles of respect for personal space and property, and the author acted within his rights to return the TV to its original owner. The friend's lack of communication and disregard for the author's comfort further supports this conclusion.

1. The author is a 14-year-old male who values his future career over immediate fun.
2. The author's friend, Ben, is a 15-year-old male who enjoys using his wealth for entertainment.
3. The author had initially agreed to spend the summer with Ben, assuming he wouldn't get an internship.
4. The author received a late offer for an internship and accepted it, canceling his plans with Ben.
5. Ben is upset about the author's decision.
6. The author believes that this internship, even if it involves menial tasks, could lead to better opportunities in the future.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of 'Conformity' suggests adhering to social norms or expectations.
2. The author's decision to prioritize his career over leisure time with his friend goes against the typical teenage behavior, thus not conforming.
3. Ben's reaction, being upset, aligns with the expectation of a friend who had plans canceled on him, thus conforming.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's decision to prioritize his career over leisure time, while not conforming to typical teenage behavior, is a personal choice that aligns with his long-term goals. Ben's reaction is understandable and conforms to social expectations. However, the author's non-conformity in this scenario is not inherently wrong, as it is driven by his personal values and future aspirations.

1. The author is of Indian origin and has a close friend, Jenn, who was born in India but was adopted by a white family when she was 2 years old.
2. Jenn was not raised in Indian culture and has limited knowledge about it.
3. Jenn is planning to incorporate many Indian Hindu style elements into her wedding, despite her limited understanding of the culture.
4. The author feels uncomfortable with Jenn's approach and has expressed her concerns to Jenn.
5. Jenn reacted negatively to the author's feedback and has since cut off communication.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value in question is 'Conformity', which implies adhering to a certain set of norms or traditions.
2. Jenn is not conforming to the culture she was raised in, but is instead trying to incorporate elements of a culture she has limited understanding of.
3. The author believes Jenn's approach is not conforming to the true essence of Indian culture and traditions.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it can be concluded that Jenn's approach to her wedding may not be conforming to the true essence of Indian culture due to her limited understanding. However, it's also important to note that Jenn's intention is to connect with her roots, which is a personal and subjective matter. The author's concern is valid from the perspective of preserving the authenticity of the culture, but it could have been communicated in a more supportive and understanding manner.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The author's concern about Jenn's approach to her wedding is valid from the perspective of cultural authenticity and conformity. However, the way the concern was communicated could have been more supportive and understanding, considering Jenn's intention to connect with her roots. Jenn's reaction, while emotional, is also understandable given the personal nature of the matter.

1. The author's friend has a romantic interest in a girl and is experiencing depression related to this.
2. The author and their friends attempted to help by directly messaging the girl to encourage her to message the friend.
3. This action upset the girl and the author believes it may have negatively impacted their friend's chances with her.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of 'Conformity' suggests adhering to social norms and accepted behaviors.
2. The author and their friends' action of directly intervening in their friend's romantic interest does not conform to typical social norms, which usually respect individual's privacy in such matters.
3. The girl's reaction of being upset could be seen as a response to this breach of social norms.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of conformity, the author and their friends' actions were inappropriate as they breached social norms of privacy and individual agency in romantic matters. Their intentions may have been good, but the method was not in line with accepted social behavior. This could have led to the negative outcome, causing distress to both the girl and their friend.

6. P. continued to make advances towards the author, even in front of A.
7. The author feels uncomfortable with P.'s behavior and is considering cutting off contact again.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to match those of other people or societal norms.
2. The author has tried to conform to societal norms by being supportive of P.'s coming out and trying to maintain a friendship despite P.'s inappropriate behavior.
3. P. has not conformed to societal norms or respected the author's boundaries, continuing to make advances despite the author's clear communication that he is not interested.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of respect for personal boundaries and conformity to societal norms, P. is at fault for not respecting the author's boundaries and continuing to make advances despite clear communication that they are unwanted. The author has tried to conform to societal norms by being supportive and understanding, but P.'s behavior has made this difficult. The author is not at fault for wanting to cut off contact with someone who consistently makes him uncomfortable and disrespects his boundaries.
</step_3>

The logical conclusion is that P. is at fault for not respecting the author's boundaries and continuing to make advances despite clear communication that they are unwanted. The author has tried to conform to societal norms by being supportive and understanding, but P.'s behavior has made this difficult.

3. The driver of the SUV appeared to be under the influence of alcohol.
4. The driver of the SUV asked the author to claim responsibility for the accident.
5. The author refused to claim responsibility but offered to drive the SUV driver away from the scene.
6. The author drove the SUV driver a few exits away from the accident scene.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity implies adhering to societal norms and laws.
2. The author did not conform to the societal norm of reporting a drunk driver to the authorities.
3. The author did conform to the societal norm of helping someone in need.
4. The SUV driver did not conform to societal norms and laws by driving under the influence and asking someone else to take responsibility for his actions.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author acted in a way that both conformed and did not conform to societal norms. They helped someone in need, which is generally seen as a positive action. However, they also helped a potentially drunk driver avoid legal consequences, which goes against societal norms and laws. The SUV driver clearly did not conform to societal norms and laws by driving under the influence and attempting to evade responsibility for his actions.
</step_3>

The author's actions are ethically ambiguous. While they did help someone in need, they also potentially enabled dangerous behavior by helping the driver avoid legal consequences. The SUV driver, on the other hand, clearly acted in a way that is both illegal and dangerous.

6. The author is questioning whether he should have lied to avoid hurting his girlfriend's feelings.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the author did not conform to the societal norm of complimenting a partner's looks, instead choosing to be honest about his assessment. His girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to conform to the societal expectation of wanting to be seen as attractive by her partner.
</step_2>

Based on the principles, the author's honesty, while it may have been hurtful, was not unethical. He chose to be truthful rather than conform to societal norms. However, his approach could have been more tactful, focusing on aspects he finds attractive rather than giving a numerical rating. His girlfriend's reaction is understandable as she conforms to societal expectations of desiring to be seen as attractive.

6. The author's parents have announced they are expecting another child.
7. The author is not enthusiastic about this news and is choosing to distance himself from the situation.

The value of 'Conformity' refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario:
1. The author's parents are not conforming to societal norms of family planning and financial stability before having another child.
2. The author is not conforming to the expected reaction of joy and support upon hearing the news of a new sibling.

Based on the principles, the author is not obligated to conform to societal expectations of being enthusiastic about a new sibling, especially given his concerns about his parents' financial stability and relationship. His parents, on the other hand, are not conforming to societal norms of responsible family planning. However, their decision to have another child is their personal choice, and they are not obligated to conform to societal norms either.

4. The author's mother used to remind them to wear seatbelts during these episodes.
5. The author is willing to risk her life to make her father realize the consequences of his actions.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard.
2. The father's behavior does not conform to safe driving standards or norms of respectful communication.
3. The author's refusal to wear a seatbelt is a non-conformist action, taken in response to her father's non-conformist (and dangerous) behavior.
4. The mother's reminders to wear seatbelts can be seen as an attempt to enforce conformity to safety norms.

Based on the principle of conformity, the friend's girlfriend should contribute to the rent as she is a resident of the apartment. The author has made efforts to conform by paying back owed rent, but still owes two months. The author's consideration to address the issue is a deviation from the norm of avoiding conflict, but it is in pursuit of establishing conformity in the shared living situation. Therefore, it is not inherently wrong.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:

2. The boyfriend enjoys experimenting and replacing things, while the author prefers to maintain and preserve her belongings.
3. The boyfriend drives the author's car in a way that she perceives as reckless and damaging.
4. The boyfriend has offered to replace anything he damages, but the author prefers to avoid damage in the first place.
5. The author wants her boyfriend to respect her approach to material possessions and treat her belongings with more care.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity'. In this context, it refers to the boyfriend's willingness to conform to the author's approach to material possessions. Currently, he is not conforming to her approach, instead treating her belongings in the same way he treats his own. This is causing conflict between them.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it is clear that the boyfriend's lack of conformity to the author's approach to material possessions is causing tension. While he has offered to replace anything he damages, this does not align with the author's preference for preservation over replacement. Therefore, the boyfriend's actions are not respecting the author's values and preferences. However, it is also important to note that the author has not explicitly communicated her feelings to her boyfriend, which is a necessary step in resolving this issue.
</step_3>

Step 4: The boyfriend's lack of conformity to the author's approach to material possessions is causing conflict. His offer to replace damaged items does not align with the author's values. However, the author needs to communicate her feelings clearly to resolve the issue.

6. The author responded by calling his mother self-centered and selfish, and expressing his disappointment about the medicine incident.
7. The author's mother sent a voice message to his daughter, blaming the author and his wife for not letting her see the kids.
</step_1>

3. The author's mother did not conform to the norm of prioritizing family relationships over personal relationships.
4. The author's mother did not conform to the norm of showing concern for a sick child.

3. The author values honesty, responsibility, and respect, which they feel their aunt and mother have not shown.
4. The author is questioning whether their decision to cut ties is ethically correct.

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' suggests adhering to social norms or expectations. In this case, the societal expectation might be to maintain familial relationships despite their flaws. However, the author's experiences with their aunt and mother have been negative and harmful, leading them to break away from this norm for their own well-being.

Based on the principles of personal well-being and respect for oneself, the author's decision to cut ties with their aunt and mother is logically sound. They have made this decision based on repeated negative experiences and the lack of change in their aunt's and mother's behavior. While this may not conform to societal expectations of maintaining family ties, it is a decision made in the interest of their own mental and emotional health.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that the author's decision to cut ties with their aunt and mother, while not conforming to societal expectations, is justified based on their personal experiences and the principle of self-respect and well-being.

Within a group of friends of mine...",Other,Nobody,0.9,0.5,False,"<step_1>
The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author is part of a group of friends that includes Mike, who is perceived as strange and distant.
2. Mike seems to have fewer friends outside this group.
3. The author and the group continue to hang out with Mike despite not being close to him.
4. Mike sometimes acts as if they are all best friends, but also often appears disinterested and distant.
5. The author mentally agrees with friends that Mike is a bit weird but defends him in conversations.
6. The author feels conflicted about their behavior towards Mike.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity'. 
1. The author and their friends conform to the social norm of including Mike in their group despite not being close to him.
2. Mike does not conform to the group's expectations of participation and closeness.
3. The author conforms to the ethical norm of not talking about people behind their backs by defending Mike.
4. The author's mental agreement with friends about Mike's weirdness is a form of conformity to the group's opinion.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author is not at fault for having personal thoughts about Mike being a bit weird, as it is a subjective perception. The author is also not at fault for defending Mike in conversations, as it aligns with the ethical norm of not talking about people behind their backs. However, the author's internal conflict arises from the discrepancy between their personal thoughts and their outward behavior, which is a personal issue rather than an ethical one. Mike's behavior of being distant and not fully participating in the group does not conform to the group's expectations, but it is not ethically wrong. 
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's internal conflict arises from their personal thoughts about Mike and their outward behavior, which is a personal issue rather than an ethical one. Mike's behavior of being distant and not fully participating in the group does not conform to the group's expectations, but it is not ethically wrong.

1. The author's daughter wants to change her last name to include both parents' last names.
2. The law where they live allows for this change.
3. The other parent supports this change.
4. The author has refused to sign the name change application for a year or two.
5. The author has no rational argument for this decision, only a vague feeling that the daughter is too young.
6. The author does not believe this decision would harm the daughter, even if she later regrets it.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics.
2. The daughter's desire to include both parents' last names could be seen as a desire to conform to a norm where both parents are recognized in her name.
3. The author's refusal to sign the application, despite the other parent's support and the daughter's desire, could be seen as non-conformity to this norm.
4. The author's lack of a rational argument for their decision suggests they may be acting out of personal preference rather than conforming to a specific norm or principle.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, the author's refusal to sign the name change application appears to be a personal preference rather than a decision based on a specific norm or principle. The daughter's desire to include both parents' last names and the other parent's support for this change suggest a norm of recognizing both parents in the child's name. The author's decision not to conform to this norm, despite having no rational argument against it and not believing it would harm the daughter, could be seen as prioritizing personal preference over conformity.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author's sister consistently insults him.
2. The author retaliates by doing small things to annoy her.
3. The author unplugged his sister's PlayStation during an update, causing a problem.
4. The author's family is upset with him for his actions and is discussing his ""issues"".
5. The author feels justified in his actions due to the constant insults.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity'. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with group norms or expectations. In this scenario, the author is not conforming to the expected behavior of respecting his sister's belongings. His sister is also not conforming to the expected behavior of treating her sibling with respect. The family's reaction to the author's actions indicates that they expect him to conform to certain standards of behavior, which he is not meeting.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, it can be concluded that both the author and his sister are not conforming to expected norms of behavior. The author's sister's constant insults are not respectful or kind, and the author's retaliation by messing with her belongings is also not respectful. The family's reaction indicates that they expect the author to conform to certain standards of behavior, which he is not meeting. However, it seems that the sister's behavior is not being addressed, which could be contributing to the ongoing issue.

3. The author has been disposing of recyclables in the trash chute for years.
4. The author's guests criticized him for not recycling.
5. The author asked the building manager for a more convenient recycling method but was told no.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which implies adhering to a standard or rule. In this case, the standard is the building's recycling policy, which the author is not following. Instead, he is disposing of recyclables in the trash chute, which is against the building's rules.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of 'Conformity', the author is not conforming to the recycling policy of the building. Despite the inconvenience, the policy is in place for a reason, likely to promote environmental sustainability. The author's actions are in direct violation of this policy, and thus, he is not conforming to the established rules.
</step_3>

The author is at fault for not adhering to the recycling policy of the building, despite its inconvenience. While the building management could potentially make the process more convenient, the author still has a responsibility to follow the rules as they currently exist.

3. However, the author's behavior does conform to their own standard of needing advance notice.
4. The coworker's lack of specificity about the reason for needing the shift covered does not conform to the author's expectation of transparency.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author is not at fault for refusing to cover the shift. They have a personal standard of needing advance notice, which was not met. The coworker's lack of transparency about the reason for needing the shift covered does not meet the author's expectation.

2. The author has tried to support their partner but has been met with hostility or apathy.
3. The partner refuses to see a therapist.
4. The author wants to express their unhappiness and ask their partner to consider therapy.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this context refers to the adherence to social norms or standards.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author is emotionally distressed due to a recent romantic disappointment.
2. The author chose to share their feelings in a group chat.
3. The author's friends in the chat responded with empathy and advice.
4. The author rejected the advice, stating they were aware of the risks they took and preferred to handle their feelings in their own way.
5. The author's friends respected their wishes and returned to their previous conversation.
6. The author felt misunderstood and further explained their position.
7. One of the friends explained their intention was to help, but felt their advice was negatively received.
8. The author did not respond further.
</step_1>

<step_2>

1. The author did not conform to the typical expectation of accepting advice when sharing personal problems in a group setting.
2. The friends initially conformed to the norm of providing advice and empathy when a friend shares a personal problem.
3. After the author's rejection of advice, the friends conformed to the author's request and stopped offering advice.
4. The author's further explanation of their feelings could be seen as a desire for their friends to conform to their way of handling emotional distress.
5. The friend's final response indicates a desire for the author to conform to the norm of accepting advice in a positive manner.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that:
1. The author's rejection of advice and preference for handling their feelings in their own way is a deviation from the norm, thus not conforming.
2. The friends initially conformed to the norm of providing advice when a friend shares a personal problem, but later conformed to the author's request to not offer advice.
3. The tension in this scenario arises from differing expectations of conformity - the author's expectation of their friends to conform to their way of handling emotional distress, and the friend's expectation of the author to conform to the norm of accepting advice in a positive manner.

3. The author shared a personal anecdote about their past living situation, revealing Rebecca's political affiliation.
4. Rebecca felt ""humiliated and isolated"" by this revelation.
5. The school they attend is predominantly liberal.
6. Rebecca is a political science major and is not secretive about her conservative ideals.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests that individuals should behave in a way that aligns with the norms and expectations of their group or society.
2. The author's action of revealing Rebecca's political affiliation in a predominantly liberal environment could be seen as non-conformity, as it goes against the norm of respecting others' privacy.
3. Rebecca's conservative ideals in a predominantly liberal environment also represent non-conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author, while not intending to cause harm, did not respect Rebecca's privacy by revealing her political affiliation without her explicit consent. This action goes against the value of conformity, which respects the norms of privacy and consent. However, Rebecca, despite feeling humiliated and isolated, is not secretive about her conservative ideals, which suggests she is comfortable with non-conformity to some extent.

7. The girl and her roommate accused the author of overreacting and ruining the party.
8. The girl argued that she did nothing wrong as they had never agreed to be exclusive.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard.
2. The author's assumption of exclusivity may have been based on societal norms or expectations of what a relationship should look like after spending a certain amount of time together.
3. The girl's behavior at the party, showing affection to both the author and Bob, does not conform to typical expectations of exclusivity in a relationship.
4. The author's reaction, leaving the party and ending the relationship, conforms to a common response to perceived betrayal.
5. The girl and her roommate's accusations towards the author conform to a defensive response when one's actions are criticized.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author's assumption of exclusivity, while conforming to societal norms, was not communicated or agreed upon with the girl. The girl's behavior, while not conforming to the author's expectations, was based on her understanding of their undefined relationship. The author's reaction, although harsh, was a response to perceived betrayal. The girl and her roommate's accusations were defensive responses to the author's actions.

5. The author does not wish to reject her Jewish heritage, but wants to avoid the negative social experiences she has had due to her physical appearance.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity is at play in this scenario. The author feels pressure to conform to societal beauty standards to avoid ridicule and improve her social life.
2. Her parents, however, see her desire to change her physical appearance as a rejection of their Jewish heritage, which they value and wish to preserve.
3. The author's desire to conform to societal norms is in conflict with her parents' desire for her to conform to their cultural and religious norms.

The author is not the asshole for wanting to change a physical feature that causes her distress. Her desire to conform to societal beauty standards does not necessarily mean she is rejecting her Jewish heritage.

5. The author has asked his wife to delete some of the songs or rearrange them, which has upset her.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value in question is 'Conformity', which implies agreement or harmony in action or thought.
2. The wife's action of adding songs from the author's playlist to hers can be seen as a form of conformity, as she is aligning her musical choices with his.
3. The author's reaction, however, indicates a desire for individuality and uniqueness in his playlist, which is in conflict with the value of conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the interaction with the value of conformity, it can be concluded that the author values his individuality and uniqueness in his music choices, which he feels is being compromised by his wife's actions. On the other hand, the wife's actions can be seen as an attempt to conform to the author's musical tastes, which she presumably appreciates. The conflict arises from the differing interpretations of the value of conformity in this context.

<step_4>
The author is not wrong for wanting to maintain the uniqueness of his playlist, but neither is the wife for wanting to share in the music that he enjoys. The issue lies in the communication and understanding of each other's perspectives. They need to find a balance between conformity and individuality in their shared interest in music.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author frequently visits the post office at the end of the work day to send out certified mailings.
2. The post office is often busy at this time with up to 15 people in line.
3. Most people in line are waiting to pay for postage or buy stamps.
4. The author's items already have postage on them.
5. The author needs the certified mailing ticket date stamped with the post office stamp.
6. The author can achieve this by walking up to the counter and asking one of the USPS workers for the stamp.
7. This action does not interfere with the clerk's ability to help the customer already at the counter and takes less than 5 seconds to complete.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' implies adhering to social norms, rules, or laws. In this scenario, the social norm would be to wait in line until it's your turn. The author's action of bypassing the line conflicts with this value, even though it does not interfere with the clerk's ability to help the customer already at the counter and takes less than 5 seconds to complete.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's action of bypassing the line conflicts with the value of conformity, which suggests that one should adhere to social norms, rules, or laws. Even though the author's action does not interfere with the clerk's ability to help the customer already at the counter and takes less than 5 seconds to complete, it still goes against the social norm of waiting in line until it's your turn.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that while the author's actions may be efficient and not disruptive to the postal workers, they do not conform to the social norms of waiting one's turn in line. This could potentially cause discomfort or annoyance among other customers who are adhering to the norm.

1. The server owner has created a chat filter that deletes messages containing a specific non-offensive word.
2. The word was banned because it reminds the owner of a ""dark time in his life"".
3. The friends have acknowledged this and agreed to monitor their usage of the word.
4. The owner refuses to remove the ban despite the friends' understanding and promise to be considerate.
5. The friends feel that the owner is abusing his power by monitoring what they say.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of 'Conformity' implies adhering to a standard or rule.
2. The server owner has set a rule (the ban) which he expects others to conform to.
3. The friends have shown willingness to conform to the owner's emotional needs by agreeing to monitor their usage of the word.
4. The owner's refusal to remove the ban despite the friends' willingness to conform to his needs may be seen as an overemphasis on conformity.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The server owner, by creating a rule, expects conformity from his friends. The friends, understanding the owner's emotional distress associated with the word, have agreed to conform to his needs. However, the owner's insistence on the ban, despite the friends' willingness to conform, suggests an overemphasis on conformity. This could be seen as an abuse of power, as the friends feel their freedom of speech is being unnecessarily restricted.
</step_3>

<step_4>
The server owner, while having the right to set rules, may be overstepping by insisting on the ban despite the friends' willingness to respect his emotional needs. The friends, on the other hand, have shown understanding and willingness to conform to the owner's needs. Therefore, the owner's insistence on the ban could be seen as an abuse of power.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author admits to having treated her ex-boyfriend poorly in the past, manipulating him emotionally and financially.
2. The ex-boyfriend still has strong feelings for the author and is emotionally distressed.
3. The author has expressed remorse for her past actions and has made a promise to herself to not repeat such behavior.
4. The author did not encourage or manipulate the ex-boyfriend's emotional outburst in the present scenario.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity', which refers to acting in accordance with established standards, rules, or norms. 
1. The author's past behavior was clearly non-conformist, as it violated basic norms of respect and kindness in a relationship.
2. The author's current behavior, however, seems to conform to more acceptable standards of behavior, as she has expressed remorse and has not encouraged or manipulated her ex-boyfriend's emotional distress.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, it can be concluded that while the author was at fault in the past, she is not directly responsible for her ex-boyfriend's current emotional distress. She has shown remorse for her past actions and has not repeated them in the present scenario. The ex-boyfriend's emotional reaction seems to be a result of unresolved feelings and not a direct consequence of the author's current actions.
</step_3>

The final reasoning is that while the author was at fault in the past for her manipulative behavior, she is not at fault in the present scenario. Her ex-boyfriend's emotional distress is a result of unresolved feelings and not a direct consequence of the author's current actions.

4. The author's plan to fire Cruella without pay does not conform to standard ethical business practices, even if it is legally permissible.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principle of conformity, both the author and Cruella are not adhering to standard business practices. Cruella's insubordination and inefficiency are causing financial loss to the company, which is against the company's norms. The author's plan to fire Cruella without pay, although legally permissible, is not ethically right as it does not conform to standard business practices of treating employees fairly. The uncle's favoritism towards Cruella is also against the norms of fair management.
</step_3>

The author, Cruella, and the uncle are all at fault in this scenario. Cruella for her insubordination and inefficiency, the uncle for his favoritism and lack of action, and the author for planning to fire Cruella without pay.

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to match those of the group or social norms.

3. The author's mother took money that the author was saving for a Kindle and has not returned it.
4. The author's mother has recently made purchases for herself, indicating she has some disposable income.
5. The author is upset about this situation and is considering confronting her mother.
6. The author questions whether the money she receives should be considered family money since she doesn't work for it.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard. In this case, the group is the family.
2. The author's mother's behavior of taking money without asking or returning it does not conform to the standard set by the author's father, who borrows less frequently, apologizes, and returns more than he took.
3. The author's behavior of saving money and considering it her own does not conform to her mother's apparent view of the money as family money.
4. The author's consideration of confronting her mother about the money could be seen as a move towards conformity, as it would be an attempt to establish a shared standard for borrowing and returning money.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the fundamental truths and the value of conformity, it seems that the author and her mother have different views on the nature of the money the author receives and how it should be used. This lack of conformity is causing tension. The author is not at fault for considering the money her own and wanting it to be returned when borrowed, as this is a reasonable expectation. The mother, however, is not conforming to this expectation, which is causing the conflict.

The scenario presents two fundamental truths: 
1. The author believes that diseases like cancer are necessary to control population growth.
2. The author supports China's one-child policy as a measure to prevent overpopulation.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value 'Conformity' refers to the adherence to social norms or standards. 
1. The author's view that diseases are necessary for population control does not conform to the general societal belief that diseases are harmful and should be eradicated.
2. The author's support for China's one-child policy may or may not conform to societal norms, depending on the society in question. In some societies, this policy might be seen as a violation of personal freedoms, while in others, it might be seen as a necessary measure for sustainability.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, the author's views do not conform to the general societal norms regarding disease and population control. While the concern for overpopulation is valid, wishing for diseases to persist as a form of population control is generally seen as unethical. The support for China's one-child policy is subjective and depends on societal norms and values.

The author's views, while potentially stemming from concern for overpopulation, do not conform to general societal norms and values, particularly the belief in the importance of eradicating diseases. Therefore, the author is at fault for expressing views that are generally considered unethical.

4. The author feels overlooked and believes they would also benefit from private school.
5. The parents can afford to send both children to private school but have chosen not to send the author.

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests that individuals should adhere to societal norms or standards.
2. The parents' decision to send the sister to private school is a deviation from the norm, as they are providing different educational opportunities for their children based on their individual needs.
3. The author's desire to also attend private school is in line with the value of conformity, as they wish to receive the same opportunities as their sister.

The parents are making decisions based on the individual needs of their children, which is a logical and ethical approach. The author's feelings of being overlooked are understandable but are based on a desire for equal treatment rather than an assessment of individual needs. The parents' decision to not send the author to private school is not unethical, as they believe the author is already succeeding in their current educational environment.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:

2. The author asked her boyfriend about his whereabouts and company, which he initially avoided answering.
3. The boyfriend eventually told the author that she has no right to know his whereabouts or company, claiming it as his private sphere.
4. The author feels uncomfortable and suspicious about her boyfriend's secrecy.
5. The author respects her boyfriend's need for time with his friends and doesn't mind him being out without her.
6. This is the first time the boyfriend has outright refused to disclose his company to the author.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question here is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. 
1. The author's request for information about her boyfriend's whereabouts and company can be seen as a desire for conformity to the norms of their relationship, which presumably involve open communication and mutual trust.
2. The boyfriend's refusal to disclose his company and location, claiming it as his private sphere, can be seen as a deviation from these norms.
3. The author's discomfort and suspicion arise from this deviation from the expected norms of their relationship.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles identified, the boyfriend's refusal to disclose his whereabouts and company to the author, who he is in a committed relationship with, is a deviation from the norms of open communication and mutual trust in a relationship. This deviation has caused discomfort and suspicion for the author. However, the boyfriend also has a right to privacy and may feel that his personal space is being invaded.

2. The fiance's mother sent a package containing Wisconsin String Cheese.
3. The fiance opened the package and ate one piece of cheese.
4. The author ate most of the remaining cheese without knowing how many pieces were originally in the bag.

6. The author laughed at his fiance's reaction.
7. The fiance has been talking about getting into shape and eating healthy.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario can be interpreted as the expectation that shared resources (in this case, the cheese) should be divided equally or used with mutual consent. The author did not conform to this expectation as he consumed most of the cheese without discussing it with his fiance. His laughter at her anger could also be seen as a lack of conformity to the expectation of empathy in a relationship.

His laughter at his fiance's anger also shows a lack of empathy. However, it's also true that the author was unaware of the original quantity of cheese and his fiance's attachment to it. His actions were not intentionally disrespectful or harmful.

1. The author is suffering from a severe case of mono, which causes extreme fatigue and other health issues.
2. The author's girlfriend wants to spend time with him and her daughter, but the author is worried about his ability to stay awake.
3. The author communicated his concerns to his girlfriend, but she interpreted his reluctance to stay out late as a lack of interest in spending time with her.
4. The author values his health and safety, and is trying to balance this with his desire to spend time with his girlfriend and her daughter.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. The value of conformity suggests that individuals should adhere to societal norms and expectations.
2. In this scenario, the societal expectation might be that the author should prioritize spending time with his girlfriend and her daughter.
3. However, the author's health condition is preventing him from conforming to this expectation.
4. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she may be prioritizing the value of conformity over the author's health.
</step_2>

<step_3>
The author is not being an ""asshole"" for prioritizing his health and safety. His actions are based on a logical concern about his ability to stay awake, not a lack of interest in his girlfriend or her daughter. The girlfriend's reaction may be based on a misunderstanding or lack of knowledge about the severity of the author's condition. It would be beneficial for both parties to have a clear and open discussion about the author's health and how it impacts their plans.

4. Bill is not the type to ask a random girl out.
5. The author is the type to ask a random girl out.
6. The author is considering asking the girl out.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms.
2. The author and Bill have a norm of going to Qdoba together.
3. Bill's attraction to the girl is known to the author.
4. The author's intention to ask the girl out deviates from the norm of their friendship, which is not to interfere with each other's romantic interests.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principle of conformity, the author asking the girl out would be a deviation from the established norms of their friendship. This could potentially cause conflict or discomfort between the author and Bill. However, it's also important to note that Bill's inability to ask the girl out doesn't necessarily grant him exclusive rights to her. The girl also has a say in who she wants to date. 
</step_3>

<step_4>
The author would not be adhering to the principle of conformity if he asks the girl out, as it could potentially disrupt the established norms of their friendship. However, the girl's preferences also matter in this situation. It would be best for the author to discuss his intentions with Bill before proceeding.

Anyway, in my shop...",Author,Author,0.9,0.9333333333333333,True,"<step_1>
1. The author attends a vocational high school where every student is supplied with an iPad.
2. There is a student named Steven who is a fan of anime and often watches it on his iPad during class, missing valuable information.
3. Steven has a unique personality and demands to be called by different names.
4. The author is easily irritated and has been giving Steven a hard time due to his behavior.
5. The author has recently realized that Steven might be on the autism spectrum and has survived cancer.
6. The author feels guilty about his actions towards Steven.
</step_1>

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to align with a group standard.
2. Steven does not conform to the typical behavior expected in a vocational class setting, as he watches anime during class and demands to be called by different names.
3. The author, along with others, has been giving Steven a hard time for his non-conformity.
4. The author's actions towards Steven do not align with the value of conformity, as he has been punishing Steven for his non-conformity rather than trying to understand or accommodate his differences.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles of conformity, it is clear that Steven's behavior deviates from the norm, which has led to negative reactions from his peers, including the author. However, the author's actions towards Steven, especially after realizing that he might be on the autism spectrum and has survived cancer, are not in line with the value of conformity. Instead of punishing Steven for his non-conformity, the author could have tried to understand or accommodate his differences. The author's realization and subsequent guilt suggest a potential change in his behavior towards Steven in the future.

Long story short my friend is divorced and is sharing the cust...",Other,Nobody,0.8,0.5714285714285714,False,"<step_1>
The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author's friend and his ex are divorced and share custody of their 2-year-old child.
2. The custody arrangement involves the child moving between homes every other day.
3. The author believes this arrangement could be stressful for the child.
4. The parents believe the child will adapt to the arrangement as he grows up.
5. The author is considering expressing his concerns to his friend.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value in question is 'Conformity', which refers to the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms or politics. In this scenario, the parents' decision to have the child move homes every other day does not conform to traditional custody arrangements, which typically involve longer periods at each home. The author's belief that this arrangement could be stressful for the child aligns with societal norms regarding child stability and routine. 
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on these principles, the author's concern for the child's well-being is valid, as it aligns with societal norms regarding child stability. However, the parents' belief that the child will adapt is also valid, as children can be resilient and adaptable. The author's intention to express his concerns to his friend is not an intrusion but a genuine concern for the child's well-being. However, the final decision rests with the parents, as they have the child's best interests at heart.
</step_3>

Step 4: The author's concern for the child's well-being and his intention to express this concern to his friend is not an intrusion but a reflection of his care for the child. However, the parents' unconventional custody arrangement, while not conforming to societal norms, is not inherently harmful and may work for their specific situation.

5. The classmate and her friend continued to post negative comments about the author even after apologizing.
6. The author stopped interacting with the classmate and her friend due to their behavior.

<step_2>
1. Conformity refers to adjusting one's behavior or thinking to coincide with a group standard.
2. The author did not conform to the expectation of privacy by reading the private conversation.
3. The classmate and her friend did not conform to the social norm of respect and kindness by talking negatively about the author and continuing to post negative comments even after apologizing.

<step_3>
The author violated the principle of privacy by reading the private conversation, which is against the value of conformity. However, the classmate and her friend also violated the value of conformity by not adhering to the social norm of respect and kindness. They continued to post negative comments about the author even after apologizing, which shows a lack of sincerity in their apology and a disregard for the author's feelings.

The fundamental truths in this scenario are:
1. The author has a pet peeve about not receiving a goodnight text.
2. The girl he is dating falls asleep without sending a goodnight text most of the time.
3. The girl had expressed that she would try not to fall asleep without sending a goodnight text.
4. The author is disappointed because she hasn't followed through on her promise.
5. The author is unsure whether to view this as a small quirk or a lack of follow through.
</step_1>

<step_2>
The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario would imply that the girl should conform to the author's preference of receiving a goodnight text. However, it's also important to consider that the girl may have her own habits or routines that don't align with the author's preferences.
</step_2>

<step_3>
Based on the principles, it's clear that the girl has not conformed to the author's preference despite expressing that she would try. However, it's also evident that this is not a major issue for the author, but rather a small disappointment. The girl's inability to consistently send a goodnight text could be due to a variety of reasons, such as forgetfulness, exhaustion, or simply not viewing it as important as the author does. 
</step_3>

The logical conclusion is that while the girl has not conformed to the author's preference, it's a minor issue and not necessarily indicative of a lack of follow through on more important matters. The author should communicate his feelings, but also be understanding of the girl's habits.

5. The author is considering asking the friend to be cleaner or to stop inviting them over.
6. The author's roommates have expressed discomfort with the friend's behavior.
</step_1>

The value of 'Conformity' in this scenario refers to the friend's non-compliance with the house rules set by the author and their roommate. The friend's actions show a lack of respect for the author's space and disregard for the norms of cleanliness and respect for others' property. This is a clear violation of the value of conformity.
</step_2>
