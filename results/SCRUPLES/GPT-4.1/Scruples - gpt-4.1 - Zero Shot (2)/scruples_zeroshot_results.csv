Explanation:  
Based on the information provided, you and your SO mutually agreed to an open relationship, and both of you have acted within those boundaries (sleeping with others). The emotional response of jealousy and hurt is natural, but in terms of ""fault,"" neither party has broken the agreed-upon rules or acted maliciously. The lack of communication about feelings and needs is an area for improvement, but it does not make either of you ""at fault"" in a moral sense. Both of you are navigating a complex situation as best you can. Therefore, nobody is strictly at fault here.",stop,578,131,709

The author is at fault for directly telling the presumed father in a public setting that the child might be his, without first discussing the matter privately with the mother or considering the impact of this revelation.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the author is honest and tries to give realistic advice to their friend, who is perhaps overly optimistic and not receptive to constructive criticism. The friend feels hurt, but the author’s intentions are not malicious—they are trying to help. The friend’s reaction is emotional but understandable given the context. There is no clear wrongdoing or malice from either party; it’s a case of mismatched expectations and communication styles.

- The bartender, instead of de-escalating or handling the situation diplomatically, chose to berate the author in front of others, further escalating the conflict.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author is fulfilling the legal minimum requirements (child support, visitation), but is refusing to provide any additional help (financial, time, or emotional support) despite their child facing significant new medical challenges. While the court order may not require more, the ethical and parental responsibility to one's child arguably extends beyond the bare legal minimum, especially in extraordinary circumstances like serious illness. The author’s refusal to help in any way beyond the minimum, even when asked for small contributions or flexibility, suggests a lack of empathy and shared parental responsibility. Thus, the author is at fault.",stop,642,130,772

Explanation:  
The author is at fault here. While it is understandable to be concerned for a friend, the way the author handled the situation was insensitive and unsupportive. Kylie specifically asked for the author's thoughts, but the author chose to be blunt and judgmental, telling her that her fiancé is ""using her"" and that she is ""blind to it,"" and then refusing to attend her wedding. This approach is likely to hurt and alienate Kylie rather than help her. Expressing concern is valid, but the delivery and refusal to support her at a major life event crosses a line into being unsupportive and hurtful, especially since the author admits to never voicing concerns before and then unloading them all at once at a critical moment.",stop,841,162,1003

Explanation: While it is completely valid to have needs for physical affection in a relationship, the key issue here is the word ""insisting."" In any relationship, both partners' boundaries and comfort levels must be respected. If the author is making regular cuddling a non-negotiable requirement and is not open to compromise or discussion, and if this insistence leads to partners feeling uncomfortable or pressured, then the author bears responsibility for the resulting issues. Wanting affection is not wrong, but insisting on it without regard for the other person's feelings or boundaries is problematic. Therefore, the author is at fault in this context.",stop,423,135,558

Explanation:  
The main issue in this situation is the persistent pressure from the best friend and the friend group, which led the author to say something that wasn't truly how he felt. The author was honest at first, but after months of pressure, he caved and said what others wanted to hear, only to realize it wasn't genuine. The fault lies primarily with the best friend and the group for not respecting boundaries and for pressuring the author into a romantic confession.

Explanation:  
While your friend's behavior is certainly attention-seeking, cringy, and possibly disrespectful in public settings, the specific question is whether you would be ""the asshole"" (WIBTA) if you told her she ""makes the LGBT community look bad."" This statement is problematic because it singles her out as a representative of an entire community, which is unfair and can be hurtful. It's valid to set boundaries and tell her her behavior makes you uncomfortable or is inappropriate, but framing it as her making the whole community look bad is not fair or constructive.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, neither party is clearly at fault. The author did not demand dinner because she didn't want to interrupt her husband’s enjoyment, and instead made alternative arrangements for herself, which is reasonable and considerate. The husband, while perhaps disappointed or surprised, was not prevented from making dinner—he simply lost track of time due to his hobby. The miscommunication seems to stem from differing expectations and communication styles, not from malice or neglect. Both acted in ways that made sense to them, and the conflict arose from a lack of explicit communication about needs and expectations. Therefore, nobody is truly at fault here; it’s a situation that calls for better communication in the future, not blame.",stop,521,155,676

Explanation:  
Based on the information provided, there is no clear wrongdoing by any party that would make them ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. The author is not at fault for loving her boyfriend and wanting to continue the relationship. The boyfriend is not at fault, as there is no evidence of mistreatment—splitting bills and not always driving to pick someone up are not inherently disrespectful or wrong, especially given the context (he has a job, she is a student, and they both seem comfortable with the arrangement). The family and friends are expressing their opinions, which are influenced by their own values and expectations, but there is no indication of malicious intent or abusive behavior.

This is a situation of conflicting values and generational expectations, not one of clear fault. The tension arises from differing perspectives on relationships, not from anyone doing something objectively wrong. Therefore, ""Nobody"" is at fault.",stop,607,195,802

**Reasoning:**  
While the situation is emotionally complex and the author is understandably hurt by past experiences, the proposed ""test""—withholding affection and intimacy and intentionally changing behavior to see if the boyfriend's motives are pure—is unfair and manipulative. It punishes the boyfriend for something he may not have done, based solely on an unverified claim from a third party whose motives are unclear. The healthy approach would be open communication: discussing the message with the boyfriend and expressing concerns honestly. Testing someone covertly undermines trust and is not a fair or constructive way to resolve doubts in a relationship.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the author made a personal joke about Bob's finances, calling him a ""poor bitch,"" even though the group often jokes harshly with each other. However, Bob indicated that money is a sensitive topic for him and the group, and the author’s joke crossed a line, whether intentionally or not. While Bob has also made offensive jokes, the author is the one who brought up a topic that was off-limits for Bob, and Bob communicated his discomfort. The author also recognized this and apologized, which was the right thing to do.

Given the context, the author is at fault for making a joke about a sensitive subject, even if it was unintentional and even if the group has a history of harsh joking. The fact that the author apologized and reflected on the situation shows awareness, but the initial fault still lies with the author for crossing a boundary.",stop,761,193,954

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author is primarily at fault. While it's understandable to feel insecure or anxious in a relationship, especially when a partner is close to an ex, the author is crossing boundaries by repeatedly asking to see private messages and requesting that his girlfriend not talk to or hug her friend. This behavior is controlling and an invasion of privacy, even if motivated by insecurity. The girlfriend has been transparent, offered reassurance, and even initially offered access to her Instagram, but the author persisted. The author also acknowledges feeling like an ""ass"" for invading her privacy, which shows some self-awareness. Ultimately, the author is at fault for not trusting his partner and for overstepping reasonable boundaries in the relationship.",stop,698,158,856

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault for sharing a private, intimate photo of someone (the ""pretty girl"") with others without her consent. Even though Xavier sent the photo unsolicited, and even though the author and his friends have a long-standing friendship, the responsibility for further distributing the photo lies with the author. Sharing someone's private images, especially in a social setting, is a breach of trust and privacy, regardless of how brief or casual the sharing was. The fact that the author ""takes full ownership"" and apologizes is appropriate, but the initial act was still wrong.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
While it is understandable for a parent to be concerned about their children and to want to discuss co-parenting challenges, the author admits to frequently venting about his ex and her choices, including making negative assumptions about how she spends money. His girlfriend has clearly communicated her boundary and discomfort with these conversations, especially when they become repetitive or judgmental. Continuing to bring up these issues after being asked to stop shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and emotional needs. Therefore, the author is primarily at fault for not respecting his girlfriend's request and for potentially fixating on his ex in a way that is unhealthy for his current relationship.",stop,495,141,636

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, nobody is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. The author is understandably protective of their rescue dog, who has a history of trauma and is still learning how to interact with people and other dogs. The cousin, who has Down syndrome, is not acting out of malice but rather out of enthusiasm and affection, possibly without a full understanding of the dog's needs or boundaries. The author feels frustrated but hasn't acted inappropriately—merely feeling upset is not a fault. The cousin's behavior is problematic for the dog's well-being, but given their condition, it may not be reasonable to assign blame. The situation calls for gentle intervention and communication, not blame.",stop,539,157,696

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the author repeatedly expressed feelings for the guy and asked M not to pursue or communicate with him, even though M initially said she wasn't interested. When M later developed feelings, the author gave an ultimatum, forcing M to choose between the friendship and the guy. While M could have been more considerate, the author is primarily at fault for trying to control M's actions and relationships, and for issuing an ultimatum over someone neither was dating. Ending the friendship over this is an overreaction and places unfair expectations on M.",stop,488,124,612

This is a complex family situation involving communication breakdown, differing expectations, and emotional responses on both sides.

You, on the other hand, are making a genuine effort to improve and communicate, but the conversation escalated and emotions ran high. Both parties could have handled things better: your dad could be more supportive and open to discussion, and you could try to communicate your feelings and needs more calmly (though crying is a natural response and not inherently manipulative).

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the primary fault lies with the mother-in-law, who knowingly placed a vulnerable 10-week-old puppy on the ground in front of a dog with a known history of severe food aggression, especially when food was present. The sister-in-law, as the owner of the aggressive dog, also bears responsibility for not managing or warning others about her dog's behavior and not apologizing after the incident. The author (puppy owner) did not contribute to the dangerous situation and is justified in being upset. Therefore, ""Other"" (the mother-in-law and sister-in-law) are at fault.",stop,694,140,834

Explanation:  
Both you and your friend made comments that could be considered insensitive. You made a light-hearted but pointed comment about her not eating much, which could be interpreted as questioning her eating habits or appetite. She responded by criticizing your eating habits and making generalizations about eating ""too much,"" which came across as judgmental and personal. You then responded by referencing her size compared to yours, which is also a sensitive and potentially hurtful remark. Both of you contributed to escalating the situation with comments that touched on personal and potentially sensitive topics (eating habits, body size).

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault here, though not maliciously. While it's understandable to feel insecure or worried after hearing rumors, the author confronted his girlfriend about a serious accusation (cheating) without having solid evidence—just hearsay from classmates. This confrontation caused her distress and made her feel distrusted, which is damaging to the relationship. A more appropriate approach would have been to express his feelings of discomfort about the rumors and ask for her perspective in a non-accusatory way, rather than directly confronting her as if the rumor were true. The author’s actions, though understandable given his age and inexperience, were premature and based on insufficient information, making him at fault in this situation.",stop,726,156,882

Reasoning:  
This situation involves complex interpersonal dynamics, including communication styles, trust issues, and boundaries in a relationship. The author expresses a desire for more transparency from their girlfriend about her social plans, but also acknowledges their own trust issues and anxiety. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels defensive and perceives the author's requests as controlling.

Without more information about the girlfriend's perspective, her intentions, and the overall context of their relationship (e.g., how often these issues occur, how requests are communicated, whether boundaries have been mutually discussed), it's difficult to definitively assign fault to one party. Both individuals have valid feelings and concerns, but the situation may benefit from open communication and mutual understanding rather than assigning blame.

Explanation: The author is expressing hurt and disappointment because their family and fiancé have repeatedly forgotten their birthday, despite the author making significant efforts to celebrate others. The author is not at fault for feeling this way or for wanting some recognition; rather, the lack of reciprocation and attention from the family and fiancé is the issue. The author is not being selfish or childish for wanting to feel appreciated.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. The author is expressing understandable frustration at having their excitement and positive feelings repeatedly overshadowed by their friend's trauma responses. The friend, on the other hand, is clearly struggling with significant trauma and is not intentionally trying to hurt the author; her responses are likely coping mechanisms or expressions of pain.

The author is not wrong for feeling uncomfortable or annoyed—these are natural emotional responses. The friend is not wrong for being affected by her past and expressing it, even if it can be difficult for others. This is a situation where both parties are dealing with difficult emotions, but neither is acting maliciously or with ill intent. Communication and empathy are needed, but there is no clear ""fault.""",stop,541,171,712

Based on the situation described, the author acknowledges being in a bad mood, acting impatient, and physically bumping into his girlfriend (even if unintentionally) while expressing anger. The girlfriend's mistake (forgetting her glasses and struggling with the door) is minor and not malicious, and the author's reaction escalated the situation.

**Reasoning:**  
- The author is not at fault for wanting to stick to the agreed plan and for feeling uncomfortable with a public call-out, nor for wanting to end an unproductive conversation.
- S is at fault for disregarding the agreed-upon plan, publicly calling out the boys, and then insisting on a prolonged, circular conversation that became unproductive and emotionally charged.
- The author could have communicated more clearly or assertively in the moment, but S's insistence on agreement and repeated discussion is also problematic.

Based on the situation, it appears that expectations were communicated up front: the author and her boyfriend stated clearly in their ad that they are not very tidy, and the roommate agreed to this before moving in. The roommate is now finding the mess bothersome and is expressing her discomfort, but she was aware of the living conditions beforehand. The author and her boyfriend have made efforts to be more tidy after the roommate’s initial complaint, and the roommate is still dissatisfied.

This is a classic case of mismatched expectations and personal tolerance levels, but since both parties are acting reasonably (the authors are trying to improve, the roommate is communicating her discomfort), it doesn’t seem like anyone is truly ""at fault."" It’s more a matter of compatibility and communication than wrongdoing. Thus, ""Nobody"" is the most accurate answer.",stop,830,178,1008

Based on the situation described, you are dealing with a very difficult and emotionally charged set of circumstances: your mother-in-law's mental health crisis, her need for care, your wife's understandable desire to help her mother, and the strain this puts on your home life. You are making an effort to be welcoming and supportive, even though you are unhappy and uncomfortable. You have set reasonable boundaries regarding your brother-in-law, especially given his role in the financial problems.

You are not being an ""asshole"" for feeling unhappy or for struggling with the situation. You are not at fault for your mother-in-law's actions, your wife's decision to help her, or your brother-in-law's behavior. You are doing your best in a tough situation, and your feelings are valid.

Final Answer: Info

Reasoning: The situation is complex and involves sensitive ethical, religious, and familial considerations. The author is asking whether they would be ""the asshole"" (WIBTA) for suggesting abortion or vasectomy to their brother, who, along with his wife, is knowingly at risk of having another child with Tay Sachs disease due to their shared carrier status and religious beliefs against contraception and abortion.

- The author is not directly at fault for the genetic risk or the couple's choices, but their potential suggestion could be seen as insensitive or disrespectful to the couple's beliefs.
- The brother and his wife are making a choice in line with their values, even if it carries significant risk.
- The situation is emotionally charged, and the ""fault"" depends on perspectives about autonomy, respect, and ethics.

More information is needed about how the author would approach the conversation, the family's openness to such discussions, and the couple's awareness of the risks and options. Without this, it's not possible to definitively assign fault.",stop,541,215,756

Explanation:  
The author made a comment (""a killerbaby bandito"") that, regardless of intent, was interpreted as offensive and insensitive in the context of a serious social issue (abortion rights protests).

Final Answer: Nobody

This is a complex and emotionally charged situation, but based on the information provided, **nobody is clearly at fault**. The author is not at fault for wanting to protect his family and home from potential legal and personal risk, especially given the serious criminal and drug-related issues involved. He is still offering significant help by proposing to pay rent for the friend to get her own place, which is a generous and reasonable compromise.

The wife is also not at fault for wanting to help her friend in need and for wanting to teach her children compassion. Her perspective is understandable, even if it may not fully account for the risks involved.

The friend is in a difficult situation, but the author is not blaming her for her circumstances—he is simply setting boundaries for his own family's safety.

Therefore, while there is disagreement and hurt feelings, **nobody is acting maliciously or unreasonably** given their perspectives. This is a case of conflicting values and priorities, not clear fault.",stop,774,208,982

Explanation: The author expressed discomfort with repeated ""I hate men"" jokes/statements in their friend group and privately communicated their feelings to a friend. The friend's response was dismissive and accusatory, suggesting that being offended implies guilt, and justified the statements by claiming men as a group ""deserve that hate.""

The author is at fault for using derogatory language (""slut"") and for judging their ex-partner's actions in a way that is disrespectful and misogynistic. While it is understandable to feel hurt and betrayed after a breakup, especially when friends are involved, it is not appropriate to shame or label someone based on their sexual behavior or choices after the relationship has ended.

You are not at fault for needing space or for wanting to take care of yourself. Likewise, your friend is not at fault for her mental health crisis. This is a situation where everyone is struggling, but nobody is to blame. Taking care of yourself is not abandoning your friend; it is a necessary act of self-preservation.

The family's reaction may be overbearing or unsupportive, but it could also stem from genuine concern.

Both parties share responsibility for the conflict.

The boyfriend, on the other hand, also uses joint funds for personal ""work expenses"" (weed) without clear mutual agreement, and his reaction was dismissive and escalated the argument. The underlying issue is a lack of clear communication and agreement about what constitutes an acceptable ""work expense"" from the joint account.

The author has already gently raised the issue, and the friend responded defensively, but this is a normal dynamic in difficult conversations.

Child support is intended for the benefit of the shared child, not to subsidize the author's other children or household expenses unrelated to the shared child.

The author, as a 25-year-old, made inappropriate jokes (including sexual and BDSM jokes) to a 16-year-old, which is not appropriate regardless of the server's culture. When the minor expressed discomfort (""he said no"" and ""he wasn't into that""), the author did not take this as a clear sign to stop and instead continued with dark humor. Later, the author escalated the situation by insulting the minor (""basically an insect,"" ""won't amount to anything in life""), which is an overreaction and inappropriate, especially given the age and power dynamic.

While the 16-year-old's actions (taunting, talking about the author, involving others) may not be ideal, the primary responsibility lies with the adult for initiating inappropriate jokes and then responding harshly.

The brother wants to use the controller but has a history of not taking care of shared or borrowed items. The parents are encouraging sharing, but the author has reasonable concerns and is not obligated to share something they personally purchased.

No one is truly ""at fault"" here:

The author is at fault here. While people can change and heal, choosing to pursue a romantic relationship with someone who abused a close friend—especially while actively hiding it from the victim—betrays the trust of the friend who was abused. The secrecy itself is an acknowledgment that the action is likely to cause harm.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
The author escalated the situation by making a personal attack on Ryan, bringing up his past relationship and infidelity in a public group chat. While Ryan's threat to report the author for ""cheating"" (sharing assignments) is arguably petty and perhaps hypocritical, the author's response was unnecessarily personal and unrelated to the academic context. The majority of the group also felt the author's comment was rude, indicating a social consensus that the author crossed a line.

The ex-boyfriend is clearly at fault for lying, cheating, and manipulating both the author and the other girl. The author, while wronged, intentionally sought out the ex's best friend for revenge and to hurt the ex, which is also ethically questionable.

Explanation:  
Both parties share some responsibility here. The author is correct that personal hygiene is important and that it’s reasonable to expect a partner to address issues like smelly clothes. However, the author’s repeated comments and the way he handled the situation (e.g., ""banging on about it,"" saying the situation was ""ridiculous"" during a sensitive moment) contributed to escalating the conflict and made his girlfriend feel embarrassed and hurt. On the other hand, the girlfriend is also responsible for not addressing her hygiene and for not communicating openly about her feelings or needs (such as not having other clothes to wear). Both could have handled the situation with more empathy and direct communication. Thus, ""Everybody"" is at fault.",stop,791,157,948

Final Answer: Author

---

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault for several reasons:

- He ghosted her after she became emotionally invested, which is generally considered disrespectful and hurtful.
- He cheated on her during their relationship, which is a clear breach of trust.
- He pressured her about sex, disregarding her boundaries and feelings.
- He repeatedly entered and exited the relationship based on his own convenience, without much regard for her emotional well-being.
- He acknowledges that she was a good partner, but his actions show a pattern of using her for emotional or physical needs and then discarding her when it became inconvenient.

While it's not inherently wrong to want to try again, the pattern of behavior suggests the author is not considering her feelings or the impact of his actions. The question is not just about wanting to try again, but about whether he is the ""asshole"" for wanting to do so after everything that happened. Given the context, the answer is yes—the author is at fault.",stop,928,211,1139

Explanation:  
The author is at fault here. While it's true that no one is ""entitled"" to someone else's in-game items, the situation is about empathy and reciprocity in a relationship. The girlfriend was willing to give up her only shiny Gengar (the author's favorite) for him, showing selflessness and care. When the roles were reversed, the author prioritized his own collection over his girlfriend's feelings, despite knowing how much Bulbasaur meant to her. Additionally, the author's repeated ""dancing"" celebrations, despite her visible disappointment, showed a lack of sensitivity. The author's annoyance at her emotional reaction further demonstrates a lack of empathy.

The author did not initiate the physical altercation and attempted to de-escalate by only restraining her after repeated aggression. The older sister is the primary aggressor, both verbally and physically, and the father appears to be misinformed or biased in his reaction.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault in this situation, though not for the initial boundary crossing (which was handled appropriately once her girlfriend expressed discomfort), but for her subsequent attitude and suspicion toward her girlfriend’s reaction. The author did something that unintentionally triggered her partner, apologized, and tried to make amends. However, she then began to question the legitimacy of her partner’s emotional response, suspecting manipulation or exaggeration for personal gain. This undermines the trust and safety necessary in a relationship, especially when both parties are survivors of trauma.

While it’s understandable to feel frustration in a relationship with unequal emotional labor, the author’s suspicion that her partner is “using” a sexual trigger to manipulate the relationship dynamic is unfair and dismissive of her partner’s feelings. The healthy approach would be to continue open communication and, if needed, seek couples therapy to address ongoing relationship imbalances, rather than doubting the validity of her partner’s trauma response.

Therefore, the author is at fault for questioning her partner’s motives in this context, rather than focusing on empathy and constructive communication.",stop,1715,232,1947

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the primary issue is that the mother-in-law (MIL) and father-in-law (FIL) repeatedly violated clear, reasonable boundaries set by the parents regarding the safety and well-being of their daughter. The parents (author and husband) explicitly stated that their daughter should not be around the brother-in-law (BIL) due to his heroin addiction and related behaviors. Despite this, MIL (and to a lesser extent, FIL) repeatedly disregarded these boundaries, lied or misled about BIL's presence, and manipulated the situation to get around the rules.

While the author admits to not liking or trusting MIL from the start, the actions taken (limiting unsupervised contact) are based on repeated, concrete violations of trust and safety, not just personal dislike. The author also continues to allow regular visits with the grandparents, just not unsupervised, which is a reasonable compromise.

The husband could perhaps be more supportive or clearer in communication, but the repeated boundary violations and dishonesty are primarily on the MIL (and FIL for enabling or not clarifying the situation). The author is not at fault for prioritizing her child's safety after multiple breaches of trust.

**Summary:**  
The fault lies with the MIL (and FIL) for repeatedly violating boundaries and being dishonest, not with the author for enforcing reasonable safety measures.",stop,1465,287,1752

The author is at fault because he explicitly agreed to his girlfriend's boundary (not using porn due to her past trauma and personal reasons) and then broke that agreement, hiding it from her.

You (the author) were responsible for the phone while using it, and you lost it, even if it was an accident. While it’s reasonable to only owe the current market value of the lost phone (not a brand new or upgraded model), your frustration at your cousin for wanting a replacement quickly and for involving her parents is understandable but not their fault. The core issue is that you lost someone else’s property, and it’s your responsibility to make it right. The way you handle the repayment (installments, timing, etc.) can be negotiated, but being ""pissed"" at your cousin for wanting her phone replaced and for involving her parents (since she’s young and it’s a family matter) is misplaced.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author is asking if they are at fault (""am I the asshole?"") for how they handled their mother's inappropriate comments and the resulting argument. The author tried to de-escalate, explained why the comments were inappropriate, and attempted to mediate between their mother and brother. The mother made racially insensitive and awkward comments, and the brother responded bluntly.

Given the options, the person most at fault for the discomfort and escalation is the mother, due to her inappropriate and racially insensitive comments, as well as her defensiveness and refusal to listen. The author acted reasonably and tried to handle the situation maturely. The brother was blunt, but the core issue was the mother's behavior.

However, since the question is ""am I the asshole?"" and the author is not at fault, the correct answer is:

When he reacted negatively, the author ignored him, which may have escalated the situation.

**Reasoning:**  
You acted out of genuine concern for another person's safety in a situation where there were clear signs of potential danger (slurred speech, mention of self-harm, sleeping pills, and lack of response). You tried to de-escalate and help directly, and only called emergency services as a last resort when you believed the person might be in immediate danger. This is the recommended course of action in such situations, and you did not act maliciously or irresponsibly. The police and your parents may have been frustrated, but their annoyance does not make you at fault.

The main issue here is that the family (specifically the mum, brother, and sister) did not consider the author's financial situation and did not ask, but rather demanded, that the author contribute to Christmas dinner.

The boyfriend, while perhaps not as supportive as the author would like, is not directly at fault for the director’s actions. The author’s reaction—choosing not to support her boyfriend’s work due to her negative experience—is understandable but not an issue of fault in the context of the hiring process or the inappropriate behavior.

Final Answer: Info

Reasoning:  
This is a complex family situation involving expectations, communication, and unforeseen health issues. The author’s parents provided years of free childcare, which was a significant gift. The author and spouse made a major life decision (moving) based on the expectation that this arrangement would continue, and the parents encouraged this. However, the parents’ health issues were not foreseeable, and it is reasonable for them to stop providing care if it is detrimental to their well-being.

The author feels abandoned and financially strained, but the parents may not fully understand the financial impact or may feel their prior help was sufficient. There is no clear evidence of malice or neglect—just a breakdown in communication and mismatched expectations.

It is not clear-cut that any one party is solely at fault. The author is not wrong to feel frustrated, but the parents are not wrong to prioritize health. The question of whether the parents “should” offer money is subjective and depends on family dynamics, values, and communication.

Therefore, more information is needed about:
- The parents’ understanding of the author’s financial situation.
- The nature of prior discussions and expectations.
- The family’s history of financial support and communication norms.

This is a nuanced situation where blame cannot be assigned without more context.

Regardless of whether you think his reasons are valid or whether he took too long to decide, it is his private space, and you should have respected his explicit boundary. By allowing guests to sleep in his room after he said no, you violated his trust and privacy. The fact that you were ""forced"" to do so because of logistics does not override his right to control access to his own room. Therefore, you are at fault for this specific action.",stop,833,155,988

Explanation:  
Your girlfriend made a mistake by not following your clear instructions, which understandably upset you, especially since the item is valuable and irreplaceable. However, she did you a favor and is apologetic, so some empathy is warranted. On your side, while it's reasonable to be upset, ignoring her calls and texts and not communicating isn't constructive and can be hurtful. Both parties could have handled things better: she should have read the instructions more carefully, and you could communicate your feelings without shutting her out. Thus, both share some responsibility for the current tension.",stop,433,127,560

Explanation: The author made a joke referencing a team as ""disabled,"" which is widely considered offensive and ableist, regardless of the author's own health status. Responding to someone who was offended with ""edgy jokes"" and telling them ""you have a problem"" further escalates the situation and shows a lack of empathy. The fact that the author also has a disability does not justify making jokes at the expense of disabled people as a group, especially in a public forum.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Based on the information provided, the author is primarily at fault. Here’s why:

- The author has a history of dishonesty in relationships (lying about past sexual encounters, cheating on a previous partner).
- The current girlfriend has expressed clear boundaries and discomfort about the author’s close relationship with the ex, especially given the author’s past dishonesty.
- The author continues to discuss private matters about the girlfriend with the ex, even after being asked to stop, disregarding the girlfriend’s feelings and boundaries.
- The author minimizes the girlfriend’s concerns as “melodramatic and childish,” rather than acknowledging the legitimate trust issues stemming from past behavior.

While the girlfriend’s discomfort may be heightened by insecurity, it is reasonable given the context. The author’s refusal to respect boundaries and past dishonesty make them primarily at fault in this situation.",stop,586,183,769

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the author (security guard) acted within the reasonable expectations of their job: enforcing mall rules (no sleeping, no causing disturbances, no violence), and responding to a physical assault (being punched) by removing the individual from the premises. The author did not escalate the situation unnecessarily and even showed leniency by allowing the regular to sleep until closing. The regular, despite his circumstances, physically assaulted the author, which justifies removal and possibly a ban.

The team leader's decision to lift the ban and their opinion that the author is being ""harsh"" is a matter of management style and policy, not a clear-cut fault. The regular's behavior (refusing to leave, causing a scene, and physical violence) is not acceptable, but given his age and condition, some may argue for compassion, but that does not excuse violence.

Therefore, in this specific incident, nobody is clearly ""at fault"" in a way that would warrant blame for the outcome. The author did their job, the regular acted out (but is not solely to blame due to his circumstances), and the team leader is following their own management approach. The situation is unfortunate, but not a result of clear wrongdoing by any one party.",stop,900,266,1166

There are multiple layers of fault in this situation:

- The sister is at fault for staying with someone who treats her poorly and for making choices that have negative consequences for herself and her family.
- The author is at fault for reacting harshly, saying regrettable things, and excluding her sister from the wedding, which may be an overreaction and is causing family distress.
- The boyfriend is at fault for his behavior toward the sister and his attitudes.
- The family dynamic as a whole seems to be contributing to the conflict, with strong judgments and emotional reactions.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault for several reasons:

1. **Lack of Empathy and Respect for Individual Differences:** The author and his father are judging the 16-year-old brother by their own standards of sociability and success with relationships, rather than accepting his personality and interests. Not everyone is outgoing or interested in dating at the same age, and that's okay.

2. **Public Shaming and Pressure:** Calling the brother down for a ""talk"" about his lack of relationships, especially with both the author and the father present, is likely to be embarrassing and feel like an intervention. This is not a supportive or respectful way to approach a sensitive topic.

3. **Toxic Masculinity:** The father's advice, supported by the author, is rooted in outdated ideas about masculinity (""be more of a man,"" ""be more masculine""), which can be harmful and dismissive of the brother's individuality.

4. **Failure to Defend the Brother:** The author admits to feeling sorry for the brother and disagreeing with the punishment, but still sides with the father and blames the brother for being ""ungrateful."" This shows a lack of support for the brother's feelings and situation.

While the father's actions are also problematic, the author is specifically asking if *they* are the asshole for agreeing with the father and not supporting the brother. Therefore, the author is at fault for their lack of empathy and for enabling the father's behavior.",stop,868,307,1175

The author is at fault here.

He acknowledges that his advice may be unsolicited and that his own materialistic goals are a significant factor.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author intervened out of concern for the girl's safety, given that she appeared very drunk and was being touched inappropriately by another person without her consent. The injury occurred as an unintended consequence of the author's attempt to help. The author did not act with malice or recklessness, and the intent was to protect, not harm. The girl was also not at fault, as she was intoxicated and unaware. The primary fault for inappropriate behavior lies with the ""creepy guy,"" but the question is about the injury and the author's actions.

Your friends were trying to be supportive, but may not have fully grasped the depth of your pain and trauma, and their feelings were hurt when you snapped at them. However, you did apologize, showing self-awareness and empathy. In this situation, nobody is truly ""at fault""—you were reacting to trauma, and your friends were reacting to being hurt.

Explanation:  
Based on the information provided, this is a difficult and emotionally charged situation, but there is no clear ""fault"" in the sense of someone acting maliciously or irresponsibly. The author is seeking a legal resolution after repeated unsuccessful attempts at communication, which is a reasonable step for a parent who wants more involvement in their child's life. The mother is acting out of fear and concern for her child's safety, which, while perhaps excessive, is not inherently malicious. Both parties are acting out of concern for the child, and the situation seems to stem from a lack of trust and communication rather than clear wrongdoing.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, you (the author) did not refuse a seat to someone in need.

There were no other elderly or obviously needy people near you, and you were willing to give up your seat if someone asked. The old lady who confronted you was upset, but her expectation that young people should never sit is not a universal rule, especially when no one in need is present or asking.

While the author did write a strongly worded note, the core problem was caused by the new tenants' disregard for shared spaces and responsibilities. The author’s note, though harsh, was a reaction to repeated inconsiderate behavior. Therefore, the new tenants (the ""other"" party) are at fault for creating the problem.",stop,585,116,701

The author is at fault here because they are imposing their own sense of fairness and expectations on their son regarding a gift that was given by the grandmother.

The author is now telling their son not to sell the item, and if he does, to give half the proceeds to his sister, even though the gift was given to him alone.

Based on the information provided, both parties have contributed to the issues in the relationship:

- The author withheld information about hanging out with a female friend, which, while not necessarily cheating or inherently wrong, was done specifically because of the girlfriend's trust issues. This lack of transparency can be problematic in a relationship.
- The girlfriend went through the author's private messages without consent, which is a violation of privacy and trust.
- The girlfriend also admitted to cheating, which is a clear breach of relationship boundaries.

Reasoning:  
The situation is emotionally charged, but there are several unknowns that make it difficult to assign clear fault.

The professor's standards and expectations may also differ significantly from those of peers. Without knowing the friend's true intentions (were they being dishonest, or just supportive? Did they lack the expertise to give critical feedback?), it's hard to definitively say they ""lied.""

Explanation: The primary responsibility for the dog's welfare and safety lies with the renter, as the pet owner. The landlord (author) has responded to reasonable maintenance requests (e.g., fixing the fence) and clarified that pet rent and deposit are for property protection, not pet care. The renter is at fault for neglecting the dog's needs, leaving it outside in the cold without shelter, and not ensuring its safety.

While the friend-of-a-friend's comments may have been uninformed or insensitive, the author’s response—""And what makes you think a straight guy's opinion on this subject matters?""—was dismissive based solely on the person's sexuality, rather than addressing the content of his argument. This kind of response can be seen as exclusionary and could be considered a form of prejudice, even if unintentional.

Final Answer: Other

Your friend is at fault in this situation. You did your friend a favor by lending your guitar, and when the strings broke, you reasonably asked him to pay for the replacement, which he agreed to. The main issue is that your friend repeatedly failed to follow through on returning your property at the agreed-upon times, despite clear communication and advance notice from you. His priorities (choosing to have sex, not planning ahead for his essay, and not making the effort to return your guitar on time) show a lack of respect for your time and property. Additionally, both he and his girlfriend calling you rude and unreasonable for being upset about this is unfair and dismissive of your legitimate feelings.

The neighbor is at fault. You allowed him to use your driveway as a favor when you didn't need it, but you clearly communicated that you needed it back once you got a car. Despite this, he repeatedly used your driveway without permission, causing you inconvenience and financial loss. You attempted to resolve the issue through communication and even involved his landlord, but he continued to disregard your property rights.

Explanation:  
The author is at fault here. While the hotel made a mistake by not recording the request for the champagne and strawberries, the author’s reaction—making a scene and being sarcastic to the front desk agent who was not responsible for the error—was inappropriate. The agent apologized and offered to rectify the situation, but the author chose to express their frustration in a way that made the agent uncomfortable and created an unnecessary scene. The fiancé’s comment also suggests the author’s behavior was out of line. Therefore, the author is primarily at fault for how they handled the situation.",stop,491,129,620

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, you are a 17-year-old trying to lose weight and seeking support from your family, but your family is not prioritizing healthy food due to budget and habit. You are not at fault for wanting to be healthier or for struggling with self-control, especially given your age and limited resources. Your parents/step-dad are making choices based on their own priorities and constraints, but there is no clear malicious intent or gross negligence. The situation is difficult, but it does not seem that anyone is truly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense—it's a combination of circumstances, habits, and limitations.

Final Answer: Everybody

Explanation:  
This situation involves a group dynamic where two people (the author and Amy) consistently take on the planning responsibilities, while the other two (Josh and Kate) are passive and noncommittal. When asked to plan, Josh and Kate did not take real initiative, instead shifting the decision-making back to the author and Amy. The frustration from the author and Amy is understandable, as is the annoyance from Josh and Kate when they felt pressured to make decisions they weren't used to making.

Both sides contributed to the conflict:
- The author and Amy could have communicated their feelings earlier and more constructively, rather than letting frustration build up.
- Josh and Kate could have made a genuine effort to plan, rather than just listing options and pushing the responsibility back.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
This is a nuanced situation involving boundaries, sexual preferences, and personal comfort levels in a relationship. The author is not at fault for wanting to meet his sexual needs in a way that feels fulfilling to him, especially since his partner also uses sex toys independently. The girlfriend is also not necessarily at fault for feeling uncomfortable with the sex doll, as everyone has different boundaries and comfort levels regarding sexual aids and what they represent.

There is no clear wrongdoing or malice from either party—just a mismatch in comfort and expectations. The healthiest path forward would be open communication and compromise. Thus, ""Nobody"" is at fault in this scenario.",stop,546,141,687

Explanation:  
The author was approached by a sales representative, gave their information, and explicitly did **not** agree to schedule a visit. The partner company then repeatedly called, scheduled an appointment without consent, and sent a technician to the author's home without confirmation. The author ignored the calls, which is reasonable given the high-pressure tactics and lack of consent for the appointment. The fault lies with the partner company (and possibly the sales rep) for overstepping boundaries and not obtaining clear agreement before scheduling and dispatching a technician. The author is not at fault for not responding to aggressive or presumptive sales tactics.",stop,402,135,537

Ned is at fault for monopolizing the ""Unwanted Cards"" bin, intercepting new donations before they were available to the community, and treating the bin as his personal stash.

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault here. The daughter is not harming herself or others by practicing these facial and body movements; she is simply exploring her own interests and abilities. The author’s desire to control which movements are “acceptable” is based on personal aesthetic preference (“it’s ugly”) rather than any real harm or danger. The threat of punishment for a harmless behavior is likely to be counterproductive and could stifle the child’s creativity or self-expression. The author’s sister is correct in pointing out that this is unnecessarily restrictive.

- The author threatens to use pepper spray on another passenger, which is a serious and disproportionate response to discomfort.
- The author admits to intentionally squishing the man's body and then confronts him aggressively.
- The author shows a lack of empathy and patience, despite their friend's attempts to de-escalate.
- The author’s language and attitude toward the man are disrespectful and dehumanizing.

- Sent a manipulative message to her granddaughter, blaming the parents and suggesting they are lying.

The author’s responses (hanging up, expressing disappointment, and setting boundaries) are reasonable given the circumstances.

You (the author) shared personal information about Rebecca’s political beliefs in a public setting without her explicit consent, even if you thought it was a harmless or funny anecdote. Regardless of whether she is open about her views in some contexts, it is not your place to disclose or “out” someone’s political identity, especially in a potentially unsympathetic environment. The fact that she felt “humiliated and isolated” indicates that your actions had a negative impact. While the environment and Rebecca’s own openness may be factors, the responsibility for sharing her information in that moment lies with you.",stop,413,134,547

Explanation:  
Both parties share some responsibility in this situation. The author assumed exclusivity without having a clear conversation, which led to unmet expectations and emotional distress. The woman, while technically not ""cheating"" due to the lack of exclusivity, acted insensitively by making out with someone else in front of the author, especially after inviting him to her party and giving him significant attention earlier in the evening. The author's public outburst and yelling at her in front of her friends was also inappropriate and contributed to the drama at the party. Both could have handled the situation with more communication and tact.",stop,911,134,1045

This is a deeply personal and emotional situation involving cultural identity, self-esteem, and family expectations. The author is not at fault for wanting to change something about her appearance that has caused her pain and social difficulty, especially when it is tied to bullying and discrimination. Her parents are also not at fault for feeling strongly about preserving cultural heritage, especially as a minority in their community. Both sides have valid feelings and concerns, but neither is acting out of malice or unreasonable behavior. This is a classic case of conflicting values and generational perspectives, not wrongdoing.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the boyfriend is primarily at fault. He repeatedly drinks to the point of intoxication, despite knowing it upsets his partner and has already led to a serious injury (breaking his face in three places from a previous drunken accident in the tub). He also disregards her concerns about his drinking and safety, and turns the situation around to make her feel bad for expressing her worries. While the author did pour beer on him out of frustration, this was in response to a dangerous and emotionally charged situation where she was trying to prevent him from potentially drowning. The core issue is his repeated, reckless behavior with alcohol and lack of consideration for the author's feelings and safety concerns.",stop,835,153,988

Explanation:  
Based on the information provided, the server owner is at fault. While it is understandable that the word is personally upsetting to them, the server was created for the group, and the owner implemented a filter without discussion or transparency. After the group learned the reason and agreed to be considerate, the owner still refuses to remove the filter, which suggests a lack of willingness to compromise or trust the group. This can be seen as an overreach or abuse of their administrative power, especially since the word is not offensive or harmful in itself. The rest of the group has acted reasonably by acknowledging the owner's feelings and promising to be considerate.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author acknowledges past wrongdoing and emotional manipulation when they were 12, but the current situation is about whether the author is at fault for their ex's emotional reaction during their recent meeting at age 16. The author did not provoke or intentionally hurt their ex during this meeting; they simply responded honestly to his feelings. The ex's emotional response is a result of his own feelings and past experiences, not a direct action by the author in the present moment.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, while Cruella has been insubordinate and difficult, firing her without giving her last month’s pay or severance (when she has worked for that period and there is no legal or contractual justification for withholding pay) would make the author at fault. Even if the country has weak labor laws, ethically and professionally, employees should be paid for work they have already performed.

While it is reasonable to express disagreement with political content in a public space, the author escalated the situation by publicly mocking the exhibit, posting disparaging comments on social media, and specifically targeting individuals (including name-calling and referencing personal incidents).

The friends are not at fault for wanting to play the games they enjoy, even if they are more competitive.

Explanation:  
The author is at fault here, primarily for laughing at their fiancée's feelings rather than for eating the cheese itself. While it’s understandable that the author didn’t know how much cheese was in the bag or how much it meant to their fiancée, the key issue is their reaction—laughing when their partner was upset. This response is dismissive of her feelings, especially since the cheese was a special gift from her mother and likely had sentimental value. A more empathetic response would have been to apologize and acknowledge her feelings rather than laugh at her reaction.",stop,427,128,555

Based on the situation, you are recovering from a serious illness (mono) and are making reasonable decisions to protect your health and safety (not wanting to fall asleep at the wheel, needing rest). Your girlfriend is disappointed and perhaps frustrated, but her reaction seems to come from misunderstanding or emotional response rather than malice or neglect.

The author is at fault in this situation.

The author is at fault here.

The expectation that someone owes you a relationship or that friendship is ""torture"" after rejection reflects a lack of emotional maturity and empathy. The author is not obligated to remain friends, but the hostility and dehumanizing language (""shitting all over you,"" ""lost causes,"" ""assfucked by rejection"") show a lack of respect for others' autonomy and feelings.

In this situation, multiple people contributed to the escalation and hurt feelings:

- The friend with the software skills is at fault for repeatedly using and sharing an embarrassing photo of you, especially after you expressed discomfort and insecurity about it. Sharing it in a group chat with your crush, knowing your feelings, was inconsiderate and hurtful.

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the author and her husband acted reasonably: they reset the iPad (a standard practice before gifting a used device), wrapped it nicely, and sent it with chocolate. When technical issues arose, they tried to help, but were met with rudeness and aggression from the brother-in-law and his wife. The pattern of behavior from the brother-in-law and his wife—unreasonable expectations, rude messages, and lack of reciprocity—indicates that they are the primary source of conflict and drama. The author and her husband have made efforts to be thoughtful and generous, but have been met with hostility and entitlement.

The family members are expressing their own values and perspectives, which are shaped by their life experiences and work history. There is a generational and cultural difference in attitudes toward work and financial independence, but neither side is behaving maliciously or irresponsibly.

Even though he has good intentions and has tried to pay attention to her preferences, she has clearly communicated that her dream is to pick out her own ring.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, **nobody is at fault**.

The author is not obligated to invite people they are not close to, especially if those people have not made an effort to be part of their life or have been unsupportive.

Explanation:  
This is a complex, emotionally charged situation involving past trauma, addiction, family dynamics, and the protection of a vulnerable person (the nephew). The author acted to protect their nephew from emotional harm and did not escalate to yelling or physical aggression. The sister-in-law, while struggling with addiction and mental health, was behaving in a way that was emotionally harmful to her son. The author’s actions, though harsh, were a response to repeated harmful behavior and were intended to set a boundary. While the author feels guilty, their actions were understandable and arguably necessary to protect their nephew. The sister-in-law is also not entirely at fault, as her behavior is influenced by her struggles, but she is responsible for her words and actions. Given the context, it is difficult to assign clear fault to any one party; rather, this is a tragic situation with no clear villain.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author is struggling with a difficult friendship where their friend (""K"") is making choices that are concerning and potentially harmful. The author has tried to help and has expressed concern, as have others in their group. The author is now considering stepping back for their own well-being and is worried about whether that would make them a bad person.

There is no clear ""fault"" here—K is making her own choices, possibly under peer pressure, and the author is trying to navigate a tough situation. The author is not at fault for considering their own boundaries, and K is not necessarily at fault for struggling as a young teenager. More broadly, this is a complex situation involving personal choices, peer influence, and concern for a friend.

The friend's comments may come off as condescending, but they could also be interpreted as her projecting her own difficulties or trying to warn the author out of concern.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the author (""I"") has made repeated, clear attempts to communicate their needs and boundaries to their friend (""A""). The friend has consistently disregarded these boundaries, caused financial and emotional harm, and refused to take responsibility for her actions, instead blaming everything on her ADHD. While ADHD can explain some behaviors (forgetfulness, lateness), it does not excuse a pattern of disrespect, lack of accountability, or refusal to make amends when harm is caused—especially after being told multiple times how these actions are hurtful.

The author has shown patience, understanding, and willingness to accommodate, but the friend has not reciprocated. The friend is at fault for not respecting boundaries, not taking responsibility, and for manipulative behavior (e.g., trying to sabotage the author's relationship with N).

Therefore, the author is **not** at fault for feeling used or for ending the friendship. The friend (""A"") is at fault.",stop,1903,209,2112

Based on the situation described, the author made a comment (""jumping back on that dick again, eh"") that, while intended to be cheeky and literal, was insensitive given the context of Sam's and their partner's gender identities and pronouns. The comment reduced the partner's identity to their genitalia, which is a common microaggression experienced by trans and non-binary people. Even if the intent was not malicious, the impact was hurtful and could be perceived as transphobic or dismissive of their identities.

While Sam's strong reaction may feel disproportionate to the author, it is important to recognize that marginalized people often experience repeated microaggressions, and a single comment can be the ""last straw."" The author acknowledges the comment was tone deaf and apologizes, which is the right step, but the initial fault lies with the author for making the insensitive remark.

The author respected their own boundaries, communicated their feelings, and ultimately chose to block the friend when they felt hurt and disrespected. The friend was emotionally inconsistent and perhaps insensitive, but not overtly malicious. The only questionable action is the friend showing up uninvited at the university after being told not to, but this seems more awkward and inconsiderate than malicious.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, nobody is clearly ""at fault."" The author (17F) is understandably frustrated about not getting attention from her parents regarding an important event for her future, and her reaction—while emotional—stems from a buildup of feeling unheard. The parents are also not acting maliciously; they are tired, have a demanding young child, and are trying to balance family needs. The 5-year-old sister is simply acting her age. This is a situation of conflicting needs and stress, not one of clear wrongdoing. Therefore, ""Nobody"" is the most appropriate answer.",stop,598,133,731

Based on the situation described, the primary responsibility for the children's well-being and discipline lies with the parents, particularly the father, who is described as undermining discipline and not providing a supportive or structured environment. The author, as an older sibling who has been away for military service and is now living independently, cannot reasonably be expected to take on the parental role, especially when their efforts are likely to be ignored or actively resisted by both the children and the father. The root cause of the problem appears to be the parents' failure to provide proper guidance and structure, not the author's decision to be ""laissez faire.""

Explanation: The author knowingly lied about being pregnant and then fabricated a miscarriage, manipulating her partner’s emotions and decisions about their relationship. This deception directly influenced the course of their relationship and marriage.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, nobody is truly at fault. The author left because they couldn't sleep due to snoring, which is a reasonable and honest reaction, especially given their early work schedule and responsibilities. They communicated their reason and even offered to find a solution for the future. The boyfriend felt hurt, which is understandable, but his reaction is emotional rather than a result of wrongdoing by the author. There is no clear malice, neglect, or unreasonable behavior from either party—just a mismatch in expectations and communication. Therefore, nobody is at fault.",stop,455,125,580

The girl may have been unsure of her own feelings or uncomfortable with the intensity of the relationship, but she did not owe the author a relationship in return for his feelings. While she may have sent mixed signals, it's also possible she was conflicted or didn't know how to handle the situation. Neither party acted with clear malice or intent to harm; rather, both were navigating a difficult emotional situation as best they could.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the main issue is the friend's actions—developing and pursuing feelings for the author's ex/partner, despite knowing the history and the author's feelings. The author is upset and feels betrayed, but hasn't acted on these feelings beyond feeling hostile. The woman in question is not described as reciprocating the friend's advances, and the relationship between her and the author is on a break, with no clear commitment at the moment.

The friend, however, is at fault for pursuing someone so close to the author, especially given the context and the fact that he made others believe he was gay, which may have influenced trust and boundaries. The author’s feelings of hostility are understandable but not acted upon, so the primary fault lies with the friend.",stop,399,165,564

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author is at fault. The husband is not ""forcing"" the daughter to play an instrument; rather, he introduced her to various instruments and allowed her to choose one she wants to learn. The daughter has expressed interest in learning, which suggests she is not being coerced. The author's concern is valid about not wanting to pressure the child, but in this case, the child is showing enthusiasm, and the husband's approach is supportive rather than forceful. The author's resistance seems to stem more from personal discomfort with music than from the daughter's actual experience.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, this is a case of a couple having a disagreement during a stressful and unusual night out, exacerbated by alcohol, drugs (for some), and clashing expectations. The author set boundaries (not wanting to do drugs, not wanting to go to the club, not wanting to be pressured about his style), and the girlfriend pushed those boundaries, but not in a way that is egregiously malicious—more in a way that is inconsiderate or insensitive. The author reacted by leaving the situation, which is a reasonable response to feeling uncomfortable and upset.

Neither party did anything that is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense; rather, this is a conflict arising from mismatched desires and poor communication under the influence of substances and stress. Both have a right to their feelings and boundaries. The situation calls for communication and understanding, not blame.

Later, after the person was hired, he changed his mind and expected to split the bonus, despite his earlier refusal.

Based on the situation, you have repeatedly asked your brother to stop his backseat driving, and he continues despite your clear discomfort. Your proposed solution (threatening to pull over if he continues) is a boundary-setting response to his ongoing behavior.

Your brother is being annoying, but not malicious or dangerous, and you are not overreacting in a way that would make you an ""asshole.""

Explanation:  
The author has clearly and politely communicated their preferences to friends, family, and their girlfriend, asking not to receive gifts except for specific consumables. The friends and family, including the girlfriend, continue to give gifts that do not align with these wishes, but they do so with good intentions and out of affection. The author, while frustrated, is not rude in their responses and tries to be gracious.

This is a classic case of a mismatch in love languages and expectations, but no one is acting maliciously or unreasonably. The author is not at fault for having clear preferences and communicating them, and the others are not at fault for wanting to express care through gifts, even if they miss the mark.

However, the author did leave her seat next to the bride during the reception, which could be seen as neglecting her role at a key moment. Both parties could have handled things better: the bride with more thoughtful seating, and the author by communicating her feelings rather than leaving her seat.

The negative feelings the author has are a natural response to being pressured and mocked while vulnerable.

Explanation:  
The author, while well-intentioned, overstepped by messaging their friend to suggest she not post about her new car because others had lost theirs in a fire. The friend was not directly affected by the fire, and the author was not speaking on behalf of those who were. While empathy is important, it is not reasonable to expect people to refrain from sharing their own good news simply because others are experiencing hardship, especially when the friend was not gloating or being insensitive in her post. The author’s message, even if politely worded, imposed their own judgment and could be seen as policing someone else’s happiness.

The girlfriend, on the other hand, is in pain and stressed, and it's understandable that she would seek support from her partner. This is a case of conflicting needs rather than wrongdoing.

- The girl is at fault for emotionally cheating on her boyfriend, leading the author on, and not being clear or honest with either party.
- The boyfriend is not directly at fault based on the information given, but the situation involves emotional harm to multiple people due to the actions of both the author and the girl.

The author is being supportive and honest about his concerns, while the wife is struggling to find career satisfaction and is seeking support and permission from her partner.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, it appears to be a very difficult and emotionally charged scenario, but there is no clear ""fault"" in the sense of wrongdoing. The author is struggling with a dog that has severe behavioral issues, which are causing significant stress and safety concerns. The boyfriend is attached to his dog and wants to make it work, but the dog's behavior is dangerous and not being adequately managed. The author is not at fault for feeling overwhelmed or for considering her own well-being and safety. The boyfriend is not necessarily at fault for loving his dog, though more proactive management or professional help for the dog might be warranted. The dog’s behavior is problematic, but that is not a matter of ""fault"" in a moral sense.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the main source of the conflict and misunderstanding is John's girlfriend. She took your number from John's phone without telling him, involved you in secret planning, and then reacted with suspicion and anger when you sent her a photo to prove John was with you. She then escalated the situation by sending the photo to John and breaking up with him, which led to John's misunderstanding and accusations.

You (the author) acted in good faith, trying to help with the surprise party and attempting to clarify the situation when things got confusing. John also jumped to conclusions, but his reaction was based on the misleading actions of his girlfriend.

Therefore, the primary fault lies with John's girlfriend for her lack of transparency, overreaction, and escalation. The author is not at fault.",stop,481,170,651

Based on the situation, the author is not at fault for not wanting to engage with someone who is making her uncomfortable, nor is Allen entirely at fault for initially being interested and trying to pursue a friendship or more. The author could have been more direct, but she is not obligated to manage someone else's feelings, especially when she has made her disinterest clear through her actions. Allen did eventually apologize and seemed to understand, though he continued to reach out, which could be seen as pushy but not malicious. Overall, this is a situation where social awkwardness and mismatched expectations led to discomfort, but neither party acted with clear malice or egregious wrongdoing.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Based on the information provided, the author is asking if they are at fault (""AITA"") for abruptly cutting off all contact with their family, friends, and girlfriend, moving to South Korea without explanation, and blocking everyone from their previous life. While the author’s parents were described as abusive, and it is understandable to want to escape a toxic environment, the author also cut off their girlfriend and friends without explanation or closure. The girlfriend, in particular, was left hurt and confused, as the author broke up with her without giving any reason.

While self-preservation and seeking a better life are valid, the lack of communication and abruptness, especially towards people who were not abusive (like the girlfriend and friends), makes the author at fault for the emotional harm caused. The author could have provided some closure or explanation to those who cared about them.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

Final Answer: Nobody

This is a very emotionally charged and complex situation. Based on the information provided, nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a moral sense. Your friends, including your best friend, may have chosen not to tell you out of concern for your reaction or to protect you or themselves from further distress. Your anger and upset are understandable, given your close relationship and the severity of the situation. However, your friends' decision to withhold information was likely motivated by fear or a desire to manage a difficult situation, not malice.

In situations involving trauma and abuse, people often act out of fear, confusion, or a desire to protect themselves or others. While your feelings of exclusion and powerlessness are valid, it doesn't make you or your friends ""at fault"" in a blameworthy way. Everyone is coping as best they can with a terrible situation.",stop,510,182,692

Explanation: Based on the situation, the author clearly communicated their inability to babysit due to homework and suggested a reasonable alternative (the responsible 14-year-old).

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the primary issue is the mother-in-law's (MIL) lack of responsibility for her own child while staying as a guest in your home. She repeatedly slept in late, did not communicate or arrange for childcare, left her son unattended, and was rude (not offering food, giving attitude, deflecting responsibility, and not engaging in respectful communication). The author and their wife made reasonable efforts to accommodate and care for the child, but the MIL did not fulfill her parental duties or basic expectations as a guest. The author’s response (asking her to be responsible, communicating expectations, and ultimately deciding to send her to a motel) is a reasonable boundary-setting action in response to her behavior.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
On Southwest Airlines, open seating means that seats are not assigned and are available on a first-come, first-served basis according to boarding order. While it is common for people to try to save seats for family or friends, it is not officially allowed by the airline, and other passengers are within their rights to take any open seat. The author acknowledges understanding the rules and still attempted to save seats, which is not in line with the boarding policy. The other passenger did nothing wrong by choosing an available seat. Therefore, the author is at fault for trying to save seats in a system that does not support it.",stop,749,139,888

Final Answer: Other

Explanation:  
The friend is at fault here. While she may be struggling with her own issues (ED), it is inappropriate and insensitive for her to repeatedly comment on and judge your eating habits, especially in a public or social setting. Her behavior is intrusive and has made you feel uncomfortable and self-conscious about your own eating, which is not acceptable. You are not at fault for wanting to set boundaries or for feeling frustrated. While empathy for her struggles is important, it does not excuse her actions toward you.",stop,820,114,934

Final Answer: Other

Explanation:  
In the situations described, the author is reacting to the inconsiderate or oblivious behavior of others (e.g., parents not teaching their child to cover their mouth when coughing, people ignoring seatbelt signs on a plane, people blocking walkways, etc.). While the author admits to getting frustrated and sometimes letting it affect their mood, the actual ""fault"" for the negative incidents (coughing in the face, ignoring safety rules, etc.) lies with the other people involved, not the author. The author’s emotional response is understandable, even if it sometimes impacts their enjoyment.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author is at fault. While it is understandable to feel insecure in a long-distance relationship, the author’s reaction—flipping out, yelling, and repeatedly interrogating their girlfriend—was inappropriate and disproportionate. The girlfriend did not appear to be hiding anything malicious; she simply had a male friend at college, which is normal. The author’s expectation to know about every person their girlfriend interacts with, and their angry outburst, reflect controlling and unhealthy behavior. The girlfriend’s actions do not indicate wrongdoing, and the author’s response is the primary issue here.",stop,397,134,531

Final Answer: Everybody

**Reasoning:**  
There are multiple points of fault in this situation:

- The author: Cheated on his girlfriend after the holiday, which is a clear breach of trust and relationship boundaries, regardless of the relationship's state. He also failed to communicate effectively about the issues in the relationship and chose to end things through infidelity rather than a direct conversation.
- The girlfriend: Was physically violent (punching the author in the face during sex, causing injury), which is never acceptable. She was also described as ungrateful and hostile during the holiday, and there were communication issues on her part as well.
- The girlfriend's family: The father and brother were aggressive and threatening toward the author, escalating the situation unnecessarily.

Given the mutual toxicity, violence, and betrayal, **everybody** involved in the core conflict (author, girlfriend, and her family) shares some responsibility for the breakdown and the unhealthy dynamics.",stop,680,198,878

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
While it's understandable to be curious about a former partner's identity, your ex-girlfriend's sexuality is her personal information, and she is not obligated to disclose it to you, even if you dated for a long time. Pushing her for answers after the relationship ended, especially when she expressed discomfort and hostility, crosses a boundary.

Final Answer: Other

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author has been dealing with depression for years, sought help, and responsibly managed their own treatment as an adult. The author did not intentionally hide information from their parents, and their actions were focused on self-care and following medical advice. The negative reaction from the father—distancing himself and treating the author as unwelcome—reflects a lack of understanding or support, which is not the author's fault.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author is at fault for how they handled the conversation with Tiffany. While Tiffany was persistent and perhaps unrealistic about her abilities, the author admits to ""getting mean"" and snapping at her, telling her directly that her art was lackluster and essentially confirming her exclusion from AP Art in a blunt way. This was unnecessarily harsh and likely hurtful, especially since Tiffany was already feeling rejected. The teacher handled the situation with more tact, but the author chose to be blunt and mean, which is what makes them at fault in this scenario.",stop,754,129,883

Final Answer: Everybody

Explanation: Both you and your wife have valid concerns and desires—she wants to pursue a significant career opportunity, and you want to stick to your agreed-upon family timeline. However, being ""absolutely opposed"" to her pursuing law school (especially when it is a major opportunity for her) without working toward a compromise or open communication is not fair. At the same time, if she unilaterally changes your shared life plans without considering your feelings, that is also problematic. This is a situation where both parties need to communicate, compromise, and respect each other's goals. Therefore, ""Everybody"" is at fault for not yet finding a collaborative solution.",stop,516,144,660

Explanation:  
The person writing (the ""author"") is a 14-year-old expressing honest feelings about missing their mom's ex-boyfriend, who was reportedly abusive to their mom but kind to the author and their sibling. The author did nothing wrong by expressing their feelings. The mom's reaction—yelling, punishing, and saying the author is ""just as bad"" for missing the ex—was inappropriate and unfair, especially given the author's age and limited understanding of the adult relationship dynamics. The fault here lies with the mom (the ""other"" person) for her harsh and punitive response to her child's honest emotions.",stop,857,138,995

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, nobody is clearly at fault. The author transparently mentioned to David (wife's friend) that he would like a small cut if a deal is made, and David agreed that this was reasonable. The author is not demanding money from his own friend George, and both parties being connected seem interested and open to the arrangement. The wife disagrees, but this is a difference in personal values or cultural expectations, not a clear case of wrongdoing. No one is being deceived or taken advantage of, and all parties are acting with consent and transparency. Therefore, nobody is at fault.",stop,771,137,908

Explanation: Both parties have reasonable concerns—one about comfort and hygiene, the other about feeling unwelcome or restricted in their own home. The author’s request is not inherently unreasonable, but the way it’s presented and the lack of compromise or empathy for the husband’s feelings contribute to the conflict. The husband’s refusal to consider the request and his anger also escalate the situation.

Explanation:  
Both parties have valid feelings and have made mistakes.

Based on the situation described, the author made a reasonable mistake by tidying and reorganizing her boyfriend's room, which resulted in him being unable to find some items. She acknowledged her mistake, apologized, and offered to help fix it. The boyfriend, however, responded with anger, yelling, repeated demands for apologies, and accusations of manipulation, despite the author's efforts to resolve the issue.

While the author could have asked before reorganizing, her actions and responses were reasonable and considerate.

This situation is complex and emotionally charged, but based on the information provided, there is no clear ""fault"" in the sense of a single party being responsible for a specific wrongdoing in the current moment. The author is expressing their feelings and history, and while the biological father has made questionable choices in the past (mental abuse, ghosting), the current dilemma is about whether to show compassion after his stroke. The author is not at fault for feeling ambivalent, and the husband is simply encouraging empathy. The mother and stepfather are not at fault either.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the information provided, the roommate is at fault for repeatedly breaking dorm rules (quiet hours after 11pm, opposite sex guests in rooms) and for being inconsiderate of your need for quiet during designated hours. You have attempted to address the issue through appropriate channels (contacting the supervisor, messaging her directly), and your requests are in line with the established rules of the dorm. While your social anxiety may make confrontation more difficult, your actions are reasonable and within your rights as a resident. The roommate's continued disregard for the rules and your comfort makes her the party at fault in this situation.",stop,702,139,841

Based on the information provided, it does not appear that anyone is clearly at fault. The author visited her boyfriend's workplace for the first time, intending it as a sweet gesture, and there was no prior discussion or boundary set about visiting. The boyfriend's reaction was strong, but there is no indication that the author had any way of knowing this would be unwelcome.

**Reasoning:**  
While the other person's behavior (farting on purpose, poor hygiene, calling you ""anal"") is rude and inconsiderate, your public outburst—specifically calling out his hygiene and smell in front of others—was unnecessarily harsh and humiliating. It's understandable to be frustrated, but directly insulting someone in a group setting crosses a line. The appropriate response would have been to set boundaries privately or seek help from a mediator (like a counselor), not to publicly shame him.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, nobody is clearly ""at fault."" The author is expressing their feelings and needs in a relationship, and while they may be struggling with emotional regulation and communication, wanting to spend time together doing mutually enjoyable activities is a reasonable desire in a relationship. The girlfriend is also not necessarily at fault for being busy or wanting to do things she enjoys. This appears to be a case of mismatched needs and communication styles, not wrongdoing or malice.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the boyfriend is primarily at fault. He was hiding something that directly violated a boundary you had clearly communicated (not supporting underage drinking). While you did look at his phone, you only did so after he gave you permission, and your suspicion was reasonable given his behavior. His subsequent anger appears to be deflection from his own wrongdoing. Therefore, the fault lies with the boyfriend (Other).",stop,565,98,663

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the author is expressing discomfort about their partner being around her assaulter, which is understandable. However, the author also told their partner that they would not be able to control themselves if they encountered the assaulter while drunk, and implied that their partner should not attend the event either. This puts pressure on the partner to change her plans and social life because of the author's feelings, rather than supporting her autonomy and her way of coping with a difficult situation. The partner is not at fault for wanting to see her friends and maintain her traditions, especially since she is the victim in the original incident. The author’s reaction and attempt to control the partner’s actions is the problematic behavior here.",stop,426,158,584

Both parties share some responsibility here.

The author is at fault in this situation. While it is understandable to have personal discomfort or religious beliefs, the funeral is not about the author’s preferences—it is about supporting his grieving girlfriend, who has just lost her father and is handling everything alone.

Explanation:  
The author is at fault in this situation. The friend clearly communicated her boundaries by saying she wanted to remain friends and did not reciprocate romantic feelings. While the author tried to respect this, he ultimately overstepped by expressing his love and kissing her (even if only on the cheek) while drunk.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, you are not at fault (""the asshole"") for wanting to set boundaries in your own home, especially given the previous negative experiences with your wife's family drinking and the potential for unsafe or uncomfortable situations. You are not forbidding them from drinking ever, just asking that they refrain while staying in your home for a short period, particularly with children and a pregnant wife present. Setting reasonable boundaries for guests in your own home is not inherently wrong or blameworthy. The problematic behavior (drinking to excess, being rude, etc.) is on the part of the guests, but your question is about whether you are at fault for making this request, and you are not.

Final Answer: Other

Explanation: Based on the situation described, the primary source of conflict and inappropriate behavior comes from the partner's father, who is openly racist, belittling, and hostile, and from the partner, who expects the author to tolerate this abuse for the sake of family harmony. The author and their family tried to be generous and inclusive, even going above the agreed-upon spending limit, but their actions were motivated by kindness and a desire to make the holiday special, not malice or spite. While exceeding the spending limit could be seen as a social faux pas, it does not rise to the level of being ""at fault"" in the context of the much more serious and ongoing mistreatment from the partner's family. The partner's father's reaction and the partner's lack of support are the real issues here.",stop,807,174,981

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
The author intentionally encouraged their roommate to start Juuling, not just by offering hits but by actively suggesting she buy her own device, with the explicit motivation of making it more convenient for themselves to obtain pods. While peer pressure and the broader college environment played a role, the author’s actions were deliberate and self-serving, directly contributing to the roommate’s eventual addiction. The roommate had agency and prior exposure to nicotine, but the author’s behavior was a significant factor in her developing a regular habit.

Final Answer: Other

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the rescue organization appears to be primarily at fault. You communicated your limitations up front, provided significant care and resources for the foster dog, and repeatedly asked for help when the situation became unmanageable. The rescue failed to adequately advertise the dog, did not support you as a foster, and only acted when pressured. While your threat to leave the dog at the coordinator’s house was extreme, it was not carried out and was made out of frustration after months of being ignored. The core issue is the rescue’s lack of support and poor management, not your decision to stop volunteering under those circumstances.",stop,639,139,778

While the author is trying to act in the best interest of their youngest child's health, the approach of restricting only one child's diet while allowing the others to eat more freely is likely to cause emotional harm, feelings of unfairness, and potentially disordered eating or self-esteem issues for the youngest child. Singling out one child for different treatment based on weight, especially in a visible way, is generally considered harmful parenting practice by experts. A more supportive approach would be to encourage healthy habits for the whole family, focusing on balanced nutrition and activity for everyone, rather than restricting one child and not the others.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, neither you nor your girlfriend is clearly at fault. You communicated your desire to experience a peep show, and your girlfriend explicitly said she was not comfortable going in but was okay with you going in alone. You respected her boundary and went in by yourself. While waiting, you ended up going in with another woman from a group you met in line, but there was no indication of romantic or sexual intent—just a shared, brief, and awkward experience. You were transparent with your girlfriend about what happened immediately afterward.

Your girlfriend initially seemed fine with it, even joking about it, but later expressed discomfort. This may be due to her processing her feelings or discussing it with others, but it does not retroactively make your actions wrong, given the information and boundaries set at the time.

If there is any fault, it may be in communication after the fact, but based on the information provided, nobody acted maliciously or with disregard for the other's feelings. This is a situation where expectations and comfort levels shifted, but not due to anyone's wrongdoing.",stop,706,233,939

The situation is emotionally complex, but the question is about ""fault"" (or, as the original post frames it, ""asshole"" behavior). The author is asking if they're wrong for feeling upset or ""jelly"" (jealous) about their mother's choices and for expressing that frustration. While the mother's behavior is arguably insensitive and perhaps narcissistic, the author admits to being motivated by jealousy and resentment, and their communication with their mother was confrontational and hurtful. The siblings also contributed, but the author is the one who escalated the situation and is questioning their own behavior.

The mother is not obligated to spend her money a certain way, even if her communication is poor. The author, while justified in feeling hurt, is at fault for how they handled and expressed those feelings, especially since they acknowledge their own motivations are at least partly selfish.

The girlfriend explicitly stated she understood and was not offended, even suggesting the original could be a backup.

Explanation: The author is at fault here. The wife’s past sexual history, especially before the relationship, is her own business, and she is not obligated to disclose every detail, especially if she felt ashamed or vulnerable about it. The author’s reaction—feeling betrayed, devaluing his wife, and wanting to separate over her past—shows a lack of empathy and maturity. The author is punishing his wife for something that happened before they met, which is unfair.

The boyfriend's reaction—accusing her of being intolerant, using harsh language, demanding she buy an expensive fursuit, and guilt-tripping her after the breakup—suggests he is at fault for being unreasonable and disrespectful of her boundaries.

Final Answer: Everybody

**Reasoning:**  
There are multiple layers of fault in this situation:

- **Author:** The author is at fault for not setting clear boundaries and expectations with both his fiancée and his best friend. Calling his best friend his ""soul mate"" in front of his fiancée, especially in a heated argument, is insensitive and likely to cause hurt. Additionally, telling his fiancée that he ""loves"" another woman (even platonically) without clarifying the nature of that love is bound to create insecurity and confusion.
- **Fiancée:** The fiancée is at fault for being hostile and for directly criticizing the best friend, which is inappropriate and hurtful. Her request to exclude the best friend from the wedding is also unreasonable if the relationship is truly platonic and important to the author.
- **Best Friend:** While the best friend is not directly at fault in the described events, her continued close presence in the relationship without clear boundaries may contribute to the tension.

**Summary:**  
Both the author and the fiancée have handled the situation poorly, and both share responsibility for the conflict. The author should have communicated better and been more sensitive to his fiancée's feelings, while the fiancée should have addressed her concerns more constructively and respectfully. Therefore, ""Everybody"" is at fault.",stop,596,276,872

Final Answer: Other

Explanation:  
The roommate is at fault here. While rescuing a cat is a kind and commendable act, responsible pet ownership requires ensuring the animal receives proper veterinary care, especially when there are known health concerns (like fleas). Additionally, bringing a pet into a shared living space without the means to care for it, and without a plan for its care during absences, is irresponsible and potentially inconsiderate to roommates.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, it appears to be a case of a friendship that is no longer healthy or mutually supportive. The author is feeling overwhelmed, pressured, and stressed by their friend's behavior, which includes emotional dependence, boundary-pushing, and frequent conflict. The friend, on the other hand, seems to be struggling with trust issues and possibly insecurity, leading to behaviors that are difficult for the author to manage.

However, neither party is acting with clear malice or intent to harm; rather, both are reacting to their own needs and struggles. The author is not at fault for wanting to set boundaries or distance themselves from a friendship that is causing them distress. Similarly, the friend may be acting out of past trauma or insecurity, but that does not make her ""at fault"" in a moral sense—though her actions are problematic.

Therefore, in this context, ""Nobody"" is at fault. The situation is a result of incompatible needs and boundaries, not wrongdoing. The author would not be the asshole (WIBTA) for wanting to step back from the friendship.",stop,799,231,1030

Explanation: The primary responsibility for timely grading and feedback in a university course lies with the instructor and, by extension, the university. While the professor's injuries are unfortunate and understandably caused delays, it was the university's responsibility to ensure continuity of instruction and assessment—such as by providing a substitute grader or alternative arrangements. The student (author) acted reasonably by expressing concern and seeking a solution. The professor's angry response was unprofessional, especially given the student's polite and reasonable request.

Explanation:  
This is a complex situation involving mental health, family dynamics, and personal boundaries. The author is not at fault for following medical advice to protect their own well-being, especially given their own health challenges. The father is suffering from a severe mental illness, which affects his behavior and communication, but this is not a matter of moral fault. The grandmother is elderly and presumably not in a position to provide more support. The situation is unfortunate, but nobody is acting with malice or clear negligence. The author is doing their best in a difficult situation, and the father's actions are a result of his illness, not intentional harm.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, it seems like a classic case of miscommunication and mismatched expectations, rather than clear fault. The author was excited and tried multiple times to involve her husband, who kept postponing without committing to a time. Eventually, the author decided to proceed alone rather than wait indefinitely. The husband was disappointed, but he also did not communicate his desire to be included or set a specific time to do the activity together.

Neither party acted maliciously or with clear disregard for the other's feelings; both had reasonable perspectives. The author wanted to get things done and enjoy the process, while the husband may have wanted to participate but failed to express this clearly or prioritize it. This is a situation where better communication could have prevented hurt feelings, but neither is truly ""at fault"" in a way that warrants blame.",stop,540,179,719

This could have been hurtful, confusing, or even unsafe for the woman involved.

**Reasoning:**  
- The author could have communicated more proactively with his girlfriend about his plans, especially since he knows she has a history of jealousy regarding female friends. This lack of communication can be seen as inconsiderate in the context of their relationship.
- The girlfriend's reaction—sending repeated, berating messages and expressing jealousy—was excessive and not a healthy way to handle her feelings. While it's understandable to feel insecure, her response was disproportionate.
- Both parties contributed to the conflict: the author by not being transparent, and the girlfriend by reacting unreasonably. Therefore, both share responsibility for the situation.",stop,794,138,932

Based on the situation described, the primary source of harm and dysfunction appears to be the husband's behavior: his refusal to seek help for his depression, his emotional withdrawal, anger, and financial control. While depression is an illness and can explain some of his actions, it does not excuse the ongoing emotional neglect, anger, and lack of support for his partner and child. The author has made repeated efforts to communicate, seek therapy, and support him, even moving out for her own well-being and that of their child. The husband's unwillingness to change or seek help until faced with separation, and his continued cycles of anger and withdrawal, place the responsibility for the situation primarily on him.

While you have not cheated, you acknowledge that your behavior with your coworker has sometimes been ""flirty"" and ""a bit too close,"" and that there is an ongoing joke at work about you two being together. These actions, even if not intended romantically, can understandably make your boyfriend uncomfortable, especially if he has observed hugs and frequent one-on-one interactions. On the other hand, your boyfriend is at fault for not communicating his feelings earlier and for holding onto resentment without discussing it with you. Both parties could have handled the situation with more openness and sensitivity. Therefore, some responsibility lies with both you and your boyfriend.",stop,543,141,684

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the information provided, this is a situation where two consenting adults engaged in sexual activity while using contraception, but an unintended pregnancy occurred. James does not want to become a father and wants Emma to have an abortion, while Emma is unsure. Both are entitled to their feelings and choices: Emma has the right to decide whether to continue the pregnancy, and James has the right to express his wishes, though he cannot force her decision.

There is no clear evidence of wrongdoing, coercion, or deception by either party regarding contraception or consent. The argument stems from a difficult, emotionally charged situation, but neither party is ""at fault"" in a moral or legal sense for the pregnancy or for having conflicting desires about the outcome. The situation is unfortunate, but not one where blame can be fairly assigned to either individual.",stop,790,178,968

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
Both parties were transparent about their feelings and limitations. The author was honest about his fear of commitment and desire to explore, and the girlfriend was clear about her needs and boundaries. They mutually agreed on a compromise (the ""green-cards""), and when feelings changed, the girlfriend communicated her discomfort. The author is now pausing to consider her feelings before acting. There is no clear breach of trust or malicious intent; rather, this is a difficult situation with honest communication and evolving emotions.

Final Answer: Info

Explanation:  
The situation describes a young adult living at home, contributing significantly to the household, and feeling restricted by parental rules, especially from the mother. The author feels they deserve more autonomy given their contributions and maturity. However, the question of ""fault"" is complex here: the parents are providing financial support and a home, but the author is also contributing and acting responsibly. The mother's strictness may be excessive, but cultural/family expectations and communication styles are not fully detailed. More information about family agreements, expectations, and communication would be needed to fairly assign fault.",stop,661,127,788

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the main conflict is that the sister (and by extension, the niece) is demanding that the author put their dog away in their own home, and when the author refuses, the sister becomes verbally abusive and causes a scene. The author is not being unreasonable by wanting their dog to be out in their own house, especially since the dog is described as small and not dangerous. The niece's fear of dogs is understandable, but it is the responsibility of her parent(s) to help her manage that fear, not to demand that everyone else accommodate it at all times, especially in their own homes.

The author did not escalate the situation, did not insult anyone, and tried to end the conflict by asking the guests to leave when it became clear that a civil conversation was not possible. The sister, on the other hand, resorted to yelling, name-calling, and making a public scene.

Therefore, the sister (and possibly the niece's parents for not helping her overcome her fear) are at fault here, not the author.",stop,872,230,1102

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the author is at fault for how they communicated their opinion to their friend, L. While the author is factually correct that engineering typically requires a degree (especially in jurisdictions where it is regulated), the issue is not about the accuracy of the information but about the delivery and the impact on their friend. The author admits to saying, “just because you believe the world is one way, doesn’t mean it is,” which comes off as dismissive and condescending, especially in a sensitive conversation about future plans. The author also acknowledges in their edit that their phrasing was ""definitely not great"" and that they never apologized.

While L may have had an unrealistic view and a ""holier than thou"" attitude, the author’s approach was unnecessarily harsh and hurtful, which is why the author is primarily at fault in this interpersonal conflict.",stop,665,189,854

Final Answer: Everybody

Explanation: Both parties contributed to the conflict. The girlfriend displayed intimate memorabilia of her ex (including kissing photos) in shared spaces, which is understandably hurtful and inappropriate in a current relationship, especially since it was visible to their child. The author, while not intentionally keeping his ex’s things out, did have a box of mementos tucked away, but the girlfriend went through his private belongings and discarded items without his consent, which is also a breach of trust and privacy. Both have acted in ways that hurt the other, so responsibility is shared.",stop,458,123,581

Final Answer: Everybody

**Reasoning:**  
- The friend is at fault for touching someone without consent, even if it was just a tap on the shoulder. In social settings, especially bars, personal boundaries are important, and touching a stranger can be perceived as invasive or threatening, regardless of intent.
- The woman is at fault for escalating the situation by yelling and making accusations of ""rape"" for a shoulder tap, which is an extreme and inaccurate characterization of the event. Her reaction, while her discomfort is valid, was disproportionate and inflammatory.
- The author is at fault for continuing to argue with the bartender and defending the friend's actions, rather than accepting that the woman was uncomfortable and that the bar staff wanted to de-escalate the situation.
- The bartender is at fault for handling the situation with hostility and not providing a clear explanation or de-escalating in a more professional manner.

**Summary:**  
Everyone involved contributed to the escalation and discomfort in the situation. The friend should not have touched the woman, the woman overreacted, the author argued instead of de-escalating, and the bartender was unprofessional. Therefore, ""Everybody"" is the most accurate answer.",stop,755,247,1002

You've both tried to compromise, but neither solution has worked well for both parties.

Final Answer: Other

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author arrived on time, looked for his wife in a crowded place, and did not see her immediately. When he did find her, she insulted him in front of others, calling his actions ""pathetic"" and ""dumb,"" and continued to be critical and hostile even after he explained himself and asked for civility. The author then set a clear boundary: he would leave if she continued to be unkind, and when she persisted, he left.

The author’s actions—arriving on time, searching for his wife, calmly explaining himself, and setting a reasonable boundary—do not indicate fault. The wife, on the other hand, was unnecessarily critical, insulting, and dismissive of the author's feelings, both privately and in front of others. The escalation and unpleasantness stemmed from her behavior, not the author's.

Therefore, the wife (categorized as ""Other"" since the author is not at fault) is at fault in this situation.",stop,619,215,834

Explanation:  
The author is at fault in this situation. While her intentions may have been practical and she wanted to support her husband, the way she communicated her thoughts was insensitive and dismissive of his feelings and ambitions. Telling someone who is already feeling like a failure to ""just be a good father and stay at home"" can come across as belittling, especially when paired with comments about his lack of education and being ""dumb.""

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the girlfriend escalated the playful behavior to a level that made the author uncomfortable (smashing a cupcake in his face and then not respecting his wish for privacy when he was upset). The friends also contributed by invading his privacy and trying to take pictures against his will. The author’s initial actions (tickling, encouraging her to get up and dance) were playful and did not cross a clear boundary, especially since the earlier cupcake incident was resolved amicably. The girlfriend and friends did not respect the author’s boundaries when he was clearly upset, and the girlfriend refused to acknowledge his feelings or apologize.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
The author is at fault in this situation. While both parties have some responsibility for their own actions, the specific question is whether the author is at fault for telling her boyfriend to drive faster in areas where he is now being more cautious after receiving multiple speeding tickets. The boyfriend has received three tickets for significant speeding, and is now trying to avoid further tickets by driving at or below the speed limit, especially in areas where the speed limit drops suddenly.

The author admits to encouraging him to speed up, even after he has been ticketed for excessive speeding, and expresses frustration that he is now driving more cautiously. Encouraging someone to break the law (by speeding) and prioritizing punctuality over safety and legality is not reasonable. The boyfriend's new caution is a rational response to repeated tickets and the risk of further consequences.

The situation involves a customer (the author) who was upset about the ski lifts closing early due to wind and sought a partial refund, which was initially denied due to policy. The staff followed their policy and were not personally at fault, and the author, while persistent and perhaps a bit confrontational, ultimately apologized for any rudeness. The closure was due to weather, which is outside anyone's control, and the refund policy was a business decision, not an individual failing.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the author is primarily at fault. While it is understandable to feel stressed and anxious when a friend withdraws, especially if you care about them, the friend has communicated their need for space due to mental health struggles. Expecting a concrete timeline or becoming upset when one isn't provided places additional pressure on someone already struggling. The previous reaction (telling an ex-friend to get out of your life after they ghosted you during a hard time) also suggests a pattern of prioritizing your own needs over the mental health needs of others in crisis. While your feelings are valid, the appropriate response is empathy and patience, not ultimatums or resentment.",stop,452,149,601

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
This situation is a classic case of conflicting priorities and misunderstandings in a relationship, especially when one partner is starting a new career and the other feels neglected or concerned about work-life balance and finances. The partner is enthusiastic about his new job and wants to make a good impression, which is common for someone early in their career. The author is understandably upset about not spending time together and is concerned about unpaid overtime, especially since they share finances.

However, neither party is acting maliciously or with clear disregard for the other. The partner could communicate better and be more considerate of shared plans, while the author could be more understanding of the pressures and excitement of a new job. Both have valid feelings, but neither is clearly ""at fault"" in a way that warrants blame. This is a situation that calls for communication and compromise, not fault-finding.

Explanation: The author admits to being unwilling to compromise at all, despite a history of compromise in the relationship and the partner offering reasonable middle-ground solutions. The partner is not insisting on her way only, but is proposing options that consider both sides. The author's refusal to consider any alternative and insistence on only their own preference makes them primarily at fault in this situation.",stop,635,85,720

Explanation:  
The author and their roommate are at fault here. While it is understandable to be frustrated by noise, especially from neighbors, yelling through the wall at young children (even if ""jokingly"") is inappropriate and potentially distressing for both the children and their parents. The children are very young and likely cannot control their emotions or volume, and the parents may already be doing their best.

Based on the information provided, the primary source of the problematic behavior appears to be the stepkids (and, by extension, their mother, who seems to have encouraged or enabled this behavior). The author and her fiancé have made efforts to be kind, supportive, and maintain a relationship, but have been met with repeated disrespect, theft, and manipulation. The fiancé's desire to maintain contact is understandable given his emotional attachment, but the negative actions described are clearly coming from the stepkids and their mother.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
This situation is primarily about differing standards of cleanliness and comfort in a relationship, not about clear-cut fault. The boyfriend could be seen as inconsiderate for not replacing or thoroughly cleaning stained sheets, especially when sharing his bed with a new partner. However, he did change the sheets when asked. The author is not unreasonable for being grossed out, but demanding the sheets be thrown away may be seen as overstepping, since they are not her property. Both parties have valid feelings, but neither is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral sense—this is a compatibility and communication issue, not a case of wrongdoing.",stop,406,140,546

Final Answer: Everybody

Explanation:  
Both parties have contributed to the situation:

- The author admits to a history of poor time management and being late, which has previously upset his girlfriend. This sets a precedent and may have contributed to a lack of mutual respect for each other's time.
- The girlfriend changed plans last minute, spent extra time with a male coworker, and was late, despite knowing how lateness has been an issue in the relationship. She also seems to hold a double standard, as she would be upset if the roles were reversed.
- Both acknowledge their feelings and the unfairness of the double standard, but neither seems to have fully addressed or resolved the underlying issues.

Final Answer: Everybody

Explanation:  
The author is at fault for not disclosing the presence of a firearm in a shared living space, especially knowing the roommate's strong feelings about guns. Even if the gun is locked up and there are no children, the presence of a firearm can significantly affect a roommate's sense of safety and comfort in their own home. Transparency is important in shared living situations, particularly with something as serious as a firearm.

However, the roommate is also at fault for escalating the situation by calling the author a ""psycho"" and a ""gun nut"" to friends, rather than addressing the issue directly and respectfully. Demanding the author move out or get rid of the gun without a calm discussion is also an overreaction.

Both parties could have handled the situation better: the author by being upfront, and the roommate by responding more maturely. Therefore, ""Everybody"" is the most accurate answer.",stop,375,192,567

Explanation:  
You (the author) are not at fault for not wanting to have sex while you are very sick, pregnant, and exhausted. Consent is essential in any relationship, and your boyfriend's repeated requests and physical advances after you have clearly communicated your boundaries are inappropriate and disrespectful. While he may be stressed and helping out a lot, that does not entitle him to sex, especially when you are unwell and have said no.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the aunt is primarily at fault. She repeatedly targeted the author with offensive, judgmental, and invalidating messages about their mental health, interests, and identity, despite knowing these were sensitive topics. The author responded assertively but not abusively, and their reaction was provoked by a long history of mistreatment. While the author's message was blunt, it was a response to ongoing harm, not an unprovoked attack. The aunt's behavior, including public shaming and rallying others against the author, is the root cause of the conflict.",stop,1086,131,1217

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, neither the author (the retail worker) nor the customer is truly ""at fault"" in a way that would warrant blame. The author is simply following store policy, which requires a rewards card to redeem a coupon. The customer is understandably frustrated, but her forgetting the card is a mistake, not a fault. The author cannot override the system or make exceptions without risking their job or causing inventory/cash discrepancies. The customer’s reaction is emotional but not egregiously out of line.

Based on the situation described, the main issue is the husband's lack of follow-through on commitments made to repair the relationship and help with household tasks, specifically the shelves. While the author has communicated her feelings and needs, the husband has not taken sufficient action to address them, despite being aware of their importance. The author has made efforts to communicate and even attempted to complete the task herself. The husband's willingness to help others but not prioritize his partner's needs is the core issue here.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author appears to be at fault. The girlfriend is working long hours, coming home late, and is understandably tired. The author’s expectation for constant communication and immediate updates about her activities is unreasonable, especially given her work schedule and need for rest. When she did try to communicate, the author responded with frustration and ultimately blocked her, rather than giving her the space or understanding she needed. While the girlfriend’s use of emojis and humor may not have matched the author’s mood, her actions do not warrant the level of annoyance and escalation described. The author’s lack of empathy and overreaction to a minor communication issue makes them primarily at fault in this situation.",stop,816,153,969

The author is at fault here. Even though no physical cheating occurred, making a pact to hook up with someone else if either becomes single—while both are currently in relationships—shows a lack of respect and commitment to their current partner.

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault because they impersonated a lecturer in an email to a friend, which is a serious breach of trust and university IT policy, regardless of their intentions. Even though the author did not intend harm and thought the email would be blocked, the act of sending a spoofed email from a lecturer to a student is inappropriate and can be perceived as harassment or impersonation.

The boyfriend is expressing a desire to be included in an activity with the author and her friends, especially since the author maintains a close friendship with her ex (who is also attending).

You acknowledge that sometimes you ignore requests from production assistants or security to take a detour, especially when you are late or when the detour is unreasonable (e.g., blocking the only entrance/exit).

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault here. While the ""white tie night"" tradition is meant to be a fun, open space for discussion, the author made sweeping, harsh generalizations about journalists and people who go into journalism, calling them ""sociopaths"" and comparing them to ""war profiteers."" These are not just criticisms of the industry, but personal attacks on the character of people who choose that profession. The author did this without knowing that his sister-in-law had recently chosen journalism as her career path, but ignorance does not excuse the level of vitriol expressed.

When confronted, instead of apologizing or softening his stance, the author doubled down and deflected by bringing up a past slight from the sister-in-law, which is not a constructive or mature way to handle the situation. The author’s comments went beyond playful debate and entered the territory of being personally offensive, especially in a family setting.

Explanation: Based on the situation described, the author was subjected to significant emotional, psychological, and eventually physical abuse by their ex-partner, Jessica. The ex-partner's later diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) may help explain some of her behaviors, but it does not excuse or justify abusive actions, especially in the absence of a genuine apology or accountability. The author is not at fault for refusing to forgive or reconcile, especially given the lack of remorse or meaningful change from Jessica. The pressure from Jessica, her mother, and mutual friends to ""forgive and forget"" is inappropriate and shifts blame onto the victim.

Based on the information provided, both parties were consenting adults who made choices regarding alcohol, sex, and contraception. The author acknowledges his mistake in not using protection the first time and took responsible steps afterward (getting the morning-after pill, using condoms subsequently, being clear about relationship intentions, and providing mental health resources when she expressed distress). The woman also made her own choices regarding the relationship and contraception. While the situation is emotionally complex and unfortunate, there is no clear evidence of malicious intent, coercion, or gross negligence by either party after the initial mistake. The emotional fallout is regrettable, but not a matter of ""fault"" in a moral or legal sense. Thus, ""Nobody"" is the most accurate answer.",stop,798,159,957

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, this is a complex case involving trauma, grief, mental health, and family dysfunction. The author’s parents were clearly struggling with their own immense grief and mental health issues after the loss of a child, which led to controlling and neglectful behaviors that negatively impacted the author. However, these behaviors, while harmful, were not necessarily malicious but rather the result of unaddressed trauma and lack of mental health awareness.

The author is not at fault for wanting to protect their own mental health, nor for considering estrangement as a means of self-preservation. The parents, while responsible for their actions, were also victims of circumstance and lacked the tools or knowledge to handle the situation better. The family doctor’s inadequate response is also a systemic issue rather than a personal failing.

Given all this, it is not accurate to assign blame to any one party. The situation is tragic and the result of a combination of unfortunate events, lack of support, and generational gaps in understanding mental health. Therefore, nobody is singularly at fault.",stop,889,226,1115

The author is at fault because he is considering keeping the relationship going with the girl while also wanting to pursue other girls, despite knowing that this would hurt her. He acknowledges that she is very emotionally invested and that breaking up would hurt her, but he is also contemplating cheating or stringing her along until his feelings fade. This is unfair to the girl, as it is dishonest and manipulative to keep her emotionally attached while not being fully committed or honest about his intentions.

The author is at fault here. While the relationship was complicated and there were trust issues, the author admits to repeatedly snooping on their partner—first earlier in the relationship, which led to a breakup, and then again by looking up her gaming activity without her knowledge. This is a clear violation of privacy and trust, regardless of the author's emotional state or suspicions. The partner's reaction, while harsh, is understandable given the repeated breach of trust.

This situation is a minor misunderstanding between siblings about birthday wishes. The author did make an effort to wish their sister a happy birthday, and the sister seems to have missed or forgotten to reciprocate. The author brought it up late at night, which may have made the conversation more tense, but their feelings are understandable. The sister's response is defensive, but also understandable given the timing and the nature of the complaint.

Neither party acted maliciously or with clear fault; it's a case of miscommunication and hurt feelings, not wrongdoing. Therefore, ""Nobody"" is at fault.",stop,759,130,889

This situation is a classic case of a friendship drifting apart due to lack of communication, possible misunderstandings, and unspoken feelings. There is no clear evidence of malice or wrongdoing from either party—just hurt feelings, confusion, and perhaps mismatched expectations. The author is not ""the asshole"" for feeling hurt or for eventually disengaging, nor is the friend clearly at fault for withdrawing (possibly for personal reasons). Without more information about the friend's circumstances, it's not fair to assign blame. This is a sad but common scenario where nobody is truly at fault.",stop,742,125,867

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the author stayed in the relationship out of concern for their girlfriend's emotional well-being during a difficult time, despite having lost romantic feelings. While this may have led to some emotional confusion or pain, the intention was to be supportive, not malicious or selfish. The author is now considering ending the relationship, which is a reasonable and honest step given their feelings. There is no clear wrongdoing or malice from either party; rather, it is a complex, emotionally difficult situation. Therefore, ""Nobody"" is at fault.",stop,475,123,598

**Reasoning:**  
You are not at fault for feeling upset or disappointed—feelings are natural and not inherently wrong. She is also not at fault for not reciprocating your romantic feelings or for needing space after you asked her out. It’s understandable that you’re hurt, but she has the right to her boundaries and feelings, just as you do.

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the author and their suitemate provided significant help to M, allowing her to stay rent-free and with minimal expectations, except for a clear and reasonable boundary: not to use their home as a refuge from a relationship she kept returning to. M repeatedly broke this agreement, lied about her actions, and disregarded the one condition set by her friends. While the confrontation could perhaps have been handled with more empathy, the core issue is M's repeated dishonesty and disregard for the boundaries set by those helping her.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the author overheard a private (albeit mean-spirited) conversation and then publicly told A, in a way that was ""maybe a bit loudly,"" that her friends were insulting her and possibly tampered with her food. While the other two girls were clearly being unkind and possibly malicious, the author’s decision to intervene—especially in a public and dramatic way—caused immediate distress to A, who left the lecture upset.

The author’s intentions may have been good (not wanting A to be mistreated), but the way the information was delivered was likely harmful and disruptive. A more considerate approach would have been to discreetly warn A or encourage her to be cautious, rather than making a scene. The author’s actions directly caused harm to A in the moment, and possibly escalated the situation unnecessarily.

Therefore, the author is most at fault for how they handled the situation, even though the other girls were also behaving badly. The question is ""AITA?"" (Am I the asshole?), so the answer focuses on the author’s responsibility.",stop,557,232,789

Explanation:  
While the ex's communication and framing to the kids is problematic, the author is at fault for rigidly prioritizing their ""appointed time"" over a special, likely once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for their children (a week-long family reunion at Disneyland). The author is not considering the children's best interests or happiness, instead focusing on strict adherence to the custody schedule and their own grievances with the ex. The refusal to compromise or switch weeks, even when offered, shows inflexibility and a lack of empathy for the kids' desires. The ex's behavior is not ideal, but the author is the one actively preventing the children from attending the event. Thus, the author is most at fault in this situation.",stop,833,157,990

Both the author and his wife share some responsibility for the conflict:

He also did not communicate his discomfort earlier or try to find a more constructive way to address the situation.
- **Wife's Fault:** She failed to communicate the full expectations of the honeymoon in advance, putting her husband in an uncomfortable position. She also escalated the situation by leaving abruptly and cutting off communication, rather than trying to resolve the conflict together.

Based on the situation described, the author is at fault for wanting to completely abdicate all responsibility—financial, emotional, and legal—for a child that is biologically his, simply because he does not want to be a parent. While it is understandable that the situation is distressing and not what he wanted, once a child is conceived, both parents have moral and legal responsibilities to the child, regardless of their personal wishes. The concept of a ""financial abortion"" (unilaterally opting out of all responsibility) is not legally recognized in most jurisdictions, and morally, it is generally considered wrong to abandon one's child.

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the author is being inflexible and holding a grudge against their brother for missing a birthday due to a long drive and work the next day, even though the brother is trying to make amends by offering a mini party. While the brother could arguably have made more effort, the author’s refusal to accept the gesture of reconciliation and their rigid stance (""I don't believe in do overs"") suggests a lack of understanding and forgiveness. In most social contexts, accepting an apology or a make-up gesture is considered reasonable, especially when the absence was not due to malice.

Explanation:  
The author is at fault here. While it can be frustrating to listen to someone repeat the same stories or topics, the way the author responded was dismissive and hurtful. Instead of communicating their feelings in a considerate way or redirecting the conversation, the author bluntly told their friend that they weren't interested and that the conversation was meaningless. This invalidated the friend's excitement and cultural pride, which understandably hurt her feelings. A more empathetic approach would have been to gently steer the conversation or express their feelings without demeaning the other person's interests.",stop,510,124,634

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, neither party is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. The author is understandably frustrated by repeated cancellations and lack of communication, while the girl may have legitimate work constraints or other reasons for her behavior. The author’s choice to stop communicating is a personal boundary rather than an act of malice. While some might consider ""ghosting"" impolite, it is not inherently wrong given the repeated letdowns.

Final Answer: Info

Explanation:  
This is a highly sensitive and complex situation involving trust, boundaries, and concerns for child safety. The author is not at fault for feeling unsettled or for confronting her fiancé about his porn habits, especially given the nature of the content and her parental instincts. However, the fiancé's actions—viewing and participating in incest-themed online communities—raise legitimate concerns, but do not, by themselves, prove any actual risk to the children without further context or evidence of inappropriate behavior.

Determining ""fault"" here is difficult without more information:
- Is there any evidence of actual risk or inappropriate behavior toward the children?
- Has the fiancé explained his actions in a way that addresses the author's concerns?
- Is the author's response (not letting him change diapers or be alone with the children) proportional to the actual risk, or is it based on fear and disgust alone?

Because the situation involves both emotional reactions and potential safety concerns, and because the fiancé's online activity, while disturbing, does not necessarily equate to real-world danger, more information is needed to fairly assign fault.",stop,535,229,764

Explanation: The main issue here is Harriet's behavior—she pushed food onto a child’s plate after he declined, and then got upset when he didn’t eat it.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the information provided, the author was banned from r/legaladvice and r/bestoflegaladvice after using curse words and calling a moderator ""an absolute jerk"" in a message exchange. The author admits to using strong language and acknowledges that their tone may have triggered the moderator. While moderators can sometimes be overly strict, Reddit communities generally have clear rules about civility and respectful communication, especially when interacting with moderators. Using profanity and insults toward moderators is almost always against subreddit rules and is a common reason for bans.

The author also questions the moderation decision about locking a post for not having a question mark, but this is a separate issue. The main reason for the ban appears to be the author's conduct in their messages, not the content of their argument.

Therefore, the author is at fault for violating subreddit rules regarding respectful communication.",stop,461,186,647

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author posted a tweet containing profanity and a personal insult directed at the referees, which violated the school's code of conduct regarding respect and use of language. While the author may feel the referees made mistakes, the response (publicly insulting them with profanity) is a clear violation of school policy, and the consequences (disciplinary action) are a direct result of the author's actions. The school and staff are enforcing established rules, and there is no evidence of unfair targeting beyond the author's own violation. Therefore, the author is at fault.",stop,551,129,680

Final Answer: Everybody

Reasoning:  
Both parties contributed to the misunderstanding and escalation. Mitch, as the after-party host who invited everyone to his place, could reasonably be expected to cover or at least not request reimbursement for the cab fare to his own home, especially since the group was going there at his suggestion and he insisted he was fine to host. On the other hand, the author and their husband could have communicated more clearly about expectations for splitting transportation costs, especially since splitting cabs is a common practice among friends in cities. The situation escalated into a text fight, indicating a breakdown in communication and empathy on both sides. Therefore, everyone shares some responsibility for the conflict.",stop,867,145,1012

Explanation:  
Based on the information provided, the author is primarily at fault. While the girlfriend could have communicated her financial struggles more openly, she had previously expressed her boundaries and embarrassment about her financial situation, which is understandable given her background and recent medical debt. The author, who is in a much stronger financial position, responded dismissively and with a lack of empathy when his girlfriend asked for a small amount of money for food, especially after she had just paid for a meal she barely ate. The author's reaction—snapping at her and refusing to help with $2—demonstrates a lack of compassion and understanding, especially given the context of her financial stress and her history of frugality. The girlfriend's request was not unreasonable, and the author's response was unnecessarily harsh. Therefore, the author is at fault in this situation.",stop,954,180,1134

Based on the situation, the author has clearly communicated their boundaries and reasons for not using social media, which are consistent and not targeted at the partner specifically.

The friend is also escalating the situation with advice that seems rooted in her own insecurities and relationship issues.

While the boyfriend's feelings and possible internalized issues are important, the author repeatedly pushed the topic of his sexuality after he expressed discomfort and insisted on his own identity. Even if the author meant well and wanted to be supportive, continuing to question or label someone after they've asked you not to is disrespectful of their boundaries.

On the other hand, M's reaction was disproportionate (screaming and ending the friendship over a single comment), and she may have projected her own insecurities or frustrations onto the author.

**Reasoning:**  
In this situation, nobody is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. The author is justified in not wanting someone at their wedding who has been openly hostile and disparaging toward them and their fiancé. Sharon's behavior is unpleasant, but she is not obligated to be friendly, and the author is not obligated to invite her. The fiancé's concern about etiquette and Paul's feelings is reasonable, but not a matter of fault. This is a clash of personalities and boundaries, not a case of wrongdoing.

**Reasoning:**  
The primary issue described in the situation is the mother's abusive and emotionally volatile behavior toward her children, including physical and verbal abuse, which is never justified regardless of the children's or father's shortcomings in household contributions. While the author acknowledges some personal and familial flaws (e.g., not helping enough around the house, the father's emotional distance), these do not excuse or cause the mother's abusive actions. The responsibility for abuse lies solely with the abuser, not the victims or bystanders, even if the household is not functioning perfectly otherwise.

The author and father may have areas for improvement, but the core problem—abuse and mistreatment—is the mother's responsibility. Therefore, the mother (i.e., ""Other"") is at fault for the abusive behavior described.",stop,1557,166,1723

Explanation: While it's understandable to be frustrated when you get sick, blaming your mom for not taking the specific medicines you prefer is unfair. Adults have the right to manage their own illnesses as they see fit, and over-the-counter cold medicines generally treat symptoms, not the underlying virus or its contagiousness. There is no strong evidence that taking these medicines would have prevented her from being contagious or you from getting sick.

This situation is emotionally charged and involves miscommunication, but neither party is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. Both you and your girlfriend are dealing with a difficult situation (an impending move, uncertainty about long-distance relationships, and mutual emotional struggles). She did not intend to deceive you; she was trying to spare your feelings, and you were reacting to feeling blindsided and hurt. Both of you could have communicated more clearly, but the circumstances are complicated and not the result of malice or clear wrongdoing. Therefore, nobody is strictly ""at fault"" here.",stop,624,128,752

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault here, primarily for two reasons:

1. **Maintaining a Folder of Past Hookups' Photos:**  
While keeping a personal diary or memento of past experiences is not inherently wrong, creating and maintaining a folder of photos of people you've had sex with—without their knowledge or consent—can be considered disrespectful to their privacy. Even if the photos are not nudes and are publicly available, the intent and context (a ""visual diary"" of sexual partners) crosses a line for many people. This is especially true when entering a new, serious relationship.

2. **Not Wanting to Delete the Folder:**  
Once in a committed relationship, especially after your partner has expressed clear discomfort and hurt over the existence of this folder, refusing to delete it shows a lack of empathy and respect for your partner's feelings. While you may not have intended harm, relationships require compromise and consideration of each other's boundaries.

**The boyfriend's reaction (anger, leaving, not responding) is understandable given the context, though perhaps a more mature conversation would be ideal. However, the primary fault lies with the author for both creating and wanting to keep the folder despite knowing it hurts their partner.**",stop,551,260,811

Explanation:  
- The son is at fault for bullying a special needs student.
- The stepmother is at fault for physically disciplining a child who is not her own, which is a sensitive and controversial issue, especially without the biological mother's consent.
- The father is at fault for delegating physical discipline to the stepmother and not handling the situation himself.
- The author is at fault for focusing more on her anger at the stepmother than on her son's bullying, and for escalating the situation rather than seeking a constructive solution.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, this is a case of conflicting values and expectations within a relationship, not a clear-cut case of one party being ""at fault."" The author is expressing frustration about perceived double standards and a mismatch in values regarding gender roles, finances, and chores. The wife holds traditional views in some areas and more modern views in others, which is causing tension. However, neither party is described as behaving maliciously or abusively; rather, they have fundamental differences in expectations and communication.

This is a common relationship issue that often requires open communication or counseling to resolve. Therefore, ""Nobody"" is at fault in a moral sense—it's a compatibility and communication issue, not a matter of wrongdoing.",stop,534,157,691

Both parties share some fault here. The author continued to use the hook without clarifying ownership after being told (albeit while drunk) not to, and then forgot or ignored the request. The roommate, on the other hand, responded in a passive-aggressive and escalatory way (hiding the towel, sticky notes) rather than having a direct, clear conversation.

The author is frustrated that his wife seems to be minimizing his suffering, but there is no clear wrongdoing or malice from either party—just a clash of perspectives under stress.

Based on the situation, the author is knowingly breaking a clearly posted house rule (""no eating in the rooms"") in response to their food being taken from the shared fridge. While the theft of food is wrong and the other roommates are at fault for that, the specific question is ""Am I the asshole?""—meaning, is the author at fault for eating in their room?

There are multiple layers of resentment, poor communication, and boundary issues in this scenario. The author is understandably upset about feeling like a ""second choice"" and about the boyfriend's lack of assertiveness with his ex. The boyfriend is at fault for not setting clear boundaries with his ex and for not being transparent with his mother. The ex-girlfriend took advantage of the boyfriend's generosity. The boyfriend's mother is unwittingly involved but is not at fault unless she is intentionally undermining the relationship.

Explanation:  
While the situation describes persistent and inappropriate behavior from the coworker (which is absolutely wrong and constitutes harassment), the author's response—making a cruel, body-shaming comment—crosses a line. Responding to harassment with a personal, hurtful insult about someone's appearance is not justified, even in a frustrating situation. The correct course would have been to continue to set boundaries, document the behavior, and escalate to management or HR, even if the author felt it would not be taken seriously. Resorting to body-shaming is not an appropriate or acceptable response. Therefore, the author is at fault for their specific action, even though the coworker is also clearly in the wrong for her behavior.

Based on the situation, nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a way that warrants blame. The author was caring for their child appropriately (three layers, covered, mid-50s weather), and the older man was acting out of concern, albeit in a culturally different and perhaps intrusive way. The author responded defensively, which is understandable given repeated unsolicited comments, but not egregiously rude.

Explanation: The person in question (the sister-in-law) is at fault for refusing to take responsibility for her own transportation needs, despite having the means to do so at times, and for repeatedly relying on others for rides while dismissing reasonable alternatives (bus, taxi, etc.). The author has communicated boundaries and is not obligated to provide rides, especially after long work shifts. The pressure and guilt-tripping from the sister-in-law (and possibly mother-in-law) are unfair. Therefore, ""Other"" is the most accurate answer.",stop,416,119,535

Explanation:  
This is a complex, emotionally charged situation involving health, stress, and care. The author is clearly trying to be supportive and is motivated by concern for his wife and unborn child. The wife, meanwhile, is under significant stress from pregnancy, work, school, and managing a difficult medical condition. Her reaction—frustration and anger—seems to be a result of accumulated stress and feeling overwhelmed, rather than malice or neglect.

Neither party is acting out of ill intent. The author’s reminders, while well-meaning, may feel like nagging to someone already under pressure, but they are not unreasonable given the health stakes. The wife’s reaction, though emotional, is understandable given her circumstances.

Therefore, in this situation, nobody is truly ""at fault."" Both are doing their best under difficult circumstances, and the conflict arises from stress and concern rather than wrongdoing.",stop,809,191,1000

The boyfriend is also in a tough position, trying to be a good father under challenging circumstances. While communication could be improved on both sides, neither party is acting maliciously or unreasonably given the context.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
This is a difficult and emotionally charged situation, but based on the information provided, nobody is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. The author is setting a boundary for their own well-being, which is reasonable given the ongoing drama and emotional toll. Michael is making his own choices, even if they are unwise, and Amy's behavior is problematic, but the author is not responsible for Michael's decisions or Amy's actions. The author did not act maliciously; they simply chose to step away from a situation that was causing them distress. Therefore, ""Nobody"" is the most appropriate answer.",stop,779,138,917

Final Answer: Everybody

**Reasoning:**  
This is a complex and emotionally charged situation with significant moral and practical consequences. Both parties have made questionable decisions:

- **Author:** The author is at fault for refusing to take any part in their child's life, despite being aware of the child's existence and needs. While paying child support is a legal obligation, emotional and parental involvement is also important for the child's well-being. The author also pressured C into an abortion and gave an ultimatum, which is ethically problematic.
- **C (the ex-girlfriend):** C is at fault for not being transparent about her pregnancy and for possibly manipulating the situation to fulfill her own desires, despite knowing the author's wishes. If she intentionally concealed the pregnancy or stopped contraception without informing the author, that is a serious breach of trust.
- **Shared Responsibility:** Both parties engaged in unprotected sex, and both bear responsibility for the consequences. Communication and mutual respect were lacking on both sides.

Given the above, **everybody** involved bears some responsibility for the outcome. The situation is not solely the fault of one person.",stop,1008,230,1238

Explanation:  
Based on the information provided, nobody is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. The author did not initiate any inappropriate behavior and was transparent with their girlfriend about the situation. The girlfriend communicated her feelings and boundaries after the fact, which is a healthy part of any relationship. Annie's actions (playing with hair, holding hands) may be boundary-pushing, but the author did not encourage or reciprocate in a way that suggests wrongdoing.

This is a very emotionally complex situation, but based on the information provided, **nobody is clearly at fault**. You have acted thoughtfully and respectfully by first reaching out to the boy’s mother and not contacting him directly. You are considering the emotional impact on him and his family, and you are seeking advice before taking further action. The mother’s lack of response is not necessarily “fault”—she may be protecting her son or simply not ready to engage. Your mother is giving her opinion, but not pressuring you.

No one in this scenario is behaving maliciously or irresponsibly. Everyone is navigating a difficult, sensitive family situation as best they can. Therefore, **nobody is at fault**.",stop,827,154,981

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the information provided, the author (landlord) appears to have acted reasonably and in accordance with the rental agreement.

The flea issue was addressed promptly by the author, and the tenants' claim that this justifies breaking the lease without notice is not supported by the facts as presented.

Explanation:  
The author is at fault because they intentionally misrepresented the size of the house in order to pay for fewer hours of cleaning than the app would have required for the actual number of rooms. This is a form of dishonesty and is unfair to the cleaner, who accepted the job based on the information provided. The cleaner's frustration is understandable, as the job was not as described and could have affected their schedule or expectations for compensation.

Explanation:  
The mother is clearly at fault for years of severe abuse, which is never justified. However, the author acknowledges that their recent response—telling their mother ""why not do it, then"" in response to a suicidal statement—was cruel and harmful, even if it was a reaction to trauma. While the mother's actions created the environment and pain that led to the author's response, the specific act of telling someone to kill themselves is also wrong, regardless of context.

Explanation:  
The author is at fault because his opposition to his wife's pursuit of graduate school and a higher-paying career is based solely on his own feelings of insecurity and traditional gender roles, not on any practical or mutual concern. His wife supported him during his education, and now she has the opportunity to pursue her own dreams with her parents' support.

- The bystander (FB) also escalated things by yelling and cursing.

The husband feels guilty, which is understandable, but he is not taking more action himself either.

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, nobody is clearly at fault in a way that warrants blame. The old man made a comment that could be considered rude or judgmental about your wife's tattoo, but he did not escalate the situation further. You, as the host, set a boundary and asked him to leave after he expressed offense at your wife's tattoo, which is within your rights, especially since he was a guest in your home and made a negative comment about your spouse.

The subsequent estrangement between the old man and your wife's family seems to be more about his own choices and feelings than any direct action you took. You did not insult him or act aggressively; you simply ended the visit after he made an unwelcome comment. The old man may have felt embarrassed or unwelcome, but that does not make you ""at fault"" for the family falling out, nor does it make him solely to blame.

This is a situation where social expectations, generational differences, and personal boundaries clashed, but no one acted with clear malice or egregious disrespect. Therefore, ""Nobody"" is the most accurate answer.",stop,505,240,745

Instead of listening, validating her feelings, or apologizing for the impact of their words, the author doubled down, said ""I don't care,"" and told her to ""not get offended about such little things.""

Explanation:  
The situation involves multiple parties making questionable decisions:

- The author used physical intimidation and inappropriate slurs, which is not an appropriate or safe way to handle the situation, even if the intent was to protect a roommate.
- The unknown man is at fault for being in the house uninvited, yelling at a resident, and creating a threatening situation.
- The other roommates were present and yelling, but it’s unclear if they tried to de-escalate or call for help.

While the author’s intent may have been protective, the use of slurs and physical aggression is not justified. The unknown man is clearly at fault for his threatening behavior. The roommates may share some responsibility for not handling the situation more safely (e.g., calling campus security or police).

**Reasoning:**  
The author made a comment (""wow, you're massive!"") to a pregnant former co-worker. While the intent may have been to acknowledge her pregnancy, the choice of words was insensitive and could easily be interpreted as rude or offensive, regardless of the context or the former co-worker's usual demeanor. The manager's reaction, while perhaps blunt, was a response to the author's comment. The former co-worker's awkward reaction and lack of a goodbye suggest she was uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is at fault for making an inappropriate comment, even if unintentionally.",stop,560,127,687

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, nobody is currently at fault. The author and FA are concerned about their friend's (FB's) enjoyment and comfort, not trying to exclude him maliciously.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation: Based on the situation described, the author was in a difficult friendship where the other person repeatedly disrespected boundaries, took advantage financially, and encouraged unhealthy behaviors. The author chose to end the friendship by ghosting, which is not the most communicative or mature way to end a relationship, but given the context (high school, feeling taken advantage of, and concern for personal well-being), it is understandable. The friend’s behavior was clearly problematic, but the author’s decision to cut off contact was a self-protective response rather than an act of malice. While the author wonders if they could have handled it better, there is no clear wrongdoing that rises to the level of being ""at fault"" in a moral sense. Both parties acted according to their own interests and limitations, and the situation is more about incompatibility and self-preservation than fault.",stop,845,187,1032

Explanation:  
The author is at fault here for calling the drunk man a ""degenerate"" in a derogatory way, even if it was only in a private chat. The term is dehumanizing and unnecessarily cruel, regardless of the context or the author's bad day. The friend was right to call out the author for targeting an individual with harsh language.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation: The author is at fault here, though not in a malicious way. The disappointment stems from the author's own assumptions and biases about what kind of friendship or validation he wanted—specifically, wanting acceptance from a straight, ""masculine"" man. While it's understandable to have expectations, being disappointed that someone is gay (when it doesn't affect their friendship or shared interests) reflects an internalized bias. The author is not being overtly hostile or discriminatory, but the feeling of disappointment is rooted in a stereotype about what kind of men can provide the validation he seeks. Thus, the author is at fault for this reaction, even if it's a mild and self-reflective one.",stop,726,150,876

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, nobody is clearly at fault. The author is being upfront about their boundaries and expectations regarding paternity, which is a reasonable precaution given their past experience. They are not accusing anyone of infidelity, but rather stating a personal policy to protect themselves from a potentially life-altering mistake. The ex-girlfriend who faked a pregnancy is at fault in that specific incident, but the main question here is about the author's general approach to paternity testing in future relationships.

The author is not forcing anyone to agree with their stance, and potential partners are free to accept or reject this condition. The author is also not making accusations, just stating a requirement for their own peace of mind. While some people may find this approach untrusting or unnecessary, it is not inherently wrong or harmful if communicated respectfully and honestly.

Therefore, in the context of the author's general policy and approach, nobody is at fault.",stop,650,201,851

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, neither party is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. The author (you) set a boundary by choosing not to associate with someone whose beliefs you find hurtful or incompatible with your identity. The Christian boy expressed his beliefs, which are consistent with his religious upbringing, but did not act with overt hostility or aggression—he even tried to clarify that he does not hate gay people, though his beliefs are still problematic from your perspective.

You are not obligated to forgive or maintain a friendship with someone whose views make you uncomfortable or feel unsafe. At the same time, he did not attack you personally or act maliciously; he simply stated his beliefs, however insensitive they may feel to you. This is a case of incompatible values, not clear wrongdoing.

Based on the situation described, nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense.

Explanation: Based on the situation described, ""A"" (the friend) is at fault.

Your decision to avoid her at a social event is a reasonable boundary after such a betrayal.

Final Answer: Everybody

**Reasoning:**  
This is a classic ""Everybody Sucks Here"" (ESH) situation, as both the author and the roommate (and to a lesser extent, the girlfriend) contributed to the breakdown of the living arrangement and friendship.

- **Author's Faults:**  
  - Admits to having a ""tone problem"" and setting strict boundaries that may have been difficult for the roommate and his girlfriend to navigate.
  - Made a joke that was interpreted as inappropriate, which contributed to discomfort.
  - Eavesdropped on private conversations.
  - Raised rent as a reaction to conflict, which, while not inherently wrong, was poorly timed and perceived as punitive.
  - Did not communicate needs and frustrations clearly or in a timely manner, leading to resentment and passive-aggressive behavior.

- **Roommate's Faults:**  
  - Became lax with agreed-upon chores and responsibilities.
  - Did not respect the author's boundaries regarding guests and noise.
  - Invited his girlfriend over without considering the author's comfort or schedule.
  - Moved out abruptly without proper notice, leaving the author in a difficult financial situation.

- **Girlfriend's Faults:**  
  - Ignored the author's request for space and forced a confrontation.
  - Was present in the apartment frequently despite the author's discomfort.

**Summary:**  
Both parties failed to communicate effectively and respect each other's boundaries, leading to escalating tension and ultimately a breakdown in the relationship. The girlfriend's actions also contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the most accurate answer is ""Everybody.""",stop,2354,325,2679

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault in this situation. Both partners work full-time jobs, and the expectation that the girlfriend should do all the cleaning and laundry—especially because it is her profession—reflects an unfair division of labor at home. The author’s reasoning (“she’s good at it,” “my mom always did it better,” “I work more hours”) does not justify expecting his partner to do all the domestic work, especially when she has expressed being tired of it and upset. The author’s reaction to her stopping (anger, calling her an asshole, threatening to move out) further demonstrates a lack of empathy and unwillingness to share household responsibilities.

Both the author and Kara contributed to the escalation of the conflict. Kara made an unkind, judgmental comment about the author ""only caring about money,"" which was inappropriate and dismissive of the author's circumstances. The author responded with a sarcastic and pointed retort about Kara's own financial situation, which, while arguably justified as a defense, was also personal and likely to provoke further conflict. Both parties engaged in behavior that escalated the situation rather than de-escalating or communicating constructively. Therefore, both share responsibility for the fallout.",stop,825,124,949

**Reasoning:**  
The author left quarters on their dresser for laundry, not as a tip. The housekeeper took the quarters, assuming they were a tip, and left a note. The author reported the missing quarters to the front desk, who reimbursed them and took the note. The author is questioning if they were wrong to report it.

- The author did not do anything wrong by reporting missing property, especially since the quarters were not clearly marked as a tip.
- The housekeeper made an assumption and took something that was not explicitly given as a tip, which is not appropriate, even if it was an honest mistake.
- The front desk handled the situation professionally and reimbursed the author.

Therefore, the person at fault is the housekeeper (i.e., ""Other""), for taking something that was not clearly intended for them. The author is not at fault for reporting the incident.",stop,725,192,917

The author is at fault for drinking the women's drinks while they were outside, which is a clear breach of social norms and courtesy. While the author felt slighted by the women not reciprocating the round of drinks, their response was disproportionate and petty. The women were not obligated to buy drinks, and their behavior, while perhaps dismissive, did not justify the author's action of consuming drinks that were not theirs. The author acknowledges their own ""asshole behavior,"" and the escalation was initiated by their own choice. Thus, the author is primarily at fault in this situation.",stop,1052,130,1182

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the main issue is the husband's lack of participation in nighttime and morning baby care, as well as household duties, even during weekends and holidays when both parents are home. The author is expressing frustration at the imbalance and has attempted to communicate this. The husband's reaction to being thanked, but then feeling hurt when the author pointed out the ongoing imbalance, suggests he is not acknowledging the disproportionate burden on his partner.

While the author's comment (""Now you can appreciate more what I do every night"") may have stung, it is a reasonable and honest expression of her feelings, especially given the context of ongoing frustration and lack of support. The core problem is the husband's refusal to share responsibilities, not the author's communication about it.

Therefore, the husband (Other) is primarily at fault for not sharing the load and for being unreceptive to feedback about the imbalance.",stop,847,194,1041

Based on the situation described, you (the author) have not done anything inherently wrong by visiting a public place where your ex works, especially since you avoided it for ten months out of respect and only went after he re-initiated contact. You are not seeking confrontation or trying to make him uncomfortable; you simply want to enjoy a venue you like. Your ex is also not at fault for feeling uncomfortable—those are his feelings to manage.

- **Author (You)**: You had sex with your friend's boyfriend, even if the relationship was dysfunctional and the situation was complicated. While the circumstances were messy and you were hurt by Haley, it was still a betrayal of trust.

Based on the situation, the author’s mother is explicitly inviting the family out and stating that she wants to pay, understanding their financial situation and wanting to treat them.

The sister, on the other hand, is creating tension by insisting that the mother should not pay for anyone, despite the mother’s wishes and the author’s financial constraints.

While the author admits to losing her temper and screaming, this is a reaction to prolonged stress and abuse, not the root cause of the problem. The request to see the bank account is a reasonable response to repeated dishonesty. The husband's actions are the primary cause of the conflict and harm in the relationship.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author is asking if they are at fault (""AITA"") for not wanting to see their grandmother again, despite the grandmother being kind to them personally. However, the author is aware of the grandmother's history of favoritism, verbal and physical abuse, manipulation, and ongoing mistreatment of other family members, including the author's own parents and siblings.

While some people may expect the author to continue seeing their grandmother out of familial duty or because she was kind to them, it is reasonable and justified for the author to set boundaries with someone who has caused significant harm to their loved ones, even if that person was personally kind to them. The author is not at fault for choosing to protect their own well-being and support their immediate family.

Therefore, the author is **not** at fault for not wanting to see their grandmother. The person who suggested the author should ""give her the comfort of her favorite grandchild before she dies"" is not considering the full context of the grandmother's behavior.

However, since the question is ""AITA for not wanting or caring to see her ever again?"" and the options require choosing who is at fault, the correct answer is:

Based on your description, the primary escalation and physical aggression came from your father. While there was shouting and some disrespectful language from both sides, your father's actions—threatening to turn off the power, unplugging and taking your electronics, getting physically close in a threatening manner, grabbing your leg, and making gestures as if to punch—are clear examples of inappropriate and potentially abusive behavior. Your mother, while a bystander, did not intervene to de-escalate or protect you, but the main fault for the escalation and violence lies with your father.

You, as a 16-year-old, may have contributed to the argument by shouting and swearing, but this is a typical teenage response under stress and does not justify the adult's aggressive and threatening behavior. The situation was not handled well by the adults, who are responsible for maintaining a safe and supportive environment.

The author then confronted the coach, further escalating the situation. The author's mother then took it even further by yelling and almost physically confronting the coach. Each party contributed to the escalation and poor behavior, so responsibility is shared among all involved.",stop,851,87,938

Based on the information provided, the author (you) did not intentionally kick your father; it was an involuntary reaction while being mostly asleep, and you tried to apologize afterward. Your father, on the other hand, responded with disproportionate anger, shouting, and threats, despite knowing about your history of violent sleep reactions. While the situation is unfortunate, the primary fault lies with your father for escalating the situation and not handling it with understanding, especially given your known sleep issues.",stop,423,111,534

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, Kevin's girlfriend is primarily at fault. She interjected and overruled plans that had already been made between you and Kevin, disregarded your question, and escalated the situation by telling others you had anger issues. While your reaction (yelling) was not ideal, it was provoked by her disrespectful and controlling behavior. Kevin himself tried to mediate and was not at fault, and you made efforts to clarify and apologize afterward. The main issue stemmed from the girlfriend's actions, so ""Other"" is the most accurate answer.",stop,626,131,757

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, nobody is truly at fault. Saul, due to his Asperger's and difficulty reading social cues, likely did not realize the pressure he was putting on the author by asking in front of the class. The author, feeling uncomfortable and pressured by the public setting, said yes to avoid social scrutiny but later clarified her feelings honestly and kindly. Both parties acted with good intentions and communicated openly afterward. There is no clear wrongdoing or malice from either side, so ""Nobody"" is at fault.",stop,427,118,545

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the information provided, nobody is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. Here’s why:

- Tom and Sally were never in a serious, mutually agreed-upon relationship; Tom misrepresented the situation, and Sally went along to spare his feelings.
- After their brief ""relationship,"" Sally and Tom broke up, and Sally and the author became close friends over the summer, developing mutual feelings.
- The sexual encounter between the author and Sally happened when both were single and consenting adults (albeit drunk and blacked out, which is a separate issue but not one of betrayal).
- The author was honest with Tom about what happened, and Tom initially forgave him.
- Tom’s subsequent coldness seems to stem from his own unresolved feelings, not from any clear wrongdoing by the author or Sally.

While feelings are hurt, and the situation is emotionally complicated, there is no clear breach of trust or malicious intent. The author acted with honesty, and Sally was not in a relationship with Tom at the time. Therefore, nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a way that warrants blame.",stop,589,238,827

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
The author made a conscious decision to drop their friend off at detox, knowing it would result in a significant hospital bill and without the friend's informed consent. While the friend's alcoholism and risky behavior are serious issues, the specific incident in question is about the author's choice to handle the situation in a way that was partly motivated by frustration and a desire to ""teach a lesson,"" rather than out of immediate medical necessity (the author admits they could have taken care of her at home). The friend was not in a state to consent, and the author also lied about what happened afterward. While the friend's actions are problematic, in this scenario, the author is at fault for how they handled the incident.",stop,822,152,974

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
The author left a bottle of wine out, which could be seen as a minor mistake, but it was clearly a gift and not communal property. The roommate (landlord's son) drank it without asking, assumed it was communal, and then, when informed of the mistake, refused to apologize or replace it. Instead, he escalated the situation, yelled, and used his position as the landlord's son to evict the author over a minor dispute. The author tried to resolve things and even apologized for their own emotional reaction, but the roommate continued to be unreasonable and punitive.

While the author could have put the wine away sooner, the primary fault lies with the roommate for not respecting others' property, refusing to apologize, and abusing his power as the landlord's son. The author's actions do not justify eviction or the roommate's behavior. Therefore, the other person is at fault.",stop,1089,195,1284

Final Answer: Everybody

Explanation:  
Both parties have reasonable perspectives, but both also contributed to the conflict:

- The author and their wife, as homeowners, have a legitimate desire for privacy, especially given their long-distance situation. However, asking a paying tenant (even a friend at a discount) to vacate their home, even temporarily, is a significant imposition and not standard landlord-tenant practice. This request, while understandable emotionally, is not typically considered reasonable from a tenant’s rights perspective.
- J, the friend/tenant, is justified in feeling put out by being asked to leave his home, even for a short period. However, his reaction—fury, hostility, and refusing to communicate—escalated the situation rather than seeking a compromise or expressing his discomfort earlier.
- Both sides failed to communicate clearly and empathetically: the author did not clarify the request or check in about J’s feelings, and J did not voice his discomfort until after the fact, letting resentment build.

Therefore, both the author and J share responsibility for the breakdown in communication and the resulting conflict.",stop,1250,228,1478

Explanation:  
The primary fault lies with the owner of the boxer dogs, whose negligence in securing the gate allowed their dogs to escape and attack. The author’s reaction—yelling at the owner—was a heated but understandable response to a stressful and dangerous situation.

**Reasoning:**  
Both parties share some responsibility here. The author did not provide a clear enough description or a picture of the desired haircut, especially since they were seeing a new stylist for the first time and did not know the technical details of their usual cut. On the other hand, the stylist should have clarified and confirmed the instructions—especially when the customer mentioned wanting to look good for an interview and specified different lengths for the sides and top. A professional stylist, particularly at a higher-end barbershop, is generally expected to double-check before making a major cut, especially with a new client.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
The author is asking if they would be the ""bad guy"" (WIBTA = Would I Be The Asshole) for staying in a relationship primarily for financial benefit, despite being unhappy with the sexual aspect. The partner has been honest and open about her trauma and sexual boundaries, and the author has chosen to stay, enjoying other aspects of the relationship. If the author stays solely for financial gain, while being unhappy and possibly resentful about the lack of sex, that would be unfair to the partner, who is acting in good faith. The ethical issue lies with the author’s motivation and potential lack of honesty, not with the partner. Therefore, the author would be at fault.",stop,389,153,542

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault because they are aware of Lyra's deception (lying about age, race, and identity) and the potential legal and ethical risks to their friend group, but are choosing not to inform the others. By withholding this critical information, the author is enabling a situation where their friends could unknowingly engage in inappropriate or illegal interactions with a minor, especially given the context of adult roleplay and content. While Lyra is also at fault for her deception, the question specifically asks about the author's responsibility in the current situation, and the author is now complicit by not disclosing the truth to protect others.",stop,654,142,796

You (the author) are at fault in this situation. M explicitly asked you to keep her suspicions and messages confidential, and you agreed to do so.

While your loyalty to your friend is understandable, you made a clear promise to M and then broke it, which is a breach of trust and integrity. The better course of action would have been to either not promise confidentiality in the first place or to remain neutral and not get involved.

- EBF, on the other hand, did not communicate her need for space clearly to the author and instead made a public post about being blocked, which could be seen as attention-seeking or escalating the situation.
- Both parties failed to communicate openly and directly, leading to misunderstandings and hurt feelings.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation: The author escalated a situation that was likely caused by rudeness or sarcasm from the employee into a serious accusation about the employee's mental health, which could have significant consequences for the employee. Instead of reporting the rudeness directly, the author chose to suggest a possible mental disability, which is a disproportionate and potentially harmful response. This could be seen as passive-aggressive and unnecessarily punitive, rather than simply addressing the actual issue (poor customer service). Therefore, the author is at fault.",stop,679,115,794

**Reasoning:**  
The author is primarily at fault here. They acknowledge that they are using someone who is emotionally unstable as a ""physical backup"" out of boredom, loneliness, or pity, despite knowing this is wrong. The author also admits to not treating the other person with respect and recognizes that their actions are ""shitty."" While the other person may have issues and is persistently contacting the author, the author is responsible for their own choices and for continuing to engage in a relationship that is unhealthy for both parties.

Explanation: The author is expressing a personal preference for a partner with healthy habits, motivated by their own struggles and goals.

**Reasoning:**  
The author is not at fault for being concerned about their friend's catfishing behavior and for expressing their feelings about it. The friend is at fault for catfishing and being dismissive about the harm it causes. However, the author also admits to being rude, blowing off plans, and sending a ""shitty"" text, which is not ideal behavior in a friendship.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, nobody is strictly ""at fault."" The author has a right to choose not to participate in the family business, especially if they have made their position clear from the beginning. The family, on the other hand, is not unreasonable for expecting some contribution from an adult child living at home rent-free, especially during a financially stressful time. The conflict arises from differing expectations and communication, not from clear wrongdoing by either party. Thus, ""Nobody"" is the most accurate answer.",stop,484,114,598

Explanation:  
Both you (the author) and your brother contributed to the escalation. You admit to repeatedly using vulgar language and ignoring his request to stop, which was disrespectful and provocative. Your brother, while initially tolerating it, eventually lost his temper, shouted, and damaged property, which is also inappropriate. Both parties had opportunities to de-escalate but did not.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, it appears to be a case of miscommunication and mismatched expectations rather than clear fault. The author (you) acted in good faith, believing the friendship was platonic and familial, while V harbored romantic feelings he did not disclose. When he confessed, you felt betrayed, but he also felt hurt by your reaction. Neither party acted with malicious intent; both were navigating complex emotions.

Based on the situation described, the primary issue is that C, the roommate, consistently makes a mess in the shared kitchen and does not clean up after himself, despite living with others who do their part in maintaining the apartment. The author and her boyfriend are cleaning up after C, and the boyfriend even tries to address the issue with C, but C does not change his behavior. The author is not at fault for wanting a clean living space or for being frustrated by C's lack of consideration. The boyfriend is making an effort to help, but the root cause of the problem is C's behavior. Therefore, C (the ""other"" in this context) is at fault.",stop,783,151,934

Final Answer: Everybody

**Reasoning:**  
- The teacher is at fault for yelling and being condescending, which is unprofessional and escalates the situation unnecessarily.
- The author is at fault for responding angrily and with disrespect (""I heard you the first time"" and the intent to insult), which is not an appropriate way to handle authority or conflict.
- The situation is a minor misunderstanding about procedure, but both parties contributed to the escalation and negativity.
- The teacher's dismissal method may be inefficient or unfair, but that does not justify disrespectful behavior from students.
- The author’s feelings about being bullied by others and wanting to ""deny him what he wants and probably insult him"" suggest a broader context of frustration, but in this specific incident, both the teacher and the author acted in ways that contributed to the conflict.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, nobody is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. The author is setting reasonable boundaries about the use of their car, especially since they are paying the majority of the costs and are being asked to do more than they are comfortable with. The boyfriend and his family are relying on the author, but there is no evidence of malicious intent—just a difference in expectations and boundaries. The boyfriend's family may be inconsiderate, but the core issue is a lack of communication and agreement about what is fair, not outright wrongdoing. Thus, ""Nobody"" is the most accurate answer, as this is a situation of conflicting needs and boundaries rather than clear fault.",stop,680,154,834

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Based on your description, the primary source of conflict and toxicity comes from your friend’s friend, who:
- Complained openly and repeatedly about you getting the weapon, despite already having a gun.
- Made rude, passive-aggressive, and eventually outright offensive comments (including a racial slur).
- Continued to antagonize you after the match.

Your own actions (not healing him, leaving Discord, muting him) were reactive to his behavior and not inherently toxic or aggressive. You communicated your boundaries and removed yourself from a situation that was making you uncomfortable, which is reasonable.

Your friend also failed to mediate or support you, and instead minimized your feelings by calling your actions “rage” and siding with his friend, which is not supportive behavior.

Therefore, the fault lies primarily with your friend’s friend (for being toxic and offensive) and, to a lesser extent, your friend (for not supporting you and enabling the toxic behavior). You are not at fault for setting boundaries and removing yourself from a toxic situation.

**Summary:**  
You are not the one at fault here; the blame lies with your friend’s friend (and your friend for enabling him).",stop,658,251,909

You (the author) made an initial driving error by failing to check your blind spot and almost causing an accident, which you admitted and tried to apologize for. However, the other driver responded with dangerous and aggressive behavior (cutting you off, stopping in front of you, reversing toward you, and flipping you off). You then escalated the situation by cutting him off and blocking him from merging back into the proper lane.

This is a complex family situation involving mental illness, hoarding, financial dishonesty, emotional abandonment, and deep-seated resentment. While the author is clearly hurt and feels abandoned, the brothers have also experienced trauma and have chosen to cope in their own (arguably unhealthy or selfish) ways. The younger brother's financial actions are unethical, and the older brother's public airing of family issues is insensitive, but the author also expresses intense anger and cuts off communication, which contributes to the breakdown. The root cause (the father's illness) is not anyone's fault, but the way each family member has responded has contributed to the overall dysfunction. Thus, ""Everybody"" shares some responsibility for the current state of affairs.",stop,813,156,969

The friend did not credit the author or ask permission, but the image itself was not created by either of them—it was a screenshot of a YouTube thumbnail, which is public content. While the friend's behavior may be inconsiderate or annoying, there is no clear ethical or rule-breaking ""fault"" here, as neither party owned the original content, and sharing things found online is common in internet culture. The author is upset about social dynamics and credit, but no one has committed a serious wrongdoing. Thus, ""Nobody"" is at fault in a strict sense.",stop,609,170,779

Based on the situation described, the author (the person writing) endured two years of repeated, personal, and insulting questions from the other person. The author responded with patience and kindness for a long time, only finally responding with a blunt (if harsh) truth after being provoked repeatedly. While the author's final comment was direct and could be considered hurtful, it was a reaction to ongoing disrespect and provocation.

The primary fault lies with the other person, who consistently insulted and belittled the author, disregarding boundaries and kindness. The author’s response, while not gentle, was a reaction to sustained mistreatment rather than unprovoked cruelty.

The author is at fault. The advice given to the younger brother encourages manipulative, disrespectful, and potentially harmful behavior towards others, especially women. Telling someone to ""stop being nice,"" ""act like a douchebag,"" ""be aloof,"" and ""don't listen to girls' advice"" promotes toxic masculinity and objectification. The author dismisses the value of kindness, respect, and genuine friendship, and encourages using people for sex without regard for their feelings.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author is considering going public with information about a serious crime (repeated sexual assault and rape) committed by a local media celebrity, after already gathering evidence and ensuring the perpetrator was fired. The author is also taking care to protect the victim's identity. The company is not actively covering up the crime but is not addressing it publicly either.

The author is not at fault for wanting to expose the truth about a serious crime, especially when taking steps to protect the victim. The company is not actively complicit, just silent. The perpetrator is clearly at fault for the crime, but the question is about whether the author is ""the asshole"" for considering public disclosure.

The author states they would have adjusted their behavior if they had known it was a problem, and when asked to be quiet in the past, they complied immediately. The lack of direct communication from the roommate is the primary reason the issue persisted.

Final Answer: Info

**Reasoning:**  
This situation involves interpersonal conflict, miscommunication, and differing expectations about chores and communication style. While the author seems to be following the agreed-upon chore chart and is rarely home, H appears to have higher standards and may not be applying them equally to herself. The author’s message could be interpreted as defensive but also attempts to clarify and resolve tension. H’s response seems to escalate the situation, but it’s not clear if this is due to ongoing issues or just this exchange.

There is not enough objective information to definitively assign fault to one party. The conflict seems to stem from miscommunication, differing expectations, and possibly pre-existing tension among all roommates. More context about the roommates’ perspectives and the overall dynamic would be needed to fairly assign blame.

**Summary:**  
- The author followed the chart and communicated their feelings.
- H may be inconsistent in her standards and took offense at the author’s response.
- The situation is complex and lacks enough detail to assign clear fault.

This is a highly emotional and complex situation involving infidelity, mental health crisis, and emergency intervention. Based on the information provided, nobody is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral or legal sense:

- The author acted out of concern for their partner's safety by calling the police when she was in crisis and potentially self-harming.
- The partner was in distress and made a dangerous choice, but mental health crises are not a matter of ""fault.""
- The friend participated in behavior that hurt the author, but the main issue at hand is the emergency response.

The author did what most people would consider the responsible thing in a crisis: seeking help for someone at risk of self-harm. There is no clear wrongdoing that would make any party solely or collectively ""at fault"" in this context.",stop,441,172,613

Final Answer: Everybody

Explanation:  
The situation involves a startup firing its CTO just before his 1-year vesting cliff, thereby denying him any equity for 10 months of work. The decision was influenced by outside investors wanting a more qualified CTO and the leadership team (CEO, CVO, COO/author) agreeing to let him go before the cliff.

**Fault Analysis:**
- The **author** (COO) participated in the decision and delivered the news, but was not the sole decision-maker.
- The **CEO and CVO** also agreed to the firing, making it a collective leadership decision.
- The **investors** influenced the decision by pressuring for a more qualified CTO, but did not directly fire the CTO.
- The **CTO** does not appear to have done anything wrong except perhaps not meeting the (possibly shifting) expectations of the company or investors.

**Why ""Everybody"":**  
The leadership team (including the author) is at fault for acting opportunistically and firing the CTO just before his cliff, which, while legal, is widely considered unethical in startup culture. The investors are also at fault for pressuring the company to make such a move for their own benefit. The CTO is not at fault.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is ""Everybody"" (among the decision-makers and influencers), as the responsibility is shared by the leadership team and the investors.",stop,589,291,880

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation, the main issue is that the girlfriend (GF) withheld important information about the nature of the trip (the presence of heavy drinkers), which is especially significant given the author's struggle with alcoholism. She also made plans that would require the author to take time off work without prior discussion, potentially causing him financial hardship. The author communicated his discomfort and boundaries, and the GF responded by calling him dramatic and expecting him to accommodate her plans regardless of his situation.

The father’s original comment was prejudiced, but it was made in a private family context and not directed at T. The author made the decision to relay this story to T, potentially putting T in an uncomfortable position and risking the professional relationship between T and the father.

Based on the situation described, the author (you) intentionally acted in a way to annoy your girlfriend so that she would break up with you, rather than communicating directly and honestly about wanting to end the relationship. While your girlfriend may have had her own faults and questionable behavior, the specific question is about whether you were at fault for how you handled the breakup.

Manipulating someone into breaking up with you, instead of having a direct conversation, is generally considered an unhealthy and unfair way to end a relationship. It avoids responsibility and can be emotionally hurtful to the other person. There were better choices available, such as being honest and ending the relationship directly.

Explanation:  
The author is at fault here. While it's understandable to feel vulnerable when sharing intimate photos, the author's reaction to his girlfriend's response was immature and retaliatory. Instead of communicating openly about feeling hurt by her ""LOL"" response, he chose to mirror her behavior in a passive-aggressive way (""next time u try to b sexy I’ll just say lol"" and then actually doing so). This escalated the situation rather than resolving it.

Additionally, the girlfriend's response (""LOL"") may have been awkward or uncertain, but she did not insult or demean the author. She later engaged by sending a racy pic herself, showing willingness to participate. The author's decision to respond with ""lol"" to her picture was intentionally dismissive and hurtful, as he admitted it was in retaliation.

Healthy communication would involve expressing feelings directly and seeking understanding, not mirroring perceived slights. Therefore, the author is primarily at fault for how he handled the situation.",stop,437,206,643

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
This situation is primarily about boundaries and preferences rather than clear-cut fault. The author is messy in their own private space, which is their right, especially since they have the room to themselves. G, as a guest, is entitled to her feelings about the mess, but she is not obligated to be there and does not have authority over the author's living habits. The author is not forcing G to be in the room, and G is not wrong for expressing discomfort, but repeatedly nagging about someone else's private space crosses a boundary.

Explanation:  
Based on the information provided, the father’s behavior is emotionally abusive and grossly disproportionate to the mistakes described (e.g., not asking for help, not putting in enough effort, stealing some money). Telling a child to kill themselves, repeatedly insulting them, and blaming them for family problems is never justified, regardless of the child’s academic performance or minor misbehavior. The mother’s response—telling you to feel guilty for your father’s words and to look past it—also enables this abuse.

While you acknowledge some wrongdoing (stealing money, not putting in full effort), these actions do not justify the extreme and harmful responses from your parents. The fault here lies with the parents, particularly the father, for their abusive and harmful behavior. You are not at fault for their actions.

The friends, while perhaps insensitive in their teasing, do not appear to be acting with malice, and the author acknowledges they don't mean to offend.

Explanation:  
You are not at fault (""the asshole"") for wanting to set boundaries with your friend and not be dragged into her ongoing crises. It is reasonable and healthy to protect your own mental health, especially after years of emotional labor and support that have not led to positive change. Your friend is struggling with serious mental health and addiction issues, and while her actions are harmful and chaotic, they are rooted in illness and trauma. However, you are not responsible for fixing her life or enduring ongoing distress because of her choices. Wanting to remain friends but not be involved in the chaos is a valid and compassionate boundary.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the author received incorrect advice from a grocery store employee about storing live lobsters. The author then called the store to suggest better training, being careful not to criticize the employee personally. The manager offered a refund policy. The author's family thinks the author is a jerk for potentially jeopardizing the employee's job.

However, the author acted reasonably: they sought clarification, were respectful, and focused on improving service rather than blaming the individual. The employee made a mistake but was not malicious, and the manager handled the complaint professionally. There is no clear evidence that anyone acted with ill intent or gross negligence. The author did not demand punitive action, and the employee's job is not necessarily at risk from a single, respectfully-phrased complaint.

Final Answer: Everybody

**Reasoning:**  
This is a complex social situation with multiple people making mistakes and contributing to the fallout:

- **Author:** The author admits to sending a ""nasty message"" and calling the other woman a ""homewrecking sl\*t,"" which is clearly inappropriate and hurtful, regardless of the circumstances. The author also acknowledges being less emotionally expressive, which contributed to relationship issues, but that in itself is not a fault—just a compatibility issue.
- **Ex-boyfriend:** He did not set boundaries with the other woman when she was flirting, despite knowing it made the author uncomfortable. He also spent more time with the other woman while complaining about not spending enough time with the author, which is hypocritical and contributed to the relationship breakdown.
- **Other woman (now-girlfriend):** She flirted with the author’s boyfriend, tried to drive a wedge between them, and said things like ""you're just being with her because it's easy,"" which is manipulative and inappropriate.
- **Guild leader:** The guild leader is trying to keep the peace, but by making the author’s return contingent on the ex and his girlfriend, it puts all the responsibility on the author, which is arguably unfair given the shared responsibility for the drama.

**Summary:**  
Everyone involved made mistakes and contributed to the situation. The author is not the sole villain, but also not blameless. The ex and his now-girlfriend also acted in ways that were hurtful and contributed to the fallout. The guild leader’s decision, while understandable, is not entirely fair either.

**Therefore, the most accurate answer is:**

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a way that would warrant blame:

- The author (you) politely declined to contribute to a group gift due to financial constraints and personal reasons. This is reasonable and you communicated your situation honestly.
- Natalie may be acting immaturely and is clearly upset, but her reaction (removing people from the group chat, ignoring you) is more about her own feelings than any actual wrongdoing on your part. While her behavior is not ideal, it's not so egregious as to make her solely ""at fault"" in a moral sense for this specific incident.
- Mike also declined, and his reason is personal, but again, declining to participate in a group gift is not inherently wrong.
- The rest of the group is not described as having done anything wrong.

While Natalie’s overall behavior on the trip and her reaction to the gift situation are not great, the specific question is about whether you (the author) are at fault for not contributing to the gift and the resulting tension. In this context, nobody is truly at fault—people are just having a normal, if awkward, social disagreement.",stop,790,250,1040

Explanation:  
In this situation, you (the author) are setting a personal boundary by choosing not to meet or discuss your friend's partner due to your moral objections to his behavior (cheating on his wife). You are not preventing your friend from seeing him or dictating her choices; you are simply choosing not to participate in that aspect of her life. Your friend is upset because she wants you to be supportive and include her partner, but you are not obligated to do so if it makes you uncomfortable.

Neither party is objectively ""at fault"" here—your friend is free to make her choices, and you are free to set your boundaries.

The friend (AIQ) was described as rude, snappy, and inconsiderate, but the author’s response was simply to distance themselves and stop talking to her. There is no indication of any escalation, confrontation, or wrongdoing on the author’s part—just a withdrawal from a negative relationship. The friend’s behavior was unpleasant, but not egregiously harmful, and the author’s response was reasonable self-protection. Therefore, in this context, nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense; it’s a case of personalities clashing and a friendship dissolving as a result.",stop,1114,176,1290

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the author is primarily at fault. While it is understandable to feel uncomfortable with one's partner flirting with friends, the author appears to be applying a double standard: she is okay with her male friends flirting with her (because they've been friends for years), but not okay with her boyfriend engaging in similar behavior with her friends, even though he is not the main instigator. Additionally, instead of addressing the group dynamic or discussing boundaries with both her boyfriend and friends, she unilaterally decided to exclude her boyfriend from future events, which led to the group perceiving her as unfair. This suggests that the author is at fault for not handling the situation more equitably and for imposing inconsistent standards.",stop,486,159,645

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
This is a complex relationship conflict rooted in deeply held beliefs and values about child health and safety. The author is not at fault for holding a firm boundary about vaccinating future children, especially given their healthcare background and prior communication of this stance. The fiancée is also acting according to her beliefs, even if those beliefs are not supported by scientific consensus. Both parties communicated their positions early on, and the disagreement is fundamental and value-based, not due to malice or clear wrongdoing.

The author is not being manipulative or abusive by stating a non-negotiable boundary about their children's health, especially since this was discussed at the start of the relationship. The fiancée is not at fault for having her own beliefs, even if they are misinformed. The conflict arises from incompatible values, not from anyone acting in bad faith or causing harm to the other.

Therefore, in this situation, **nobody is at fault**—it is a tragic incompatibility, not a case of wrongdoing.",stop,733,216,949

Final Answer: Other

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author is not at fault for their feelings or for choosing not to continue a romantic relationship after learning important information that affects their attraction and compatibility. The author was honest about their preferences and did not act maliciously. The other person (the friend/romantic interest) withheld significant information about themselves that is highly relevant in a romantic and sexual context, especially as the relationship became more intimate. While it is understandable that coming out as trans can be difficult and fraught with fear of rejection, it is also important to be honest with a romantic partner before things become sexual, especially if there is a possibility that this information could be a dealbreaker for the other person.

The friend's reaction—calling the author evil, manipulative, and claiming to have faked the friendship—was unfair and hurtful. While both parties are dealing with difficult emotions, the author did not act with malice or deception. Therefore, the primary fault lies with the other person for not disclosing important information and for reacting with hostility when the author set a boundary.",stop,705,229,934

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, you are reflecting on your feelings and judgments about your family's behavior at your grandmother's funeral. While you are questioning whether you are an ""asshole"" for judging your family, it is natural to have complex emotions and judgments in situations involving grief, regret, and family dynamics. Grief can manifest in many ways, and people may cry for reasons beyond direct closeness—such as guilt, regret, or the finality of loss. Similarly, not crying does not mean you cared less.

No one is objectively ""at fault"" here; everyone is processing the situation in their own way. Your feelings and judgments are understandable, but they do not make you an ""asshole,"" nor does your family's emotional display make them at fault. This is a nuanced, emotionally charged situation with no clear wrongdoing.",stop,699,180,879

Explanation:  
You acted out of concern for the children's safety, which is a responsible and caring thing to do, especially given the context of loud noises, screaming, and children running out crying. You also had reason to believe that a direct confrontation could escalate the situation or create neighborly conflict, especially since the relationship was already strained. While the report turned out to be unfounded, your intentions were to protect vulnerable children, not to cause harm or distress to the mother. Therefore, in this situation, nobody is truly at fault—your actions were reasonable given the information you had, and the mother, while upset, was not actually harmed by the report.",stop,522,144,666

The author is not at fault for considering escalating the issue, as the smell is affecting the work environment, customers, and business.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
The author is at fault in this situation. While breakups are always difficult, the author chose to break up with their partner in a very public, high-stakes setting (a difficult-to-reserve, five-star restaurant), which is generally considered inconsiderate and likely to cause embarrassment or distress. The author also expresses a lack of empathy for their partner’s feelings, refers to her behavior in derogatory terms, and seems more concerned about their own reputation and inconvenience than the emotional impact on their partner. Additionally, the author rebuffed her attempts at affection and expedited the breakup due to personal annoyance, rather than considering a more private or compassionate approach. While the ex’s public reaction may have been dramatic, it was provoked by the author’s actions. Therefore, the author is primarily at fault.",stop,576,175,751

The co-worker is not at fault for asking, as people are allowed to make requests, though it may be inappropriate to expect a positive response. The author did not act rudely or unprofessionally. The later revelation that the co-worker was not actually going to India and was asking multiple people for money suggests possible dishonesty on the co-worker's part, but the question is about the initial refusal to lend money, not the co-worker's later actions.

Explanation: Based on the situation, the main issue is that your girlfriend is repeatedly volunteering you for tasks without your consent, especially during a period when you are already overworked and have limited personal time. While helping her mother is kind, it is not reasonable for your girlfriend to continually obligate you without considering your needs or boundaries, especially after you have communicated your feelings. The mother is not at fault, as she is not the one making these arrangements. You are not at fault for wanting to protect your limited free time and set boundaries. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with your girlfriend for not respecting your boundaries and for guilt-tripping you when you expressed your concerns.",stop,527,146,673

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Outing someone as LGBTQ+ without their consent is widely considered a serious violation of their privacy and autonomy, regardless of the circumstances. While your brother's behavior toward you has been hurtful and bullying, and your feelings of anger and desire to defend yourself are understandable, the act of outing him—especially in front of family members who may not be supportive—puts him at risk and takes away his agency over a deeply personal aspect of his life. This action is generally seen as crossing a line, even if it was done in the heat of the moment and after years of provocation.

Your brother is responsible for his own actions and the pain he has caused you, but in this specific situation, the act of outing him is the central issue being evaluated for fault. Therefore, the author (you) is at fault for outing your brother, even if the situation is complex and emotionally charged.",stop,1441,193,1634

Final Answer: Author

---

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the author (you) have been a supportive friend to D for a long time, often putting D's needs above your own, even when you were struggling. However, the specific question is about whether you were at fault (""AITA"") for snapping at D and telling her to ""fuck off"" when she called you selfish for not wanting to listen to her relationship problems while you were in a depressive state.

While D has certainly been self-absorbed and not reciprocated your support, the act of snapping and telling her to ""fuck off"" is an escalation and a hurtful way to communicate, even if your feelings are valid. Healthy boundaries are important, but expressing them with hostility or insults is generally considered to be at fault in interpersonal conflicts.

Therefore, while D is not blameless, the specific action in question (telling her to ""fuck off"") makes the author at fault in this instance. A more constructive approach would have been to calmly explain your boundaries and emotional state.

If the question were about the overall relationship dynamic, ""Everybody"" might be appropriate, but for the specific action, the author is at fault.",stop,1706,252,1958

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, you are not at fault for prioritizing your mental health and well-being, especially given your history of mental illness and sleep issues. Your mother’s feelings are understandable, but her emotional response and guilt-tripping are not your responsibility to manage at the expense of your health. You made a reasonable effort to keep your promise, but it is not sustainable for you. No one is acting with malicious intent; this is a difficult situation rooted in emotional needs and personal limitations. Therefore, nobody is truly ""at fault"" here.",stop,507,124,631

Explanation: The situation describes a supervisor who misrepresented the seriousness of incident reports to the author, telling them it was ""no big deal"" and to just sign them, only for upper management to later use those reports as grounds for possible termination. The author acted in good faith based on their supervisor's guidance.

Final Answer: Author

Reasoning: Based on the information provided, the author explicitly stated that he broke up with his girlfriend because she lied to him about her past with his friends, after previously warning her that lying again would end the relationship. While both parties have a history of being with people in the same social circle, the breakup was triggered by the girlfriend's dishonesty, not her past actions. However, the author also has a similar past and seems to hold a double standard, but the direct cause for the breakup was the breach of trust after a clear boundary was set.

Explanation:  
This is a deeply complex and emotionally charged situation involving addiction, mental illness, and the limits of personal responsibility and support. The author is struggling with compassion fatigue and has set boundaries after repeated attempts to help their friend, who is dealing with both substance abuse and schizophrenia. The friend is making harmful choices, but her capacity for self-care is compromised by her mental health and addiction. The author is not at fault for setting boundaries to protect themselves and their daughter, especially after past threats and unsafe behavior. The friend is not fully at fault either, given her mental health challenges and addiction. This is a tragic situation where nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a moral sense—it's a result of illness, addiction, and the limits of what one person can do for another.

Explanation:  
The author is considering a manipulative tactic—pretending to take up smoking—to emotionally coerce their mother into quitting. While the motivation comes from love and concern, the method is manipulative and could cause unnecessary distress or guilt.

The author is at fault for violating their mother's privacy by going through her phone, search history, and deleted photos without consent, and for confronting the family friend before discussing the matter with their mother.

Final Answer: Info

This situation is extremely complex, involving trauma, abuse, mental health struggles, and difficult relationship dynamics. While the author acknowledges some actions that may be considered wrong (engaging with an abusive ex, not being fully transparent with their current partner), these actions are deeply influenced by past abuse, trauma responses, and a lack of available support. The ex (T) is clearly at fault for his abusive behavior, but the author’s actions are not simply a matter of “fault” in a moral sense—they are coping mechanisms in a very difficult situation. The current boyfriend (A) may have been unsupportive, but again, the full context of his knowledge and emotional state is not clear.

Given the complexity and the need for more context about each person’s understanding, intentions, and the impact of trauma, it is not possible to assign clear fault to one party. More information and nuance are needed to make a fair judgment.",stop,861,197,1058

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the author went to see a movie (IT) with their girlfriend despite not liking horror films, because she wanted to see it and asked repeatedly. When the author wanted their girlfriend to accompany them to a movie (DBZ Broly) that she wasn't interested in, she refused, justifying it by saying the author had said IT was ""okay,"" so she didn't have to reciprocate.

The frustration is about a perceived double standard: the author did something for their girlfriend that she wouldn't do in return. The author is not at fault for feeling annoyed at this lack of reciprocity; rather, the girlfriend is at fault for not being willing to do for the author what he did for her, especially after he explained his feelings.

Mark's reaction—making a rude comment and then trying to start a physical fight at practice—is disproportionate and inappropriate.

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, **nobody is at fault** for the desire to reach out. The author acknowledges their past mistakes, has taken responsibility, made amends, and is considering whether reaching out would be wrong. The ex is not at fault for leaving, as she did what was best for her well-being. The author is not at fault for wanting to reconnect, as long as he is respectful of her boundaries and prepared for any response. The question is about whether reaching out would make him an ""asshole"" (WIBTA), and simply wanting to reach out—especially after genuine change and restitution—is not inherently wrong.

Based on the situation described, this is a complex breakup involving emotional struggles, communication issues, and personal growth. While both parties made mistakes—her with manipulative comments and emotional dependence, and you with not communicating your feelings sooner—neither side is solely or clearly ""at fault"" in a way that warrants blame. These are common, if painful, dynamics in young relationships, especially under stress. Both of you were navigating difficult emotions and transitions.

Based on the situation described, the author (you) is not at fault for breaking up with your boyfriend. The boyfriend repeatedly ignored your boundaries regarding physical contact, was excessively clingy and controlling with texting, and expressed views supporting child abuse. These are significant issues that justify ending a relationship. Your friends' opinion that ""one incident"" shouldn't have ended the relationship overlooks the pattern of disrespect for your boundaries and the seriousness of his views on abuse.

Based on the situation described, it appears to be a case of misaligned expectations and stress rather than clear fault.

You did your best to help, but also wanted to respect your parents' wishes.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the author is a young adult (18, almost 19) who has been living in a highly controlling, emotionally abusive, and potentially unsafe home environment. The author’s father has made threats of violence, and the mother, while more passive, has not been able to protect the author or set boundaries with the father. The author left home for their own safety and mental health, communicated their intentions, and did not disappear without a trace.

The family’s reaction—tracking the author, threatening to call the police, and spreading panic—stems from their own inability to respect the author’s autonomy and their history of controlling behavior. While it is understandable that the family is worried, their actions are disproportionate and rooted in the same patterns of control and emotional manipulation that caused the author to leave in the first place.

The author is not at fault for prioritizing their safety and mental health, especially after repeated threats and a lack of support at home. The family, particularly the parents, are at fault for creating an environment that made the author feel unsafe and for responding to the author’s reasonable actions with further control and guilt-tripping.

**Summary:**  
The author is not an ""asshole"" for leaving or for the resulting stress; the fault lies with the parents (and, to a lesser extent, the family system) for their abusive and controlling behavior.",stop,1404,296,1700

This situation is complex and involves multiple people, pets, and constraints.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author is primarily at fault for the way he treated his ex. Here’s why:

- **Emotional Stringing Along:** After a 6-year relationship, the author broke up and immediately started dating someone else, but continued to provide emotional support to his ex, knowing she was still attached and struggling. This can be seen as giving false hope or not allowing her to move on.
- **Lack of Boundaries:** He maintained intimate, emotionally charged conversations with his ex while in a new relationship, which is unfair to both women.
- **Abrupt Cutoff:** When his new girlfriend demanded he cut off his ex, he did so suddenly and harshly, right before his ex’s birthday, despite knowing she was emotionally fragile. This was unnecessarily cruel and could have been handled with more empathy and gradual boundaries.
- **Failure to Take Responsibility:** The author seems to deflect blame onto his new girlfriend for her actions, but he is the common denominator and the one who failed to set clear, healthy boundaries from the start.

While the new girlfriend’s actions (e.g., posting to hurt the ex, reading messages) are not ideal, the author’s choices set the stage for the entire situation and directly caused the ex’s distress. The ex’s and new girlfriend’s actions are reactions to the author’s poor handling of the situation.

They repeatedly insulted and belittled you, both in the past (regarding your injury, job, and appearance) and during the recent visit (with persistent, explicit, and homophobic jokes).

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
Based on the situation described, the author is at fault. The woman explicitly said she did not want to have sex, and although she later participated, the initial ""no"" should have been respected without further pressure or escalation. The author continued to make out and proceeded further after her refusal, which can be seen as disregarding her boundaries. Even if she did not physically resist or verbally object again, the prior clear communication of her wishes should have been the end of any sexual advances. The regret and discomfort she expressed afterward further indicate that her consent was not fully enthusiastic or freely given. Therefore, the responsibility lies with the author for not respecting her initial boundary.",stop,487,147,634

While it may have been considerate to discuss such a large purchase with her out of respect for the relationship, you were not obligated to do so given your current financial arrangement.

Final Answer: Nobody

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, the conflict arose from a combination of misunderstandings, emotional reactions, and pre-existing issues in the relationship. The author felt hurt by discovering her boyfriend was talking to another girl after he had said he wasn't, which led to her confronting him. The boyfriend reacted poorly by snatching the phone and accidentally hitting her, which escalated the situation. The author then left the restaurant, and the boyfriend didn't get to eat.

However, the boyfriend is an adult and could have chosen to eat at the restaurant after the author left, or get food elsewhere. The author was reacting to being hurt and embarrassed, and it's understandable she didn't want to stay. The boyfriend's lack of food at home is not the author's responsibility, especially given the circumstances.

Therefore, while there were mistakes and emotional reactions on both sides, neither party is solely at fault for the boyfriend going to bed hungry. The situation is unfortunate, but nobody is truly at fault for the specific issue of him not eating.",stop,607,214,821

Final Answer: Everybody

Explanation:  
Both parties share responsibility for the conflict. The author was transparent about her actions and tried to draw a parallel between her behavior and her boyfriend's, but adding someone on Snapchat (a more personal platform) could be seen as crossing a boundary in some relationships, especially if not discussed beforehand. The boyfriend, on the other hand, reacted with disproportionate anger, accusations, and threats, which is not a healthy way to address concerns in a relationship. Additionally, the argument about buying a car introduces financial expectations that may not be reasonable or fair, especially given the boyfriend's current situation abroad.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
While everyone involved is an adult and can technically make their own choices, the author knowingly entered into a relationship with a close friend's mother, fully aware of the likely emotional impact on the friend and the social consequences. Even though the author was honest and upfront, pursuing the relationship despite the friend's clear discomfort and request to stop shows a disregard for the friend's feelings and the boundaries of their friendship. The mother also shares responsibility, but the question is about whether the author is at fault (""AITA""), and in this context, the author is primarily at fault for prioritizing their own desires over the well-being of their friend and social group.",stop,438,141,579

Explanation:  
The primary issue here is that the mother made a unilateral decision to replace the bed, despite the author's clear and repeated objections.

The author did not destroy the air mattress, only deflated it after trying to make it work and finding it impossible to sleep on. The mother, while well-intentioned, imposed her own preferences and did not respect the author's autonomy or comfort. Therefore, the mother is primarily at fault in this situation.",stop,819,126,945

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the primary conflict arose because the ex-boyfriend (the 5-year-old's father) refused to let a hungry child eat lunch as a punishment for not finishing breakfast, which is unreasonable and potentially harmful. The author (19F) intervened to ensure the child was fed, which is a responsible and caring action. While the argument escalated and both parties exchanged harsh words, the root cause was the ex-boyfriend's inappropriate handling of the child's needs. The author’s reaction, though snarky, was provoked by the ex-boyfriend’s unreasonable stance and concern for her sister’s well-being. Therefore, the ex-boyfriend is primarily at fault in this situation.",stop,729,159,888

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault in this situation. While the family has a tradition of social drinking and the author’s intentions may not have been malicious, the key issue is that the author knowingly gave alcohol to a minor (her nephew, age 17) without his parents’ permission, directly undermining the explicit rules and boundaries set by his father (the author’s brother). The author also acknowledges this was poor judgment and has apologized, which shows awareness of the mistake.

Regardless of family tradition or the author’s own upbringing, the responsibility for setting rules for a minor lies with the parents. The author’s actions disregarded the brother’s parenting choices and legal boundaries, which is a significant breach of trust. The brother’s reaction, while perhaps emotionally charged and possibly disproportionate in duration, is understandable given the circumstances.

Therefore, the author is at fault for crossing a clear boundary and enabling underage drinking against the wishes of the minor’s parent.",stop,1217,205,1422

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Based on your description, your friend is at fault here. While it’s understandable that your friend’s own traumatic experiences with strict parents may have colored his perspective, he overstepped by making harsh judgments, projecting his own issues, and refusing to listen to your side. He also continued to criticize you after you tried to de-escalate and move the conversation to a more productive format (a call instead of texts). You did not ask for his opinion, and he does not have enough context about your family dynamic to make such strong accusations. Furthermore, his behavior during the call—yelling, not letting you speak, and making hurtful comments—was inappropriate and disrespectful.

You, on the other hand, appear to be acting in good faith, trying to do what’s best for your stepson and maintain a healthy relationship. Wanting your stepson to start homework on Friday evenings is a reasonable parenting decision and not remotely abusive.

Therefore, your friend is at fault for escalating the situation, making unfair accusations, and not respecting boundaries.",stop,735,227,962

Explanation:  
Based on the situation, you (the author) are not at fault for choosing not to attend a work party that is far away and instead having a small gathering with colleagues who also didn't want to make the trip. You did not organize a competing event to undermine your boss, but rather provided an alternative for those who were unable or unwilling to attend the main party for valid reasons (distance, family, comfort).

Explanation: The author is considering intentionally killing someone else's property (the plant) through deception, which is unethical regardless of the owner's negligence. While the friend is certainly at fault for endangering her cat by keeping a toxic plant accessible, the author would be at fault for taking matters into their own hands in a dishonest and destructive way. The correct course would be to continue to warn the friend, refuse to care for the cat under these conditions, or contact animal welfare if the cat is being seriously harmed—not to destroy property and lie about it.",stop,412,121,533

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, nobody is at fault. You and your SO took responsible steps: you prepared for the puppy, consulted with the rescue and your vet, and tried to meet Koda’s needs. When it became clear that Koda’s separation anxiety was severe and affecting his health, you sought professional advice and repeatedly communicated with the rescue. Ultimately, you made the difficult decision to surrender him only after exhausting your options and with his best interests in mind, ensuring a suitable adopter was lined up.

There is no evidence of neglect, malice, or irresponsibility on your part. The rescue’s response may have been unsympathetic, but they are not directly at fault for the situation either. Sometimes, despite best intentions and efforts, a pet’s needs cannot be met in a particular home. Recognizing this and acting in the animal’s best interest is responsible and compassionate.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
The author is at fault here. While everyone is entitled to their own preferences, the way the author communicated their dissatisfaction was insensitive and hurtful. Making negative comments about a partner's body, especially in a way that makes them feel insecure or unattractive, is disrespectful and damaging to the relationship. The author’s approach lacked empathy and failed to consider the impact of their words on their girlfriend’s self-esteem and comfort.

While the author is clearly at fault for cheating and for not being honest with his wife or the woman he is cheating with, the wife is also at fault for her own infidelities (sleeping with the author's brother, conceiving a child with him, and not being honest about it).

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
The husband is at fault here. The school has set clear immunization requirements for clinicals, and falsifying dates on a medical form is unethical and potentially dangerous. The author is correct in insisting that the requirements be met as stated, and that if there is a disagreement, it should be addressed with the school, not by making up information. The husband’s willingness to falsify records and his resistance to following the stated requirements is the core issue. The author is not at fault for insisting on honesty and compliance.",stop,593,120,713

The primary fault in this situation lies with the server, whose unprofessional and inappropriate behavior (flirting, asking personal questions, invading personal space, and providing poor service) was the catalyst for the negative experience. The author’s actions—leaving a negative review—were a reasonable response to the service received.

**Reasoning:**  
While there were some unforeseen circumstances (car trouble), the author made a series of choices that prioritized another party and the convenience of their other friends over arriving at their close friend's milestone birthday party on time. The author acknowledges that they could have left earlier and that they would be upset if the roles were reversed. The friend communicated that it was a low-key event and that late arrival was okay, but ultimately, the author missed the main event and the friend’s actual birthday moment. The lack of response from the friend and others suggests hurt feelings.

The roommate is also not at fault for declining and choosing to take the free bus instead. Both parties acted within reasonable boundaries: the author for wanting to offset costs, and the roommate for not wanting to pay and using an alternative.

Final Answer: Author

Explanation:  
The author is at fault here because, while it is understandable to have personal preferences, threatening to break up with a partner over their bodily autonomy—especially after expressing a desire for a long-term future together—is controlling and unfair. The girlfriend is not at fault for wanting to express herself through tattoos and piercings, as these are personal choices. The author can communicate their feelings and preferences, but issuing an ultimatum about ending the relationship if she goes through with her plans is not respectful of her autonomy. The healthy approach would be to have an honest conversation about feelings and compatibility, not to control or coerce her choices.",stop,562,140,702

Explanation: Based on the situation described, the brother is primarily at fault for his repeated aggressive, manipulative, and destructive behavior toward the family.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the information provided, the author is primarily at fault for the negative dynamics in this situation. Here’s why:

- **Flirting with her sister:** The author admits to repeatedly flirting with her sister, which both women found ""weird and creepy."" This behavior made her sister uncomfortable enough to avoid the author. This is a clear social misstep and boundary violation.
- **Interfering in her romantic decisions:** The author pressured her to reconsider rejecting his best friend, which is inappropriate and dismissive of her autonomy.
- **Joking style:** The author acknowledges that his jokes are not well-received and that she (and allegedly others) find them unpleasant. Continuing this behavior despite feedback is inconsiderate.
- **Confrontation:** The author confronted her publicly about laughing at his grandfather’s illness, which she denied. Even if her reaction was inappropriate, the public confrontation and the author’s decision to ""forgive"" her in front of others comes across as self-righteous and possibly humiliating for her.

While her alleged laughter at the author’s family tragedy (if true) would be wrong, the author’s pattern of disrespectful and boundary-crossing behavior is the root cause of the animosity. The author’s actions have repeatedly made her uncomfortable, and he has not taken responsibility for that.

Therefore, the author is at fault.",stop,655,289,944

**Reasoning:**  
Both parties have engaged in problematic behavior. The author is at fault for secretly recording private conversations, which is a violation of trust and privacy (and may be illegal depending on jurisdiction).
