Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**
- The author is expressing feelings and thoughts, not actions that directly harm anyone. Wanting someone gone (even wishing for their death) after a lifetime of abuse is a natural, if painful, emotional response, not a moral failing.
- The father is responsible for his past abuse, but in this specific situation (the choking incident), he is incapacitated and not at fault for the author's feelings.
- The mother is arguably neglectful in not addressing the father's dangerous condition, but the question is about the author's feelings, not the mother's actions.
- The author did not cause harm or act maliciously; they simply did not intervene during a medical emergency, which is morally complex given the history of abuse, but not clearly ""at fault"" in a way that fits the options.
- The situation is tragic and fraught, but in terms of ""fault"" for the author's feelings and reaction, nobody is at fault. The author is not a monster for feeling relief at the prospect of an abuser's death.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is ""Nobody.""",stop,795,230,1025

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Open Relationship Agreement:** Both you and your SO agreed to an open relationship, which means both parties are allowed to have sex with others. This was mutually decided to avoid feelings of lost opportunity and to address early stagnation/tension.

2. **Actions Taken:**  
   - You have had sex with others (including an ex) and did not disclose this to your SO.  
   - Your SO has also had sex with others (via Tinder) and did not disclose this to you.

3. **Communication:** There appears to be a lack of explicit communication about current sexual activity with others, but there is no indication that disclosure was a required part of your agreement.

4. **Feelings:** You feel hurt and jealous upon learning your SO had sex with someone else, especially since your attempts at intimacy have been unsuccessful. However, you recognize that you have also slept with others and did not disclose this.

5. **Fault Assessment:**  
   - Neither party has broken the open relationship agreement as described.  
   - Both parties are acting within the boundaries of the agreement, even if feelings of jealousy and hurt arise.  
   - The emotional response is understandable, but it does not make either party ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense, given the agreement.

6. **Conclusion:**  
   - There is no clear wrongdoing by either party based on the information provided.  
   - The situation calls for more communication and perhaps a renegotiation of boundaries, but no one is ""at fault"" for their actions as described.

**Summary:**  
You are not a ""stupid hypocrite."" Both you and your SO are acting within the terms of your open relationship, and your feelings are valid but do not indicate fault. The best next step is open, honest communication about your needs and feelings.",stop,592,387,979

Final Answer: Author

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Background:** The author had a brief relationship with a woman, who then chose to be exclusive with another man. The timeline of her pregnancy suggests the author could be the father, but she claims the child is her partner's.

2. **Actions:** The author, years later, sees the man and child, and, after some conversation, tells the man that he suspects he is the father, explaining the situation and his suspicions.

3. **Consequences:** The man is devastated, and the woman is angry, sending the author many messages accusing him of causing trouble.

4. **Fault Analysis:**
   - The woman may have been dishonest about the timeline and paternity, but the author had no proof and chose not to pursue a paternity test or direct conversation with her.
   - The author, instead of addressing the issue privately with the woman or seeking legal/medical confirmation, chose to reveal his suspicions directly to the man in a public setting, causing emotional harm and upheaval.
   - The man is a victim in this situation, as he was unaware of the possible paternity issue.

5. **Conclusion:** While the woman may have been dishonest, the author is at fault for how he handled the situation—specifically, for confronting the man directly and publicly with unconfirmed suspicions, rather than addressing the issue privately or through appropriate channels. This action was likely to cause distress and conflict, and was not the most responsible or considerate way to handle the situation.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is expressing a personal preference about not wanting children, which is a valid and individual choice.
- The boyfriend initially agreed with the author about not wanting kids, but his feelings seem to have changed over time, which is also normal as people can change their minds.
- There is no indication of anyone being dishonest or malicious; both parties are communicating their feelings.
- The author is not at fault for not wanting children, and the boyfriend is not at fault for possibly changing his mind.
- The situation is about differing life goals, not about wrongdoing or fault.

Final Answer: Everybody

Step by step reasoning:
- The teacher’s initial offer to help and give more time is appropriate, but the student’s perception of the teacher as “creepy” and “staring” is subjective and not clearly substantiated by evidence in the situation.
- The student threatens to report the teacher for alleged inappropriate behavior in order to get a better grade, which is manipulative and not appropriate.
- The teacher’s response—offering to raise the grade in exchange for not reporting—crosses a serious ethical line and is highly inappropriate, as it suggests a willingness to cover up or bribe to avoid consequences.
- Both parties engage in behavior that is problematic: the student for making a threat to get a better grade, and the teacher for offering to change a grade to avoid being reported.

- His rationale was that it would be a nice gesture, but it disregarded her expectations and the mutual agreement.
- When she reacted negatively, it was because he violated her trust and the terms they had set together.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author is an aspiring writer with some experience and realistic expectations about the publishing industry.
   - The author's friend, who is not a native English speaker and has basic English skills, is writing a novel in English and is very optimistic about her chances.
   - The author has been helping her friend with editing and feedback, but the friend is not receptive to criticism.
   - The friend received high praise from someone else and now has unrealistic expectations.
   - The author tried to give honest, practical advice about the publishing process and the importance of editing and language proficiency.
   - The friend reacted negatively, calling the author unsupportive.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The author gave honest, constructive feedback and tried to help the friend avoid disappointment.
   - The friend is perhaps naive or overly optimistic, but not malicious.
   - The disagreement is based on differing expectations and communication styles, not on any clear wrongdoing.
   - The author did not insult or belittle the friend, just gave a realistic perspective.
   - The friend is entitled to her dreams, but the author is also entitled to share honest advice.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - There is no clear ""fault"" here. The author was not cruel or dismissive, just realistic. The friend is sensitive and perhaps not ready for criticism, but that's not a moral failing.
   - This is a classic case of a well-meaning disagreement, not a situation where someone is clearly at fault.

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The person who was farting repeatedly in a public, enclosed space (the bar) was being inconsiderate to others around them. This is generally considered rude behavior.
- The author, while justified in being upset, chose to confront the person in a way that escalated the situation and caused a scene, which is also not ideal in a social setting.
- The bartender, as an employee responsible for the atmosphere of the bar, may have overreacted by publicly berating the author instead of handling the situation more diplomatically.
- All parties contributed to the escalation and unpleasantness of the situation: the farter for their behavior, the author for their confrontational response, and the bartender for their handling of the aftermath.

Step by step reasoning:
- The author is frustrated by a neighbor running an unlicensed auto repair business in a residential area, which is causing parking issues.
- The author is considering reporting the neighbor to authorities, but is concerned about the social and cultural implications, especially as a new resident in a gentrifying neighborhood.
- The neighbor may be violating zoning laws and possibly tax laws, but the author is not certain of the specifics.
- The author has not yet taken any action, only considered it and asked for advice.
- Fault would depend on whether the neighbor is actually violating laws, and whether the author’s potential action is justified or unnecessarily disruptive.
- There is not enough information to definitively assign fault: we don’t know the neighbor’s full situation, the exact local laws, or the impact of the business beyond parking.

Final Answer: Author

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Legal vs. Moral Responsibility:**  
   The author is correct that, legally, he is only required to pay the court-ordered child support and follow the custody arrangement. However, the situation involves more than just legal obligations; it involves the well-being of his child, who now has significant medical needs.

2. **Child’s Best Interest:**  
   The child is experiencing a serious medical condition (seizures, hospitalizations, specialist appointments). The mother is struggling financially and logistically to provide care, and is asking for help both financially and with time.

3. **Author’s Response:**  
   The author refuses to help beyond the minimum required by the court order, citing his own financial and scheduling constraints. He also refuses to participate in a medical trial that could potentially benefit his child, simply because it is inconvenient and he personally doubts its necessity.

4. **Assessment of Fault:**  
   While the author is not legally at fault, he is morally at fault for refusing to help his child and co-parent in a time of increased need. Parenting is not just about meeting the bare minimum legal requirements, especially when a child’s health and well-being are at stake. The mother is doing more than her share, and the author is abdicating his responsibilities as a parent.

5. **Other Parties:**  
   The mother is not at fault; she is seeking help for their child. The situation does not indicate fault on the part of any other individuals.

**Conclusion:**  
The author is at fault for failing to step up as a parent when his child’s needs increased, even if he is meeting the minimum legal requirements.",stop,656,352,1008

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The author is being asked to do a significant amount of work (multiple airport pickups/drop-offs at inconvenient hours, giving up his bed, disrupting his and his autistic sister's routine) for a trip he is not involved in.
2. The author offered reasonable alternatives (paying for Uber/Lyft) to avoid the disruption, which were rejected.
3. The girlfriend and her sister are making requests that are inconsiderate of the author's responsibilities (caring for his autistic sister) and comfort (sleeping arrangements).
4. The sister, in particular, seems ungrateful and demanding, based on the examples given.
5. The author is not refusing to help entirely, just setting boundaries and offering alternatives.

Therefore, the fault lies with the girlfriend and her sister for making unreasonable demands and not respecting the author's boundaries and responsibilities. The author is not at fault for arguing or pushing back.

**Reasoning:**
- The author accidentally damaged the friend's laptop previously, which understandably made the friend hesitant to lend it out again.
- The friend has reciprocated favors (buying food/drinks when able), so the relationship is not one-sided.
- The author pressured and guilt-tripped the friend for not lending the laptop, despite the friend's valid concerns.
- The author is now giving the friend the silent treatment over this, which is disproportionate and unfair.
- While the author has done many favors, that does not entitle them to override the friend's boundaries, especially after damaging the laptop before.

- Y responded with disproportionate physical aggression: pushing you, breaking your pen, and punching you (major escalation).
- You finally slapped Y in response to being punched (retaliation).

Everyone involved contributed to the escalation of the situation:
- X started with a prank.
- You escalated and involved Y by taking his paper.
- Y responded with excessive violence.

The author knowingly misled their boyfriend about their middle name multiple times, intending to keep up the deception as a long-term practical joke. While the author may have thought it was harmless, the boyfriend is understandably upset at being lied to, even if the subject matter (a middle name) is trivial. The author acknowledges that it was a bad joke and that they lied on three separate occasions. The boyfriend's reaction, while perhaps strong, is a response to being deceived, not the cause of the deception. Therefore, the author is at fault for the situation.",stop,407,130,537

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The situation describes feelings of frustration and exhaustion due to a perceived imbalance in shift coverage and time-off requests at work.
- The author is asking if they are ""the asshole"" for feeling this way, not for any specific action.
- Feeling frustrated or exhausted in this situation is a natural emotional response to being overburdened and not having reciprocation from coworkers.
- No one is at fault for having feelings; feelings themselves are not moral failings or wrongdoings.
- The coworker may be inconsiderate or taking advantage, but the question is about the author's feelings, not about actions taken.

- The friend was hurt by the lack of support and the way the author communicated their concerns.
- While the author may have valid worries, the way they communicated (refusing to reply to the engagement text, bluntly saying the relationship is unhealthy, refusing to attend the wedding) was hurtful and unsupportive.
- The author could have chosen a more compassionate, supportive, and tactful way to express their concerns, especially given the timing (immediately after the engagement).
- The friend asked for honesty, but the author’s delivery and refusal to support the wedding crossed a line from honesty into being unsupportive and potentially hurtful.

The author appears to have acted reasonably, intending a short, considerate visit and being flexible when their partner objected. The partner's reaction seems disproportionate and controlling, especially by involving the child and making accusatory statements.

- The author is not demanding anything harmful or unreasonable, but rather communicating their needs.
- However, each person has their own boundaries and comfort levels with physical affection, and not everyone may be able or willing to meet the author's needs.
- The breakdown in relationships seems to stem from a mismatch in needs and expectations, not from malice or wrongdoing.
- Insisting on a need is not inherently wrong, but expecting others to meet it if they are uncomfortable is not reasonable either.
- The author is not at fault for having needs, and the partners are not at fault for having their own boundaries.

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author's Actions:** The author admits to having a crush on Joseph but makes it clear to Joseph that she is happy with Toni and does not want to mislead Joseph or pursue anything romantic. She maintains boundaries in conversation, even if the tone is somewhat emotionally intimate (""what could've been"" conversations). When Joseph makes a physical advance (kissing her), she immediately pulls away, feels guilty, and tells Toni everything. She also tells Joseph she can't see him again.

2. **Joseph's Actions:** Joseph is aware that the author is in a relationship and that she has told him she is not interested in pursuing anything. Despite this, he continues to express hope for a future relationship, initiates physical contact (arm around, holding hands), and ultimately kisses her without clear consent.

3. **Toni's Role:** Toni is not involved in the incident and is only told about it after the fact. He is not angry at the author, possibly because of his prior knowledge of Joseph's behavior.

4. **Fault Assessment:** The author could be seen as slightly naive for allowing emotionally intimate conversations and physical closeness, but she set clear boundaries and did not reciprocate Joseph's advances. The key moment of fault is Joseph's decision to kiss the author despite knowing her relationship status and her stated boundaries.

5. **Conclusion:** The primary fault lies with Joseph (""Other""), as he disregarded the author's boundaries and initiated an unwanted romantic advance. The author responded appropriately by ending contact and being honest with her partner.

Based on the situation described, the primary problematic behavior is coming from the roommate's girlfriend.

While mental illness can be extremely debilitating, refusing all offers of help and being physically abusive crosses a line. The author expressed concern and offered support, which is reasonable.

The main conflict centers around the girlfriend's dad's behavior.

The author’s minor infraction (eating a fry) does not justify the dad’s extreme response. The dad also created a tense environment by yelling about the drink order and being generally hostile. The author tried to help and was making an effort to get along. Therefore, the girlfriend's dad is primarily at fault for escalating the situation and treating the author poorly.",stop,622,148,770

- The author escalated the situation by being pushy (stealing her shoe, pressuring her) and then insulting her (""little shit"") and blaming her publicly.
- The author did not respect May's boundaries or her right to privacy regarding her personal issues.
- While it would have been helpful for May to communicate more, she is not obligated to disclose personal problems.
- The author’s reaction (shouting, public blame) was disproportionate and caused unnecessary drama.

Therefore, the author is primarily at fault for not respecting May’s autonomy and for handling the situation poorly.",stop,598,172,770

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Pressure and Manipulation:** The author was subjected to sustained pressure from their best friend, her friends, and even their own friends, all trying to get them to admit to a crush. This is a form of social pressure and manipulation, which is inappropriate and unfair.

2. **Author’s Response:** The author eventually gave in and said they had a crush, not because they genuinely felt it, but because of the pressure. When they realized their feelings weren’t genuine, they were honest and told their friend the truth.

3. **Friend’s Reaction:** The friend was upset and called the author “mentally weak” for “breaking under so little pressure.” This is dismissive and unsympathetic, especially considering the author was honest and vulnerable.

4. **Fault Assessment:** The author’s only “fault” was being honest about their feelings, both when pressured and when they realized the truth. The real issue is the group’s and the friend’s persistent pressure and lack of respect for the author’s boundaries and feelings.

**Conclusion:** The fault lies with the friend and the group who pressured the author, not the author themselves. The author acted as best as they could under difficult circumstances and was honest when it mattered.

Final Answer: Everybody

Step by step reasoning:
- Your girlfriend reorganized your room without asking, which is inconsiderate and can be frustrating for you.
- She apologized, but her apologies were qualified with ""but..."" statements, which can feel insincere or like she's shifting blame.
- You asked her to apologize again, specifically without qualifications, which is a reasonable request if you feel the apology wasn't genuine.
- However, repeatedly asking for apologies and insisting on a specific form can escalate the situation and make the other person feel attacked or frustrated.
- The argument escalated, with both of you saying things that contributed to the conflict (her calling you names, you insisting on repeated apologies).
- Both parties contributed to the escalation and miscommunication.

Therefore, both of you share some responsibility for how the situation unfolded.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   The author is frustrated with their friend's behavior, which they perceive as ""trying too hard"" to be LGBT and acting in ways the author finds cringy or embarrassing. The author is considering telling their friend that she ""makes the LGBT community look bad.""

2. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The friend is behaving in a way that the author finds annoying and embarrassing, but the behaviors described (e.g., joking about gender, making loud comments) are not inherently malicious or harmful, though they may be socially awkward or inappropriate in some contexts.
   - The author is considering making a statement that is judgmental and potentially hurtful: ""you make the LGBT community look bad."" This statement polices another person's identity and expression, and implies that there is a ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to be LGBT, which is unfair and can be damaging.

3. **Analysis:**  
   - The friend's behavior may be annoying or socially inappropriate, but it is not inherently ""at fault"" in a moral sense—she is expressing herself, even if awkwardly.
   - The author, by considering telling her friend she ""makes the LGBT community look bad,"" is at fault for potentially shaming or gatekeeping her friend's identity and expression.
   - The question is ""Would I Be The Asshole (WIBTA) if I told her...?""—so the evaluation is about the author's contemplated action, not the friend's behavior.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The author would be at fault if they said this to their friend, as it would be judgmental and potentially hurtful, regardless of how annoying the friend's behavior is.

**Therefore:**

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Author’s Actions:** The author did not demand her husband stop his hobby to make dinner, even though he had previously offered. When it got late and she was hungry, she made alternative arrangements (ordering food) and checked if he wanted anything.

2. **Husband’s Actions:** The husband got absorbed in his hobby and lost track of time, not following through on his offer to make dinner. When the author ordered food, he was upset she hadn’t told him she was hungry or reminded him about dinner.

3. **Communication:** There was a miscommunication about expectations. The author assumed it would be rude to interrupt or demand, while the husband expected her to communicate her needs more directly.

4. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The author acted reasonably by not wanting to interrupt her husband’s enjoyment and by making her own arrangements when his offer didn’t materialize.
   - The husband could have been more mindful of his commitment, but he also expected more direct communication.
   - Neither party acted maliciously or irresponsibly; this is a classic case of mismatched communication styles and expectations.

5. **Conclusion:** This is a misunderstanding, not a case of clear fault. Both acted in ways that made sense to them, and the issue arose from differing assumptions about communication and courtesy.

Therefore, **nobody is at fault**—this is a situation that calls for a conversation about expectations, not blame.",stop,535,305,840

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author was a passenger in a car accident where their girlfriend may have been at fault.
   - The girlfriend accused the other driver of racist behavior and claimed he hit her on purpose.
   - The author did not witness any racist remarks or intentional behavior from the other driver.
   - The police sided with the girlfriend, ticketed the other driver, and the insurance company is pursuing him for damages.
   - The author did not speak up to correct the record, despite knowing the truth.

2. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The girlfriend is at fault for lying and making false accusations, which had serious consequences for the other driver.
   - The author is at fault for not speaking up, knowing the truth, and allowing an innocent person to be blamed and penalized.
   - The police may have been biased, but they acted on the information provided to them.
   - The other driver, based on the author's account, did not do anything wrong.

3. **Who is the question about?**  
   - The question is: ""Am I the asshole for not speaking up?""  
   - The author is asking if they are at fault for their inaction.

4. **Direct Answer:**  
   - Yes, the author is at fault for not speaking up when they knew the truth and could have prevented an injustice.

**Conclusion:**  
While the girlfriend is also at fault for her actions, the question specifically asks about the author's responsibility for not speaking up. Therefore, the correct answer is:

- The author has been dealing with a difficult situation: a coworker with poor hygiene that affects others.
- The author tried subtle hints for months, which were ignored.
- Eventually, the author confronted the coworker directly, in front of others, and showed evidence of the problem.
- The coworker was upset, likely due to the public nature of the confrontation.

While the coworker’s lack of hygiene is problematic, the author is at fault for how the situation was handled. Addressing such a sensitive issue publicly, rather than privately, is generally considered inappropriate and unnecessarily humiliating. The correct approach would have been a private, respectful conversation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The author is not the one who created the financial problems or manipulated family members; they are reacting to a difficult situation.
- The mom is clearly behaving unethically by borrowing money from her children, hiding it from her husband, and manipulating her kids.
- The author is in a tough position and is seeking advice, not acting maliciously or irresponsibly.
- The question is about whether the author is at fault for not telling or for potentially telling, but as of now, they have not done anything wrong—they are just unsure how to proceed.
- Therefore, at this moment, nobody is at fault for the current state of affairs as described by the author. The mom is at fault for her actions, but the question is about the author's responsibility, and they have not done anything wrong yet.",stop,496,217,713

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author's actions:** The author is dating someone she loves and is comfortable with the arrangements in their relationship (splitting bills, transportation, etc.). She has communicated her perspective to her family and friends.

2. **Boyfriend's actions:** There is no evidence in the situation that the boyfriend is mistreating the author or acting inappropriately. The complaints from the family are based on traditional expectations, not on any clear wrongdoing.

3. **Family and friends' actions:** The family and friends are expressing their opinions, which are rooted in traditional values. While their persistence may be frustrating, they are not necessarily at fault for having different values, though their inability to accept the author's choices is causing tension.

4. **Fault assessment:** No one in the situation is acting maliciously or with clear intent to harm. The conflict arises from a difference in values and expectations, not from anyone doing something objectively wrong.

5. **Conclusion:** This is a classic case of a values clash, not a case of someone being ""at fault."" The author is not wrong for being tired or considering her options, nor are the family and friends inherently wrong for their beliefs (though their lack of acceptance is problematic). The boyfriend is not at fault based on the information given.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Situation Summary**: The author is considering ""testing"" her boyfriend by intentionally withholding sex and not wearing makeup, to see if he is truly interested in her as a person or just for her looks/status, after receiving a concerning message from his friend.

2. **Fault Analysis**:
   - The boyfriend may or may not be at fault, depending on whether the friend's claim is true. However, there is no direct evidence provided that the boyfriend has actually done anything wrong.
   - The friend could be at fault for potentially spreading rumors or trying to cause drama, but the author acknowledges uncertainty about the friend's motives.
   - The author is considering a course of action (testing her boyfriend without his knowledge) that involves deception and withholding affection/sex as a ""test,"" rather than communicating her concerns directly.

3. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Testing a partner in this way, without open communication, is generally considered manipulative and unfair. It undermines trust and does not address the root issue (the author's insecurity and the rumor).
   - The healthiest approach would be to have an honest conversation with the boyfriend about her concerns and the message she received.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the author is the one proposing a potentially harmful and deceptive action, and there is no evidence that anyone else has actually done something wrong (the boyfriend's alleged behavior is unconfirmed, and the friend's motives are unclear), the author is at fault for considering this course of action.

Confidence is high because the ethical issue is clear: testing a partner in this way is not justified, regardless of the circumstances, and open communication is the appropriate response.",stop,637,351,988

- The author is asking her boyfriend not to go unless she can go too, even though she acknowledges she doesn't want to keep him from his friends.
- The boyfriend is not excluding the author; the group simply doesn't have space.

Step by step reasoning:

- The author is aware that the current arrangement consistently excludes one person, who has expressed feeling left out and has asked for a fairer system.
- The author rationalizes not using their car because their friend doesn't ask for gas money, but this doesn't address the fairness or kindness of the situation.
- The exclusion is not accidental; it's a repeated, avoidable choice.
- While the friend with the car is also making exclusionary decisions, the author specifically asks if they are at fault for not solving the problem when they could.

Final Answer: Author

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Group Norms:** The group has a culture of making jokes at each other's expense, often with few boundaries. The author notes that ""nothing seems to be off limits,"" and Bob is described as ""the king of offensive jokes."" This suggests a high tolerance for ribbing, but also that lines can be crossed.

2. **The Incident:** The author made a joke about Bob's supposed lack of money, referencing Bob's frequent excuses about not being able to afford things. The joke was: ""the dude who can't even afford to get a drink at a bar on a Friday night is cool with this place, and I'm the one trying to save some money?"" and then called him a ""poor bitch.""

3. **Bob's Reaction:** Bob responded with ""eat my ass"" (in line with the group's banter), but then later said, ""Sorry guys, I can't afford to go on your fancy rich vacation, guess I'm out,"" and clarified, ""I've literally never said I didn't have the money to do something, and if I did it's because I just didn't want to hang out."" This indicates that the joke hit a nerve, possibly because it exposed a personal truth or because money is a sensitive topic for him.

4. **Aftermath:** The author apologized privately, and Bob explained that ""money just isn't something we joke about because we all come from different financial situations."" This is a clear boundary that the author was not aware of, but now is.

5. **Fault Assessment:**  
   - The author made a joke that, while in line with the group's general banter, touched on a sensitive subject for Bob and possibly others in the group.
   - The author did not know this was a boundary, but once it was made clear, apologized.
   - Bob had been using money as an excuse to avoid plans, which could be seen as misleading, but this is a common social tactic to avoid awkwardness.
   - The group did not intervene or clarify boundaries before, but the author is the one who crossed the line in this instance.

6. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for making a joke about a sensitive topic without knowing it was off-limits, but ignorance of the boundary does not absolve the action.
   - The author took responsibility and apologized, which is the right thing to do.
   - The group and Bob could have communicated this boundary earlier, but the immediate fault for the awkwardness and hurt feelings lies with the author.

- The author has tried to set boundaries (""When I tell her I don't want to talk..."").
- The co-worker responds with behavior that the author finds bizarre and uncomfortable.
- There is no indication that the author has been rude or intentionally hurtful; they are simply trying to manage their own comfort and boundaries.
- The co-worker may have social or emotional challenges due to her self-identified autism, which could explain her behavior, but does not necessarily make her ""at fault"" in a moral sense.
- There is no evidence of malice or wrongdoing from either party; it is a difficult social situation, not a case of clear fault.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault here for several reasons:

1. **Invasion of Privacy:** Asking to see a partner's private messages or demanding passwords is a significant invasion of privacy, regardless of the circumstances. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and violating that trust by snooping or demanding access to private conversations is generally considered inappropriate.

2. **Controlling Behavior:** Requesting that a partner refrain from talking to or hugging someone, especially when there is no concrete evidence of wrongdoing, can be seen as controlling. While it's understandable to feel insecure, it's important to communicate those feelings without imposing restrictions on the other person's friendships.

3. **Acknowledgement of Fault:** The author even admits to feeling like an ""asshole"" for asking to see her texts, which shows some self-awareness that the behavior is not justified.

While the girlfriend's actions (such as bringing up her ex and comparing the author to him) may be insensitive and could contribute to the author's insecurity, she has not done anything explicitly wrong or deceitful based on the information provided. The main issue here is the author's response to his own insecurities, which has led to controlling and invasive behavior.

1. **Xavier** sent you (the author) unsolicited lingerie pictures of a woman he was interested in, who is also the ex of another friend (Rauol). He asked you not to tell Rauol.
2. You (the author) showed these private pictures to a group of mutual friends at a bar, after discussing Xavier's interest in the woman. You also told them not to mention it to Rauol.
3. The woman eventually found out that her pictures had been shared, was upset, and broke things off with Xavier. Xavier blames you for ""parading"" her pictures around and making him look bad.

**Fault Analysis:**

- **Xavier's Fault:** He sent you private, intimate pictures of someone else without her consent. This is a serious breach of trust and privacy.
- **Your Fault (Author):** You further violated her privacy by showing the pictures to others, even if it was a brief, one-time thing. Sharing intimate images without consent is wrong, regardless of intent or duration.
- **Friends' Fault:** If any of the friends you showed the picture to told Rauol or otherwise spread the information, they also contributed to the breach of privacy.
- **Rauol's Fault:** Only if he spread the information maliciously, but that's not clear from the story.

**Conclusion:**  
Both you (the author) and Xavier are at fault. Xavier for sending the pictures without consent, and you for showing them to others. The woman is the victim here. The friends may also share some blame if they spread the information, but the main responsibility lies with you and Xavier.

**Reasoning:**
- The author admits to frequently venting about his ex and their disagreements, especially regarding finances and parenting.
- His girlfriend has communicated clear boundaries, saying she doesn't want to hear about his ex anymore and even threatened to end the relationship over it.
- While it's understandable for a parent to be concerned about their children, repeatedly bringing up grievances about an ex—especially in a new relationship—can be emotionally taxing for the partner and may indicate unresolved issues.
- The girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels overwhelmed or uncomfortable with the constant negativity and focus on the ex, rather than on the relationship or the children themselves.
- The author seems to dismiss his girlfriend's feelings by rationalizing his behavior as ""par for the course,"" rather than acknowledging her discomfort or trying to find a compromise.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
Step by step:

1. **Action Taken:** The author, as a joke, liked a photo on Instagram from their sister's account of a guy she liked. This is a breach of privacy and could have social consequences for the sister, especially since it could be interpreted as her making a move or showing interest, which she may not have wanted to signal yet.

2. **Immediate Reaction:** The sister was clearly upset and communicated that she felt disrespected and hurt by the action.

3. **Author's Response:** Instead of acknowledging her feelings, the author told her she was overreacting, which invalidated her feelings and escalated the situation.

4. **Aftermath:** The author did apologize, but the apology may not have been sufficient or sincere enough to address the hurt caused.

**Fault Analysis:**  
- The author initiated the problem by taking an action that directly affected the sister's social life and privacy.
- The author then compounded the issue by dismissing the sister's feelings, which is generally considered disrespectful in interpersonal conflicts.
- The sister's reaction, while strong, is understandable given the context and the social dynamics involved.

**Conclusion:**  
The author is at fault for both the initial action (liking the photo as a joke) and for not handling the aftermath with empathy and understanding. The sister's reaction, while intense, is a response to the author's actions and not an independent fault.

Once the relationship ends, continued possession of those images without the other person's consent is a violation of their privacy and autonomy.

2. **Amanda's Request**: Amanda explicitly asked the author to delete the sensitive images. This is a clear withdrawal of consent for the author to continue possessing them.

3. **Author's Response**: The author refused to delete the images, stating he would keep them for his own enjoyment, despite Amanda's request and discomfort.

4. **Ethical Considerations**: Even if the author has no intention of sharing or using the images maliciously, keeping them against Amanda's wishes is disrespectful and disregards her right to control her own image and privacy.

5. **Comparison**: The author tries to justify his actions by saying he wouldn't care if Amanda kept his photos. However, consent is personal and non-transferable; Amanda's comfort level and boundaries are her own, and the author must respect them.

6. **Conclusion**: The author is at fault for refusing to delete the images after Amanda withdrew her consent.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**
- The author is not at fault for feeling protective of their dog, especially given the dog's history and behavioral challenges.
- The cousin, who has Down syndrome, may not fully understand boundaries with animals and is not acting out of malice.
- The boyfriend's family may not be aware of the dog's specific needs or the author's concerns, as the author did not communicate them.
- The situation is difficult and emotionally charged, but no one is acting with ill intent or clear negligence.
- The author’s frustration is understandable, but not acting on it (by communicating boundaries) does not make them an ""asshole.""
- More communication and education could help, but based on the information given, nobody is clearly at fault.",stop,553,161,714

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author (you) expressed clear feelings for the guy and communicated those feelings to your friend M.
- M initially said she wasn't interested, but still added and communicated with the guy, despite knowing your feelings.
- You told M it would hurt your feelings if she added him, but she did anyway, citing not wanting to look rude.
- M later developed feelings for the guy and chose to pursue him, knowing it would hurt you.
- You then decided you couldn't watch your best friend pursue someone you liked and considered ending the friendship.

Fault assessment:
- M could be seen as inconsiderate for continuing to interact with the guy after knowing your feelings, but she is also entitled to her own feelings and choices.
- You are entitled to your feelings and boundaries, but you cannot control who others like or pursue.
- The guy is not at fault, as he is not part of the friendship dynamic.
- This is a situation where feelings and timing are complicated, but no one has done anything objectively ""wrong"" or malicious—just choices that hurt.

Therefore, while there is hurt and disappointment, there is no clear ""fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. It's a difficult, emotional situation, but not one where blame is appropriate.

- Your ex is the only one on the lease, and she chose to stay for school.
- Your mom is correct from a legal and practical standpoint: you don’t owe your ex anything further.
- However, some might argue there’s a moral courtesy to help, but since you’re no longer together and you’re not using the apartment, it’s not unreasonable to stop paying.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The author expresses strong negative generalizations about women, such as ""most females live on recruit difficulty"" and that ""most women are dressing inappropriately."" These are broad, judgmental statements that stereotype and diminish an entire group based on gender.
2. The author admits to ""slander on women"" and describes their own opinions as potentially offensive, indicating awareness that their views are controversial or hurtful.
3. The author is upset that their friend calls them sexist and an ""asshole,"" but the friend's reaction is a response to the author's repeated negative and sexist comments.
4. The author frames the situation as a difference of opinion, but the content of their statements goes beyond opinion into disrespect and prejudice.
5. The author is seeking validation for their behavior, but the behavior described (judging women for their clothing, making sweeping negative statements about women, and expressing disgust at legal relationships) is clearly at fault for causing conflict.

**Reasoning:**
- The author made a comment about the lead tech's weight (""put all your 95 pounds into it!""), which, even if meant as a joke, could be interpreted as teasing or making fun of his size.
- The lead tech responded with a personal insult about the author's weight (""I'm stronger than your fat ass will ever be""), escalating the situation and making it more personal.
- Both parties engaged in body-related teasing/insults, which is inappropriate in a professional environment and contributed to the negative change in the work atmosphere.
- The other tech did not intervene or help de-escalate, but their role is less central.

Final Answer: Other

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Background:** The author (15) and their twin are required by their father to run as a condition for participating in Civil Air Patrol. The father is a retired Army veteran with a strict, disciplinarian approach.

2. **The Incident:** On a cold, rainy day, the author chooses not to run (as per precedent: cold or rain is usually an excused absence), and instead does a workout at home. The father later says they should have done cardio on the exercise bike, which was not previously specified.

3. **Conflict:** The father escalates the situation, minimizes the author's progress, and threatens punishment for not following his (newly clarified) expectations. The author tries to discuss the value of self-discipline and natural consequences, but the father insists on obedience for its own sake.

4. **Escalation:** The father accuses the author of gaslighting when the author points out a contradiction in his statements. The situation becomes emotionally charged, and the father ends the conversation by belittling the author and sending them to bed.

5. **Analysis of Fault:**
   - The author made a reasonable decision based on past precedent and communicated their actions.
   - The father changed expectations after the fact, minimized the author's efforts, and responded with emotional and verbal escalation.
   - The father's approach is rigid, punitive, and dismissive of the author's attempts at communication and self-improvement.
   - The accusation of gaslighting is unfounded and inappropriate in this context.

6. **Conclusion:** The author is not at fault for the conflict. The father's behavior—moving the goalposts, minimizing progress, and escalating emotionally—is the primary cause of the problem.

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Who is the ""author""?**  
   The author is the person whose 10-week-old puppy was attacked.

2. **What happened?**  
   The author's puppy was placed on the ground by the mother-in-law, in front of a French bulldog with a known history of food aggression, and was attacked.

3. **Who made the critical mistake?**  
   The mother-in-law placed the puppy in a dangerous situation, knowing the French bulldog's history. The sister-in-law and her girlfriend own the aggressive dog and have not managed its behavior or warned others sufficiently.

4. **Did the author do anything wrong?**  
   The author did not put the puppy in harm's way and is upset about the lack of apology and responsibility from the others.

5. **Who is at fault?**  
   The mother-in-law (for her actions), the sister-in-law (for not managing her dog), and the girlfriend (for a non-apologetic apology) are at fault. The author is not at fault.

6. **Is ""everybody"" at fault?**

Final Answer: Nobody

Step by step reasoning:

1. The author bought an item at a low price with the intention to resell it for profit (""eBay flip""). This is a common and legal practice, not inherently unethical.
2. The author shared this intention in a Discord group. Some people in the group reacted negatively, calling the practice ""despicable and disgusting.""
3. The author felt hurt and internalized the criticism, expressing self-hate and frustration.
4. There is no evidence of harm to others: the original seller willingly sold the item at the listed price, and reselling is a normal part of many markets.
5. The negative reaction from the Discord group is an opinion, not an objective moral judgment.
6. The author did not retaliate or escalate the situation.

Conclusion:  
No one in this situation is objectively at fault. The author did nothing wrong by buying and planning to resell the item. The Discord group members are entitled to their opinions, even if they were harsh. The emotional distress is unfortunate, but not the result of clear wrongdoing by any party.

Final Answer: Everybody

**Reasoning:**

Step by step:

1. **Author’s Actions:**  
   - The author has been generous and hospitable, but admits to sometimes feeling resentful about how much she gives.
   - During the lunch, the author made a comment about her friend not eating much and being surprised she was full. While intended as light-hearted, this could be interpreted as judgmental or pressuring about food intake.
   - When the friend responded with comments about eating habits, the author replied with a comment about their relative sizes, which is a sensitive and potentially hurtful topic.

2. **Friend’s Actions:**  
   - The friend responded to the author’s comment by making generalizations about eating habits, implying the author eats too much and calling it “gross” to eat three meals a day. This is judgmental and could be hurtful.
   - The friend’s comments about the author’s eating habits and the “grossness” of eating too much are inappropriate and body-shaming.

3. **Analysis:**  
   - Both parties made comments that could be considered rude or insensitive. The author’s initial comment about her friend’s fullness and later about their relative sizes were both potentially hurtful. The friend’s comments about the author’s eating habits and what is “gross” were also inappropriate.
   - The situation escalated because both parties responded to perceived slights with their own, rather than de-escalating or clarifying intentions.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - Both the author and the friend contributed to the uncomfortable exchange with insensitive remarks. Neither is solely at fault; both could have handled the situation with more tact.

**Summary:**  
Both the author and the friend made comments that were insensitive and contributed to the tension. Therefore, the most accurate answer is ""Everybody.""",stop,885,375,1260

**Reasoning:**
- The author was confronted with a rumor that, if true, would be a serious breach of trust in a relationship.
- The author did not accuse, but rather asked for clarification and expressed concern.
- The girlfriend was understandably upset by the implication, but the author did not act maliciously or irresponsibly.
- The rumor was started by others, not the author or the girlfriend.
- In relationships, communication about concerns is important, even if the concern turns out to be unfounded.
- The author could have approached the conversation more gently, but seeking clarification is not inherently wrong.
- The girlfriend's reaction is also understandable, as being accused of something you didn't do is hurtful.
- The real ""fault"" lies with the spreaders of the rumor, but the question is about the confrontation itself.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author’s mother is trying to be thoughtful by buying clocks to add to a collection she believes the author values.
- The author has repeatedly communicated that they do not want or need more gifts, and that the clocks are not meaningful to them.
- However, the author refers to the gifts as ""junk"" directly to their mother, which is a harsh and potentially hurtful way to describe her effort.
- While it is reasonable to set boundaries and communicate preferences, the choice of words (""junk"") is unnecessarily dismissive and could be seen as disrespectful to the mother’s intentions.
- The mother’s response (""Here's a picture of the junk"") suggests she was hurt or at least affected by the author’s phrasing.
- Therefore, while the mother may not fully understand the author’s wishes, the author is at fault for the way they communicated, not for setting boundaries, but for the lack of tact and empathy in their wording.",stop,341,206,547

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Communication and Expectations:** The author is expressing a desire for basic communication (being informed when their partner goes out, especially with people the author doesn't know). The author is not demanding permission, just information, which is a reasonable expectation in many relationships for trust and safety.

2. **Partner’s Behavior:** The girlfriend sometimes withholds information about her plans, but also sometimes shares. She also sends texts while drunk that make the author anxious, and when confronted, she feels accused of being controlled.

3. **Trust Issues:** The author acknowledges having trust issues and is working on them with a psychologist. The author is making an effort to trust the girlfriend and is not objecting to her going out, just wants to be kept in the loop.

4. **No Clear Malice or Harm:** There is no evidence of intentional harm, manipulation, or controlling behavior from either party. The girlfriend may be less communicative or defensive, possibly due to her own boundaries or misunderstandings, but this does not make her ""at fault"" in a moral sense.

5. **Relationship Dynamics:** The issues described are common in relationships, especially with differing personalities and backgrounds. Both parties have valid feelings and needs, and the situation calls for better communication and understanding, not blame.

- The author communicated her needs (sensory overload, need for quiet to apply for jobs).
- The husband chose to play loud music and sing, disrupting the author’s efforts, despite knowing her needs and the context.
- When confronted, the husband deflected responsibility and blamed the author for not leaving, rather than acknowledging the disruption.
- The author’s reaction (annoyance and a harsh tone) is understandable given the circumstances and ongoing lack of consideration.

- The friend is not at fault for her trauma or for struggling to cope, though her way of expressing it may be difficult for those around her.
- The author is not at fault for feeling uncomfortable or annoyed; emotional fatigue in such situations is normal, and the author has not acted maliciously.

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the author and her husband had a mutually agreed-upon financial arrangement that worked well: he provided most of his paycheck, she managed the bills, and leftover money was split fairly. The husband has unilaterally changed this arrangement by giving her significantly less money, while still expecting her to pay all the bills and manage household expenses. He does not use his retained income to pay any bills, and becomes upset when bills are unpaid or accounts are overdrawn.

The author is not at fault for wanting more money to cover household expenses, as she is still responsible for paying all the bills but is not being given the necessary funds. The husband is at fault for changing the arrangement without discussion and for not taking responsibility for the consequences of his actions.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Context**: The author was in a bad mood and hungry, which can make anyone irritable, but these are explanations, not excuses for behavior.
2. **Situation**: The girlfriend forgot her glasses (a common, minor mistake), and the author delegated the task of retrieving them. When she struggled with the door, the author became visibly angry, went upstairs, grabbed the keys from her, and accidentally bumped her with his shoulder. He then closed the door ""slightly angrily"" and told her it was easy.
3. **Physical Contact**: Even if unintentional, the author physically bumped his girlfriend while angry. This can be perceived as aggressive or dismissive, especially in the context of visible frustration.
4. **Communication**: The author admits to being angry and showing it, and the girlfriend responded by not wanting to ride with him and yelling at him in the street. While her reaction may not be ideal, it was a response to the author's actions.
5. **Responsibility**: The author is asking if he is ""the asshole"" for his reaction. The key issue is whether his anger and physical action were justified or appropriate. Being hungry or in a bad mood does not justify taking out frustration on someone else, especially physically, even if accidental.

**Conclusion**: The author is at fault for letting his frustration escalate to the point of physical contact and for being visibly angry over a minor inconvenience. The girlfriend's forgetfulness and struggle with the door are minor and do not justify the author's reaction. While her yelling is not ideal, it is a reaction to being treated poorly.

Final Answer: Everybody

**Reasoning:**
- **S**: She did not stick to the agreed-upon plan and publicly called out the boys, which could embarrass them and undermine team trust.
- **Author**: While the author tried to address the issue calmly, the ""smile and nod"" technique and reluctance to engage in further discussion may have come across as dismissive, escalating S's feelings of being attacked.
- **Both**: The communication breakdown and inability to resolve the disagreement productively is a shared responsibility. Both parties could have handled the follow-up conversation with more empathy and clarity.
- **Husband**: Not directly at fault, as he didn't get a chance to intervene as planned.

Thus, both the author and S contributed to the conflict and its escalation.",stop,664,169,833

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is expressing their feelings about a difficult friendship, but does not describe any clear wrongdoing on their own part.
- The friend is described as dramatic, manipulative, and inconsiderate, but the situation is presented from the author's perspective only.
- There is no clear evidence of a specific ""fault"" in a moral or ethical sense; rather, this is a case of incompatible personalities and boundaries.
- The author is considering ending the friendship for their own well-being, which is a reasonable response to feeling overwhelmed.
- Without more objective information or the friend's perspective, it's not possible to definitively assign fault.
- However, based on the information given, this seems to be a situation where nobody is strictly ""at fault""—it's a matter of personal boundaries and relationship dynamics.",stop,372,175,547

You also mention that your family did not think you were a good match and that you were lying to them, which suggests the relationship was causing broader issues in your life.

Your ex-girlfriend is upset and wants to get back together, but you are following your family's advice and your own judgment. There is no indication that you ended things in a cruel or irresponsible way—rather, you made a difficult but reasonable decision for your own well-being.

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation, you brought your own bed frame and mattress, while your roommates jointly bought a bunk bed for themselves. There was no prior agreement about rotating sleeping arrangements or sharing beds. You are considering not giving up your solo bed spot, mainly for comfort and because you own the bed. There is no indication of malice, unfairness, or broken agreements—just a lack of initial planning.

You are not at fault for wanting to keep your own bed, especially since you own it and have personal reasons (comfort, tossing and turning, privacy). Your roommates are also not at fault for wanting to discuss the arrangement. The situation is a result of not planning ahead, but no one has acted unreasonably or unfairly.

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Author's Actions:** The author sat at the head of the table for practical reasons and was polite when asked to move. However, when his father asked him to move, he refused, even after being told it would make his father angry. While the author had his reasons, refusing a simple request (even if the reasoning seemed arbitrary) contributed to escalating the situation.

2. **Father's Actions:** The father asked the author to move, but did not provide a clear reason beyond ""that's where I want to sit."" When the author refused, the father escalated by threatening anger rather than explaining or compromising. This is not a constructive way to handle a minor seating dispute, especially as the host and parent.

3. **Family's Actions:** The rest of the family convinced the author to move, which resolved the immediate conflict but did not address the underlying communication issue between father and son. They acted as mediators but did not help foster understanding.

4. **Context:** There was no established seating arrangement, and the situation was not urgent or high-stakes. Both parties could have handled it with more flexibility and communication.

5. **Fault Assessment:** Both the author and the father contributed to the conflict by being inflexible and escalating a minor issue. The family played a minor role in resolving but not addressing the root cause.

Final Answer: Info

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is considering telling Brooke about her husband's ongoing affair, which she knows about only because her husband confided in her after Scott told him in confidence.
- The author’s husband believes it is not their business and that telling would violate his trust and Scott’s confidence.
- The author feels empathy for Brooke and wants to help her, but doing so would break a confidence and potentially damage her own marriage.
- The situation involves multiple layers: Scott is at fault for cheating and lying, Mandy is at fault for her part in the affair, the author’s husband is arguably at fault for not encouraging Scott to come clean, and the author is considering breaking a confidence for what she sees as a moral reason.
- The question is whether the author is at fault for *considering* stepping in, not for actually doing so.

Given the complexity and the fact that the author has not yet acted, but is only considering action, and that there are multiple people with questionable actions, more information is needed to definitively assign fault (e.g., what are the consequences of telling, what is the best way to support Brooke, etc.).

The author made a joke that invoked a sexist stereotype (""That's why women don't belong in the gym""), even if it was intended as a joke and delivered in a ""goofy"" voice. Regardless of intent, the content of the joke is offensive and perpetuates a harmful idea. The fact that the women were regulars and the author acknowledged after the fact that it was inappropriate further supports that the author is at fault. The friend's response, while perhaps blunt, was not inappropriate given the situation.

Final Answer: Info

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Initial Agreement:** The author and boyfriend were upfront in their ad about not being very tidy. The roommate agreed to this before moving in.
2. **Roommate’s Expectations:** After moving in, the roommate expressed discomfort with the level of mess, especially in shared spaces like the kitchen, and asked for more cleanliness.
3. **Response:** The author and boyfriend responded positively, cleaned up, and tried to keep things from getting as messy as before.
4. **Ongoing Issues:** The roommate continues to clean and makes passive-aggressive comments, indicating ongoing dissatisfaction.
5. **Communication:** The roommate is communicating her discomfort, but the author feels they have already compromised and are being unfairly pressured to change further.

**Fault Analysis:**
- The author and boyfriend were transparent about their habits.
- The roommate agreed but now wants a higher standard.
- The author and boyfriend did make an effort to improve after the first complaint.
- The roommate’s continued dissatisfaction and passive-aggressive behavior suggest a mismatch in expectations.

**Conclusion:**  
This is a classic case of mismatched expectations and communication. The author and boyfriend were clear about their habits, and the roommate agreed, but her tolerance for mess is lower than she realized. Both parties have some responsibility: the author for not being as tidy as the roommate would like, and the roommate for agreeing to a situation she’s not comfortable with and not communicating directly or constructively.

**However,** the situation is nuanced and depends on the specifics of what was agreed upon, how messy things actually are, and whether the author and boyfriend are meeting a reasonable standard for shared spaces. Without more detail on the actual state of the house and the specifics of the agreement, it’s hard to assign clear fault.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author’s cotton candy was taken without permission by the girl, which is inconsiderate and disrespectful.
- The author retaliated by cutting up the girl’s cardboard box, which was also her property and needed for class. This is a form of petty revenge and not an appropriate response.
- The girl’s response (“it was just a joke, chill!”) minimizes her own wrongdoing and doesn’t acknowledge that she took something that wasn’t hers.
- The author did attempt to fix the box, but the initial act of cutting it up was still wrong.
- The friends’ reaction (calling the author selfish and stingy) ignores the fact that the author’s property was taken first, but the author’s response was also not justified.

Both the author and the girl acted poorly, and the friends did not help mediate or acknowledge the initial wrongdoing. Therefore, everyone involved shares some fault.",stop,830,198,1028

Your mother-in-law is not at fault for her mental health crisis. The brother-in-law’s behavior (repeatedly asking for money) is problematic, but in the context of your question—whether *you* are being an asshole—there is no clear wrongdoing on your part.

**Reasoning:**
- The author is not at fault for feeling hurt or for not wanting to continue the friendship. Feelings are valid, and it’s reasonable to distance oneself from someone who caused emotional pain, even unintentionally.
- The friend is not strictly ""at fault"" either. While he could have communicated better and been more considerate, he was not in a committed relationship with the author and was free to pursue someone else. His actions were inconsiderate, but not malicious or unethical.
- There was no explicit agreement or commitment, so neither party ""owes"" the other anything beyond basic respect.
- The situation is unfortunate and emotionally difficult, but it does not rise to the level of anyone being an ""asshole"" or at fault in a moral sense.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author’s mother has become obsessed with a singing app, to the point of neglecting family interactions and responsibilities.
   - She uses earphones constantly, even while driving (which is dangerous), and gets angry when interrupted.
   - She reacts defensively and sometimes emotionally manipulates (threatening self-harm, playing the victim) when confronted.
   - The author feels guilty and insecure, but has tried to communicate their feelings and concerns.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The author is not at fault for feeling upset or for wanting to communicate with their mother.
   - The mother’s behavior is problematic: neglecting family, unsafe driving, emotional outbursts, and not being receptive to reasonable concerns.
   - The father is frustrated but not described as behaving inappropriately.
   - The author’s sister is not described as doing anything wrong.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - The mother’s actions are causing the problem. The author is not responsible for their mother’s choices or reactions.
   - The author’s attempts to communicate are reasonable and not blameworthy.
   - The main fault lies with the mother for her neglectful and unsafe behavior, and for her poor handling of family concerns.

- While there may be underlying reasons for the author's behavior (e.g., mental health, burnout), based on the information given, the author is responsible for their actions and the facade they are maintaining.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step by step reasoning:
- The author is under significant stress, caring for both his wife and daughter, and now his mother.
- The siblings live far away (one in another state, one overseas), which makes direct, hands-on help difficult, but not impossible (they could offer financial or logistical support).
- The author feels abandoned and overwhelmed, and expressed this frustration in a ""bitchy"" email.
- The siblings are upset at the tone/content of the email, but the underlying issue is a lack of support.
- The author has a history of feeling like the only one stepping up for family care.
- While the author could have communicated more diplomatically, the core issue is a lack of shared responsibility.
- The siblings may not have realized the extent of the burden, or may have assumed the author was handling things.
- No one is malicious; the situation is a result of poor communication and differing expectations.

Therefore, while the email may have been harsh, the frustration is understandable, and the siblings' lack of involvement is also problematic. However, this is a common family dynamic and not a clear case of anyone being ""at fault"" in a moral sense—just a difficult, emotionally charged situation.

Final Answer: Info

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The situation involves a complex intersection of genetics, religion, ethics, and family dynamics.
- The ""author"" is considering whether they would be ""the asshole"" (WIBTA) for suggesting abortion or vasectomy to their brother, who is at risk of having another child with Tay Sachs disease due to both parents being carriers.
- The brother and his wife are practicing Catholics, and their beliefs likely prohibit abortion and contraception.
- The author is struggling with the emotional and financial consequences for the family, and is angry at the couple for their choices.
- The question is not about a specific action taken, but about whether the author would be at fault for making a suggestion that goes against the couple's beliefs and choices.

Analysis:
- Fault is difficult to assign here because:
  - The brother and his wife are making choices consistent with their religious beliefs, which is their right.
  - The author is concerned for the well-being of the potential child and the family, which is understandable.
  - Suggesting abortion or vasectomy could be seen as insensitive or disrespectful to the couple's beliefs, but it could also be seen as caring about the family's future.
  - The actual ""fault"" depends on how the suggestion is made, the relationship dynamics, and the couple's openness to such discussions.

Conclusion:
- There is not enough information to definitively assign fault to the author, the brother and his wife, or anyone else.
- The situation is highly nuanced and context-dependent.
- More information is needed about how the conversation would be approached, the family's communication style, and the couple's willingness to discuss these topics.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation summary:**  
   - The author joined a friend's Instagram live.
   - The friend was wearing a green bandana with an abortion rights symbol.
   - The author made a joke referencing ""banditos"" from the band 21 Pilots, calling her a ""killerbaby bandito.""
   - The friend was offended, blocked the author, and told them to stop talking to her.

2. **Analysis:**  
   - The author made a comment that, intentionally or not, equated the friend's pro-choice stance (symbolized by the green bandana) with being a ""killer"" (i.e., ""killerbaby""), which is a highly sensitive and potentially offensive statement, especially in the context of abortion rights.
   - Even if the author intended it as a 21 Pilots reference, the wording and context were inappropriate and could easily be interpreted as an insult or accusation.
   - The friend’s reaction (anger, blocking, and calling the author an ""asshole"") suggests she was hurt and offended by the comment.

3. **Fault assessment:**  
   - The author is at fault for making an insensitive and potentially offensive comment, regardless of intent.
   - The friend’s reaction, while strong, is understandable given the context and the nature of the comment.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Author's Position:** The author is concerned about the safety and well-being of their own family, given the friend's history with drugs, criminal investigations, and an abusive ex-partner. The author is not refusing to help, but is offering a compromise by providing financial support for rent rather than inviting the friend into their home.

2. **Wife's Position:** The wife wants to help her friend by offering her a place to stay, believing it would be a good lesson in compassion for their children.

3. **Friend's Situation:** The friend is in a difficult and dangerous situation, but her presence could bring risk to the author's household.

4. **Fault Analysis:** 
   - The author is not at fault for prioritizing the safety of their family and offering a reasonable alternative.
   - The wife is not at fault for wanting to help her friend in need.
   - The friend is not at fault for needing help, given her circumstances.
   - There is no evidence of malice or irresponsibility from any party in the decision-making process.

5. **Conclusion:** This is a difficult situation with no clear ""fault."" Both the author and the wife have valid perspectives, and the author is still offering help, just in a different form. The disagreement is about the method of helping, not about whether to help at all.

- The author is questioning their own feelings, not taking any action that would be considered ""at fault.""
- The company may have financial reasons for the smaller bonus, but giving a small bonus is not inherently wrong or malicious.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author expresses discomfort with friends making broad, negative statements about men, which is understandable since such statements can feel personally hurtful and are, in general, unfair generalizations.
- The author communicated their feelings privately and respectfully, not in a confrontational or public way.
- The friend's response was dismissive and included an ad hominem implication (""if you find it offensive, you must be doing something bad""), which is unfair and does not address the author's feelings.
- The friend's justification for her language (""it's different because men deserve it"") is problematic, as it relies on stereotyping and double standards.
- The author used a comparison to illustrate the double standard, which, while provocative, was intended to highlight the inconsistency in logic, not to actually express hatred.
- The mutual friends' reaction (""you're taking it too seriously"") further dismisses the author's legitimate feelings.

Given all this, the author is not at fault for expressing discomfort and seeking a respectful conversation. The fault lies with the friend(s) for making broad, negative statements and dismissing the author's feelings rather than engaging in a thoughtful discussion.

Final Answer: Author

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author and his ex had a tumultuous, on-and-off relationship for two years.
   - The ex would break up with the author, date others to make him jealous, and then return.
   - After the final breakup, the ex quickly started dating the author's friend and engaged in sexual behavior with another friend.
   - The author is upset and wonders if he is wrong for thinking her behavior is ""too much"" and for calling her a ""slut.""

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The ex's behavior (dating others quickly, sending nudes, etc.) may be considered inconsiderate or hurtful, especially given the proximity to the breakup and the involvement of the author's friends. However, her actions are her own, and after a breakup, she is not obligated to the author.
   - The friends' participation may be questionable in terms of loyalty, but the main question is about the author's reaction.
   - The author is asking if he is an ""asshole"" for thinking her behavior is ""too much"" and for calling her a ""slut.""

3. **Key Issue:**  
   - The term ""slut"" is a derogatory, misogynistic slur. Judging or shaming someone for their sexual behavior, especially with such language, is inappropriate and harmful.
   - Feeling hurt or betrayed is understandable, but resorting to name-calling and slut-shaming is not justified.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for using misogynistic language and for shaming his ex for her sexual behavior, regardless of how hurt he feels.  
   - It is valid to feel hurt or betrayed, but it is not acceptable to use derogatory language or judge someone’s sexual choices in this way.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author admits to making a ""snide dumb joke"" about their mother's dietary restrictions, which they acknowledge was unkind. While the mother's beliefs about her intolerances may be unfounded medically, the question is about fault in this specific interaction. The author recognizes that their comment was unnecessary and could make their mother feel bad about her choices.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author repeatedly takes food from his girlfriend's plate, even after she says no.
- He sometimes pushes her to say yes, which is disrespectful of her boundaries.
- He justifies taking her food by saying men need more food, which is not a fair or considerate argument in this context.
- He does not offer her any of his food, and she cannot try his because of her dietary restrictions.
- The girlfriend communicates her feelings and boundaries, but the author disregards them.
- Sharing food can be normal in relationships, but only when both parties are comfortable and consent to it.
- The ongoing argument and her pouting indicate that this is a recurring issue that bothers her.

- The boyfriend tried dog meat in a different cultural context, out of curiosity, and does not seem to have any ongoing intent to repeat it or harm dogs.
- The boyfriend was honest about his experience and did not try to hide it.
- The author is considering breaking up because she cannot reconcile her feelings with his actions, which is her right.
- No one in this situation is being malicious, deceitful, or intentionally hurtful.
- The breakup would be based on incompatible values, not wrongdoing.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Background**: The author and the boy have a long, complicated history as friends and on-and-off romantic partners. They made childhood promises to each other, but as they grew up, their relationship became more complex and ambiguous.

2. **Recent Events**: They had unprotected sex, were caught, and the author experienced a miscarriage and severe family consequences. The boy did not check in on the author after the incident, which upset the author, leading to a breakup.

3. **Current Situation**: The boy is moving on, seeking clarity and closure, and is seen with another girl. The author feels hurt and jealous, despite having told him she only sees him as a friend.

4. **Fault Analysis**:
   - The author is not at fault for feeling hurt or confused; emotions are complex, especially after trauma.
   - The boy is not at fault for moving on after being told the author only sees him as a friend.
   - Both parties have made mistakes (poor communication, risky behavior), but these are typical of young people in complicated situations.
   - The real harm (family abuse, being kicked out) was caused by the author's parents, not by either the author or the boy.

5. **Conclusion**: There is no clear ""fault"" in the sense of someone being morally wrong in this situation. Both are young, have made mistakes, and are dealing with difficult emotions. The author is not an ""asshole"" for feeling upset, nor is the boy for moving on.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step by step reasoning:

1. **Situation Overview:** The author is struggling with their own mental health and has just experienced a traumatic event involving a friend's suicide attempt. The author helped save their friend, cleaned up, and is now feeling overwhelmed and triggered.

2. **Moral Dilemma:** The author is asking if they would be an ""asshole"" for taking care of themselves (by going camping and not visiting their friend in the hospital), or if they are obligated to ""suck it up"" and be there for their friend despite the toll on their own mental health.

3. **Fault Analysis:**
   - The author is not at fault for needing to take care of their own mental health. In fact, self-care is crucial, especially after a traumatic event.
   - The friend who attempted suicide is not at fault either; they are suffering from severe mental health issues.
   - The author already did a lot to help: they called for help, performed CPR, cleaned up, and visited the friend.
   - There is no indication that anyone else (other friends, authorities, etc.) is at fault in this scenario.

4. **Conclusion:** This is a situation where nobody is at fault. Both the author and their friend are struggling with mental health, and the author has already gone above and beyond to help. It is not selfish to take care of oneself, especially when one's own well-being is at risk.

- The family is upset and gossiping, but this is more a matter of family dynamics and concern, not necessarily ""fault"" in a moral or legal sense.
- The author is not reporting any immediate harm to themselves or others as a result of stopping medication.
- The mother posting on Facebook is arguably inappropriate, but not directly ""at fault"" for the situation described.
- The author’s psychologist is involved and aware, and there is no indication of professional misconduct.
- The situation is primarily about personal autonomy and family disagreement, not a clear-cut case of someone being ""at fault.""

Final Answer: Everybody

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Joint Account Expectations:**  
   - The joint account is for shared expenses: groceries, work, maintenance.
   - Both contribute, but the author contributes more due to higher income and inheritance.
   - The boyfriend manages the account more frequently.

2. **The Purchase:**  
   - The author bought $130 heels for a work event and charged it to the joint account.
   - She considers it a work expense, as the event is work-related and the heels are required for the dress code.

3. **Boyfriend’s Reaction:**  
   - He is upset, arguing that heels are not a legitimate work expense and compares it to buying expensive sneakers and calling them a work expense.
   - He expects her to repay the account.

4. **Double Standard:**  
   - The author points out the boyfriend spends $300/week on weed, which he considers a work expense due to job stress and culture.
   - She feels this is a double standard.

5. **Communication:**  
   - The author did not discuss the purchase beforehand, only after the fact.
   - The boyfriend’s reaction is emotional, and he leaves to cool off.

6. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - **Author:** Could have communicated before making a non-routine purchase from the joint account, especially since it’s a personal item (even if for work).
   - **Boyfriend:** Is inconsistent in what he considers a work expense, and spends much more on weed, which is arguably less essential than required attire for a work event.
   - **Both:** There is a lack of clear, shared guidelines about what counts as a “work expense” from the joint account, leading to misunderstandings and resentment.

7. **Conclusion:**  
   - Both parties are at fault: the author for not communicating and assuming the purchase was justified, and the boyfriend for having a double standard and not addressing the broader issue of what counts as a work expense.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is concerned about their friend's decision to adopt a husky, given the circumstances with the older dog and the couple's work schedules.
- The author is debating whether to be more honest and direct with their friend about their concerns.
- The friend and her boyfriend are making a decision that the author disagrees with, but there is no evidence of malice or irresponsibility beyond the author's opinion.
- The author has already gently raised concerns, and the friend responded defensively.
- No one has actually done anything wrong yet; the situation is about whether to give advice, not about an action that has caused harm.
- The author is not at fault for having concerns or for wanting to help.
- The friend is not at fault for considering adopting a dog or for being defensive about her choices.
- There is no evidence that anyone else is involved or at fault.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author and her ex had a child in high school.
   - They broke up after the author cheated.
   - They agreed on a child support amount based on his part-time income.
   - The author now has two more children with a new partner, is a stay-at-home mom, and lives with her father, who is now unemployed due to medical issues.
   - The ex has occasionally given extra money when asked, but lectures her about responsibility.
   - The ex is about to graduate and get a full-time job.
   - The author is considering asking for more child support to help support her whole family.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - **Child support is for the child, not the whole family.** The ex is responsible for supporting his child, not the author's other children or her household.
   - **Asking for more child support because the ex's income is increasing is reasonable, but only if it is for the shared child.**  
   - **However, the author explicitly states she wants more money to support her whole family, not just the shared child.** This is not appropriate; the ex is not responsible for the author's other children or her household's financial situation.
   - **The ex has already been generous by giving extra money when asked, despite not seeing his child often.**

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author would be at fault if she asks for more child support specifically to support her whole family, rather than for the needs of the shared child.  
   - The ex is only responsible for his own child, not the author's other children or her household.

- When the 16-year-old expressed discomfort (""he said no"" and ""he kept saying he wasn't into that""), the author did not stop immediately or apologize, but instead continued with dark humor.
- The author then messaged the minor in a way that could be seen as confrontational, and escalated the situation by insulting him (""basically an insect,"" ""won't amount to anything in life"").
- The 16-year-old's actions (contacting the author's fiancé, taunting, talking about the author) are immature, but he is a minor and was responding to feeling uncomfortable or possibly harassed.

- The author cut the person off and responded with impatience and hostility (""DUDE! WHAT.DO.YOU.WANT!?!?"").
- While the panhandler's approach may be frustrating, the author acknowledges their own overreaction.

- The author can express concern, offer support, and encourage open communication, but cannot dictate or control the sister's relationships.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author’s close friend (Friend A) was sexually abused by another friend (Friend B).
   - Friend B was mentally ill at the time, but the author did not excuse her actions.
   - Friend B has since improved her mental health and seems to have changed.
   - The author is considering a romantic relationship with Friend B (the abuser).
   - The author is aware this would deeply hurt Friend A and is planning to keep it secret from her.
   - Another mutual friend (Friend A’s boyfriend) knows and is also keeping the secret.

2. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The author is knowingly engaging in a relationship with someone who abused their close friend.
   - The author is planning to keep this relationship secret specifically to avoid hurting the victim, which involves deception and a breach of trust.
   - The author’s actions risk further harm to the victim if the truth comes out, and the secrecy itself is a form of betrayal.
   - While Friend B’s past actions were abhorrent, the question is about the author’s current actions and moral responsibility.
   - The boyfriend is complicit in the secrecy, but the author is the primary actor making the choice.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for prioritizing their own desires over the well-being and trust of their abused friend, and for planning to deceive her.
   - The author’s actions are ethically questionable, regardless of Friend B’s current state or remorse.

   - The author declined, offering to make something simpler for dinner instead.
   - The mom became upset, saying it was unfair, and later made comments implying the author was negative, cruel, and abusive.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The author did not refuse to help entirely; they offered an alternative (making a simpler dinner).
   - The author was under significant stress and communicated their exhaustion.
   - The mom escalated the situation by making personal and public comments about the author's character, which seems disproportionate to the situation.
   - There is no evidence the author was actually cruel or abusive; they simply set a boundary due to exhaustion.

You (the author) are not at fault for setting a boundary about your own body, especially as your discomfort and the severity of your breakouts have increased. You communicated your needs and reasons clearly. Your girlfriend, on the other hand, is at fault for not respecting your bodily autonomy, getting angry, and insisting that you ""sacrifice"" your comfort for her compulsion, even after you explained your position. While her compulsion may be difficult for her, it does not override your right to say no. Therefore, the fault lies with the other person (the girlfriend), not you.",stop,865,137,1002

1. **Initial Incident**: You were walking, drunk, and a guy (also likely drunk) either punched you in the face or accidentally hit you. You are unsure if it was intentional or not.

2. **Your Response**: You retaliated by throwing him to the ground and stomping on his face three times, causing blood and injury, while he was unable to defend himself.

3. **Aftermath**: You left the scene, feeling vulnerable, and later reflected that your reaction was much stronger than what you received.

**Fault Analysis:**
- The other guy may have been at fault for hitting you first, but you are not sure if it was intentional.
- Your response was to escalate the situation significantly, causing serious harm to someone who was not defending himself at that point.
- The use of force was disproportionate to the initial incident, especially since you were unsure of the intent and the severity of the initial hit.

**Moral and Legal Perspective:**
- Self-defense is generally justified only when the response is proportional to the threat.
- Retaliating with excessive violence, especially when the other person is no longer a threat, is not justified.
- Your friends' negative reaction is likely because your response was excessive and could be seen as assault.

**Conclusion:**
- The initial hit (if intentional) was wrong, but your response was far more severe and unjustified, especially given your uncertainty about the intent.
- The main fault lies with you for escalating and causing serious harm.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is considering taking a trip to Peru with a cousin, which would require leaving his wife to care for their three young children for about a week.
- The author is not neglectful or irresponsible in general; he is very involved with his family and rarely takes time for himself.
- The trip is motivated by a desire for self-improvement, both physically and mentally, and the author believes it could benefit his family in the long run.
- The wife is upset, which is understandable given the challenge of solo parenting three young kids for a week, but her reaction is not described as abusive or unreasonable.
- There is no evidence of malice, neglect, or irresponsibility from either party—just a difficult situation with valid feelings on both sides.

Conclusion: This is a situation where both parties have reasonable perspectives and needs. The author is not at fault for wanting to take a trip for self-improvement, and the wife is not at fault for feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of solo parenting. The situation calls for communication and compromise, not blame.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
- The author is asking if they are at fault (""the asshole"") for showing their boyfriend evidence that his best friend behaves inappropriately toward women.
- The boyfriend's best friend is clearly at fault for his inappropriate and disrespectful behavior, as evidenced by the screenshots and corroborated by multiple women.
- The boyfriend is upset with the author for revealing the truth, not for fabricating or misrepresenting anything.
- The author did not create the situation; they simply brought important information to light, which is reasonable and responsible, especially given the seriousness of the behavior.
- The boyfriend's reaction—resenting the author for showing him the truth and blaming her for ""ruining"" his friendship—is misplaced. The blame lies with the best friend for his actions, not with the author for revealing them.

**Reasoning:**  
The author, as the adult and coach responsible for the students, allowed a group of high school girls to wear bikini tops and cut-off shorts for a public fundraiser. Even though the students requested it and enjoyed themselves, and even though nothing explicitly bad happened, the author should have recognized the potential for inappropriate attention, safety concerns, and the likelihood of parental and community backlash. The guidelines (even if not strict rules) exist for a reason, and as a new teacher/coach, the author should have erred on the side of caution and either denied the request or sought explicit approval from administration and parents. The responsibility for student safety and appropriateness of activities falls on the adult in charge. Therefore, the author is at fault.",stop,534,163,697

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author explains that he rarely posts on social media and has not deliberately avoided posting about his girlfriend.
- He did acknowledge their relationship publicly on her birthday via an Instagram story.
- The girlfriend values public displays of affection on social media and feels hurt by the lack of a post.
- The disagreement stems from differing expectations and values regarding social media, not from malice or neglect.
- The author communicated his reasoning and did not act out of secrecy or disrespect.
- The girlfriend’s reaction, while emotional, is based on her own expectations and feelings, not on any clear wrongdoing by the author.
- This is a classic case of mismatched expectations, not clear fault.

- The boyfriend (the third party) is not at fault, as he was unaware and was cheated on.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step by step reasoning:
- The girl made a flippant joke about a sensitive topic (the death of a beloved staff member). While this could be seen as inappropriate, people do cope with grief in different ways, including humor.
- The author responded by calling out the comment as ""kind of harsh,"" which is a mild and honest reaction, especially since others seemed uncomfortable.
- The author is questioning whether they were wrong (""AITA"") for calling out the comment, but did so in a non-aggressive way.
- The other students did not intervene, but their discomfort suggests the comment was out of line for the group.
- No one escalated the situation, and both parties' actions are understandable given the context of grief and group dynamics.

Therefore, nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a moral sense—one person coped with humor, another set a boundary, and the group processed it quietly. This is a normal, if awkward, social interaction in a difficult time.",stop,429,211,640

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The author is being clear and reasonable in their expectations: if two adults live together, both should contribute to rent or, if not possible, contribute in other ways (chores, etc.).
- The author even offered flexibility: calculating rent as a percentage of income, or contributing through chores if unable to pay.
- The boyfriend/ex refuses to pay rent, refuses to do chores, and calls the suggestion ""slavery"" and ""controlling,"" which is an unreasonable and emotionally manipulative response.
- The boyfriend/ex also gets angry and accuses the author of not loving him when she disagrees, which is not a fair or healthy way to handle conflict.
- The author is not at fault for wanting a partner to contribute to shared living expenses or responsibilities.

Therefore, the boyfriend/ex is at fault for refusing to contribute in any way and for his manipulative behavior.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
- The author is grieving and feeling vulnerable, which can make emotions run high and expectations unclear.
- The boyfriend offered to stay with the author before the rave, but the author did not respond, possibly due to grief or doubting his sincerity.
- The boyfriend still went to the rave, which had been planned for a long time, but also helped sell the author's ticket and reached out again the next day.
- The author admits she could have communicated her needs more clearly.
- The boyfriend did make an effort to check in and offer support, even if it was last minute.
- There is no clear evidence of malice, neglect, or intentional hurt from either party; rather, there is a miscommunication and differing expectations during a difficult time.

**Conclusion:**  
This is a situation where grief, communication, and expectations intersect. Neither party is clearly at fault; both are navigating a tough situation as best they can. The boyfriend did not ignore the author, and the author’s feelings are understandable, but not the result of anyone’s wrongdoing. This is a case of miscommunication and emotional complexity, not fault.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Initial Situation:** The group chat is for an APUSH class. Someone asks for a picture of a completed assignment (implying a request to cheat). Some students object, saying that's cheating and not appropriate for the chat.

2. **Author's Actions:** The author jokes about cheating being better than discussion, and this is screenshotted by Ryan, who threatens to show the teacher.

3. **Escalation:** The author, feeling threatened, brings up Ryan's personal life (his cheating in a romantic relationship) in the group chat as a retort.

4. **Group Reaction:** The group says the author was unnecessarily rude.

5. **Fault Analysis:**
   - **Cheating:** Asking for assignment answers is academically dishonest, but this is a common (if problematic) group chat behavior.
   - **Ryan's Actions:** Reporting cheating is within his rights, though it may be seen as antagonistic.
   - **Author's Retort:** The author escalates the situation by making a personal attack, bringing up unrelated personal matters (Ryan's romantic life) in a public academic setting.

6. **Conclusion:** While multiple people are involved in questionable behavior (cheating, reporting, etc.), the author is specifically at fault for making a personal attack that was unrelated to the academic context and was perceived as unnecessarily rude by the group. The question is about whether the author's response was justified or out of line, and the consensus is that it was out of line.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author repeatedly tells his girlfriend she smells or needs to shower/change.
   - He tries to be indirect, but she gets upset and embarrassed.
   - He pushes for a conversation when she wants to drop it.
   - He says the situation is ""ridiculous,"" which she interprets as a personal attack.
   - He feels justified because he thinks it's reasonable to expect basic hygiene.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - **Girlfriend:** She may be sensitive about being told she smells, but that's a normal human reaction. She also may not have had other clothes, which she communicated.
   - **Author:** He repeatedly brings up the issue, even after she is clearly upset and asks to drop it. He escalates by insisting on ""clearing the air"" and calling the situation ""ridiculous,"" which is dismissive of her feelings. He also frames the issue as her being childish or irresponsible, which is patronizing.
   - **Communication:** The author’s approach is not empathetic. He focuses on his own discomfort and frames her reaction as unreasonable, rather than acknowledging her embarrassment and trying to find a supportive solution.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for how he handled the situation. While it's reasonable to want a partner to maintain hygiene, the way he communicated was insensitive and escalated the conflict. He did not respect her boundaries when she asked to drop the subject and made her feel worse by calling the situation ""ridiculous.""

- The author explained their mental health concerns and offered to pay the full rent, but the parents are insisting on a roommate, dismissing the author's concerns.
- The parents are not listening to the author's well-articulated and reasonable boundaries, and are minimizing the impact of past trauma and current mental health needs.
- The author is not at fault for wanting to protect their mental health, especially given their willingness to pay the full rent.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author feels mistreated by a teacher, who is described as rude and accusatory.
   - In response, the author creates memes mocking the teacher and helps run a meme page about her.
   - The author later learns about the teacher’s personal loss and feels some guilt, but continues the meme page, justifying it as a joke and a response to perceived mistreatment.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The teacher’s behavior may be unkind or unfair, but the question is about the morality of the author’s actions.
   - Creating and sharing memes that mock a specific teacher, especially in a public or semi-public forum, is a form of targeted ridicule or cyberbullying, regardless of the teacher’s behavior.
   - The author acknowledges feeling guilty after learning about the teacher’s loss, indicating awareness that the memes could be hurtful.
   - The justification that the memes are “just a joke” does not negate the potential harm or the intent to ridicule.

3. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The teacher may have acted poorly, but the specific question is about the morality of the author’s actions.
   - The author is at fault for continuing to run a meme page that targets and mocks a specific individual, especially after recognizing it could be hurtful.

4. **Conclusion:**

- The author chose to keep both Bulbasaurs for personal collection reasons, despite knowing how much it meant to their girlfriend.
- The author also danced and celebrated their luck in front of their girlfriend, who was having bad luck, which could be seen as insensitive.

Prioritizing a video game over answering the door or phone, especially when someone is doing you a favor, is inconsiderate.

- The author responded by questioning her self-respect, which is a judgmental and hurtful reaction.
- The author admits to losing respect for her based on something she did before they met, and for which she says she did not actually go through with anything.
- The author is considering bringing up the issue again, despite already apologizing and the girlfriend being upset.

While it's normal to have feelings and insecurities, the fault here lies in how the author handled the situation—by shaming and judging their partner for her past, rather than listening and supporting her.

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is in a difficult situation due to their brother's substance abuse and the girlfriend's rude behavior.
- The author has chosen to go no-contact with the brother for personal safety, which is a reasonable boundary.
- The girlfriend is described as being rude and disrespectful in the parents' home.
- The parents are tolerating the girlfriend's behavior out of concern for the brother's well-being, not because they approve of it.
- The brother is upset with the author for not being welcoming to the girlfriend, but the author is simply avoiding conflict rather than being actively hostile.
- The author is not escalating the situation and is trying to avoid confrontation.

Given these facts, the primary fault lies with the brother (for his substance abuse and for enabling/disregarding his girlfriend's behavior) and the girlfriend (for her disrespectful actions). The parents are in a tough spot but are not directly at fault for the rudeness. The author is not at fault for setting boundaries and choosing not to engage.

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Background**: The author describes a history of being bullied and mistreated by their older sister (MB), who has a pattern of antagonistic and aggressive behavior.

2. **Incident**: During a family gathering, MB mocks and provokes the author after the author calmly tells their younger sister not to kick someone. MB escalates the situation by threatening and physically attacking the author (swinging at them multiple times).

3. **Author's Response**: The author initially does not retaliate, but after being attacked a second time, restrains MB to prevent further harm. The author uses physical force only to restrain and stop the attack, not to inflict harm.

4. **Aftermath**: The author yells at MB out of frustration, telling her to ""go die or leave."" MB then reports the incident to their father, who blames the author.

5. **Fault Assessment**:
   - MB is the clear aggressor, initiating both verbal and physical attacks.
   - The author’s response is defensive and aimed at stopping the attack, not escalating it.
   - The author’s verbal outburst, while harsh, comes after repeated provocation and physical assault.
   - The father, who was not present, blames the author without considering the context or the author’s account.

6. **Conclusion**: The primary fault lies with MB for instigating and escalating the conflict, both verbally and physically. The father's reaction is also problematic, but the main issue is MB's behavior. The author’s actions are reasonable self-defense under the circumstances.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author's Position:** The author is not working due to legal restrictions, not by choice, and is using the time for personal growth, hobbies, and volunteering. She has communicated her boundaries clearly and discussed the situation with her husband, who supports her.

2. **Sister-in-law's Position:** The SIL is a struggling single mom who needs help with childcare. She may be under stress and is seeking support from family, which is understandable.

3. **Family's Position:** The family perceives the author as having free time and expects her to help, possibly out of a sense of familial duty. However, they are making assumptions about how the author spends her time and are not respecting her boundaries.

4. **Fault Analysis:** 
   - The author is not obligated to provide free childcare, especially when it is frequent and without proper notice.
   - The SIL and family are not necessarily ""at fault"" for asking for help, but they are at fault for not respecting the author's boundaries and for making negative assumptions about her.
   - However, the author has communicated her boundaries respectfully and is not being malicious or unreasonable.

5. **Conclusion:** This is a situation where needs and expectations are clashing, but no one is acting with clear malice or gross negligence. The author is within her rights to say no, and the family is within their rights to ask for help (though not to demand it or judge her harshly). The real issue is a mismatch of expectations and communication, not ""fault.""

**Therefore, nobody is truly at fault here.**",stop,652,337,989

I broke up with my ex after dating her for a month and a half. The reason...",Other,Nobody,0.95,1.0,True,"Confidence: 0.95  
Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author's Actions:**  
   - The author ended the relationship due to feeling manipulated and emotionally burdened, especially by threats of self-harm and guilt-tripping.  
   - After the breakup, the ex claimed to have cheated, then said she lied, then it turned out she had been assaulted (not consensual cheating).  
   - The author tried to cut off communication for their own well-being, encouraged the ex to seek professional help, and eventually blocked her after repeated, distressing messages.

2. **Ex's Actions:**  
   - The ex threatened self-harm and suicide to manipulate the author into staying in contact.  
   - She lied about cheating, then said she lied, then later revealed it was actually assault.  
   - She continued to contact the author after being asked not to, and blamed the author for her distress.

3. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The author is not at fault for ending a relationship that was emotionally harmful to them, nor for not knowing the full story when the ex initially lied and then changed her story.  
   - The ex is not at fault for being assaulted, but is at fault for manipulative behavior and dishonesty.  
   - The situation is tragic and complicated, but the author cannot be expected to know the truth when it was not communicated clearly, and is not responsible for the ex's mental health.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is not at fault for being upset or for cutting off contact, given the information and behavior presented.  
   - The ex is not at fault for being assaulted, but is responsible for her manipulative actions.  
   - However, the core issue (the assault) is not the fault of either party in the relationship context.

**Therefore, in the context of the question (""AITA for being mad at her, ignoring her, etc. when it turns out I didn't know the full story?""),**

Final Answer: Nobody

Step by step reasoning:
- The author feels hurt because they saw a social media post that made them think their friend was spending time with someone else on her birthday, despite saying she was with her mom.
- The friend explained the picture was old and that she was with her mom.
- The author admits to being half-joking, half-hurt in their confrontation, and the friend asked them to communicate directly rather than getting upset.
- There is a history of the author feeling left out on holidays and birthdays, but no clear evidence of intentional wrongdoing by the friend in this specific instance.
- The situation seems to be a misunderstanding and a result of miscommunication, not malice or clear fault.
- Both parties could have handled things differently, but there is no clear ""at fault"" party based on the information provided.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**
- The author (you) agreed to buy a calculator, but circumstances changed unexpectedly when a friend offered to lend you the exact calculator you needed, for free, for the duration you needed it.
- You notified the seller as soon as possible (1 hour before the meeting), apologized profusely, and explained the situation.
- While it is understandable that the seller is frustrated (he may have gone out of his way to get the calculator ready for you), his response was disproportionate and aggressive, including threats to ""expose"" you online and save your name and picture.
- Canceling a deal at short notice is inconsiderate, but not malicious or deserving of harassment or threats.
- The seller's behavior is inappropriate and crosses a line into intimidation and bullying.

**Conclusion:** The seller is at fault for their extreme and threatening reaction. While you could have given more notice if possible, your actions were reasonable given the circumstances, and you handled the situation with maturity and repeated apologies.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Initial Situation:**  
   The author has a very common email address and receives a lot of misdirected emails intended for other people with the same name. This is annoying and inconvenient, but not anyone's ""fault"" in a moral sense—it's a byproduct of having a common name and people making honest mistakes.

2. **Initial Response:**  
   The author tried to do the right thing by informing senders of the mistake. This is a reasonable and considerate response.

3. **Escalation:**  
   The author then escalates to ""messing with them"":  
   - Cancelling travel reservations, dental and beauty appointments  
   - Sending mean emails to colleagues  
   - Ordering things to their homes with a message  
   These actions are intentionally harmful and go far beyond any reasonable response to the inconvenience.

4. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The people giving the wrong email are making a mistake, but not acting maliciously.  
   - The author is intentionally causing harm and distress to people who, at worst, are careless with their email address.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   The author is at fault for their disproportionate and malicious response. The initial inconvenience does not justify the harmful actions taken.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault for not being honest about their feelings and for breaking up under false pretenses. While it is understandable to want to spare someone's feelings, leading someone on and then lying about the reason for a breakup is generally considered disrespectful to the other person's autonomy and emotional well-being. The author acknowledges feeling guilty for this, which suggests an awareness that their actions were not entirely fair. While telling the full, harsh truth can be unnecessarily hurtful, there are ways to end a relationship honestly and kindly without resorting to a fabricated excuse.

She explained she doesn't know how to cook those dishes, and you accepted her answer. There is no evidence of disrespect, coercion, or insensitivity beyond a casual suggestion.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **The Incident:**  
   - The author, after drinking, touched her girlfriend in a way that was not meant to be sexual but was unwelcome.
   - The girlfriend asked her to stop, and the author immediately did.
   - The next day, the girlfriend expressed that the incident was triggering due to past trauma.
   - The author apologized multiple times, expressed understanding, and offered to talk or give space.

2. **Aftermath:**  
   - The girlfriend remained upset, withdrawn, and angry the next morning.
   - The author became frustrated with the ongoing tension, especially as it affected their morning routine and commute.
   - The author is now questioning whether her girlfriend’s reaction is about the incident or about wanting to revert to a more unequal, coddling dynamic in the relationship.

3. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - **Author:** She made a mistake by touching her girlfriend in a way that was unwelcome, but she stopped immediately when asked and apologized sincerely. She did not intend harm, and her actions after the fact were appropriate and respectful.
   - **Girlfriend:** She is entitled to her feelings and reactions, especially given her trauma history. She communicated her discomfort and is processing the event in her own way.
   - **Relationship Dynamics:** The author is struggling with the emotional labor and balance in the relationship, but this is a broader issue, not directly about fault in this specific incident.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - There is no clear ""fault"" here. The author made a minor, non-malicious mistake and handled it as well as possible after the fact. The girlfriend is processing a trigger, which is not her fault. The emotional complexity and frustration are understandable on both sides, but neither party is acting maliciously or unreasonably.
   - The author’s questioning of the situation is a normal part of processing a difficult emotional event and does not make her an ""asshole"" or at fault.

This is a difficult, emotionally charged situation with no clear wrongdoing. Both parties are doing their best to navigate trauma, boundaries, and relationship dynamics.

She also dismisses your need for professional help and tries to control how and to whom you open up. These behaviors are emotionally neglectful and controlling.

Both parties contributed to the conflict. The boyfriend was tired and moody, which led to him being rude and dismissive, especially after being woken up and during arguments. He also made a personal dig about exercise, which was unkind and unnecessary. On the other hand, the author, while trying to be understanding, still expressed disappointment and brought up feeling bored and lonely, which—though valid—may have contributed to escalating the argument, especially given the boyfriend's tired state.

Final Answer: Author

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Background and Context:**  
   The author has experienced significant trauma and hardship, and H was a supportive friend during high school. After high school, their lives diverged: H became busier with college, work, and new friends, while the author faced instability and new relationships.

2. **Conflict Points:**  
   - The author felt abandoned as H spent less time with her, but H explained it was due to school and work.
   - H expressed concern about the author’s new relationship, possibly out of care, but did so in a way that upset the author.
   - The author moved further away and expected H to visit, but H cited distance and gas money as obstacles. The author took this personally and insulted H.
   - The author expected H to support her through multiple pregnancy scares, but H was not present.
   - When the author asked H to be her Maid of Honor, H declined, citing feeling taken advantage of and that the author focused only on her own problems.

3. **Analysis of Fault:**  
   - H’s actions (setting boundaries, being honest about her feelings, and declining the MOH role) are reasonable, especially if she felt the friendship was one-sided or emotionally draining.
   - The author repeatedly expected H to prioritize her needs, became angry when H did not, and insulted her. The author also minimized H’s feelings and contributions, focusing on the monetary value rather than the emotional labor or boundaries H was trying to set.
   - The author’s fiancé’s opinion is biased, while a mutual friend agreed with H, suggesting the author’s behavior is the issue.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   While H could have communicated more gently at times, the main pattern is the author expecting more from H than is reasonable, not respecting boundaries, and reacting with anger and insults when disappointed. The author’s own narrative shows a lack of empathy for H’s perspective.

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Monica** is at fault to some degree for ""stringing Joey along"" for months, knowing he has feelings for her, and not being direct about her lack of romantic interest. This has prolonged Joey's confusion and pain.

2. **Joey** is at fault for not communicating his feelings directly to Monica and for being in denial about the situation, despite being told the truth by the author. He is also projecting a relationship that doesn't exist.

3. **The Author** is at fault for not following through on the ultimatum and for continuing to delay resolution, which prolongs the awkwardness and pain for everyone involved. While the author has been transparent, the indecision and lack of action after the ultimatum contribute to the ongoing problem.

4. **Summary**: All three parties have contributed to the situation through lack of direct communication, avoidance, or indecision. While the author is not ""the asshole"" for wanting to move on, everyone shares some responsibility for the messiness of the situation.

**Reasoning:**
- You communicated your constraints (illness, finals) and did your best to contribute, editing the proposal and providing a draft as soon as you could.
- Your group members were frustrated, likely because they felt you weren't contributing equally, but their communication was harsh and unsupportive.
- You took responsibility by choosing to do the project alone, with the professor's approval, and did not sabotage the group's work (you removed your own contributions only).
- Group projects are often stressful, especially with uneven workloads and external pressures (illness, exams).
- There is no clear malicious intent or gross negligence from either side; rather, it's a case of miscommunication, mismatched expectations, and unfortunate timing.

   The author (ME) engaged in an online argument about a controversial topic. The conversation escalated, and both parties exchanged insults, including racist language. The author used the n-word in a comment, which was screenshotted and sent to school authorities, leading to disciplinary action.

2. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The author admits to using a racial slur (""I want to call you a [n-word-hard-r], but if you even were one, you'd be too white for the title."").  
   - The instigator (IR) also used a racial stereotype (""lmao shut up you taco eating Mexican."").  
   - The school is responding to the author's comment, not the instigator's, because only the author's comment was reported.

3. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The author is at fault for using a racial slur, which is universally recognized as unacceptable and punishable in most school and social contexts.
   - The instigator is also at fault for using a racist insult.
   - The person who reported only the author's comment (and not the full context) may have contributed to an incomplete picture, but the author's action stands on its own as a violation.
   - The school is following standard procedure in response to a racist comment.

4. **Who is MOST at fault?**  
   - The author is directly responsible for their own words and actions, regardless of provocation.
   - While the instigator is also at fault, the question is about the author's situation and disciplinary consequences.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for using a racial slur, which is the primary reason for the disciplinary action.

Physical violence, especially from a parent to a child, is a serious escalation and is not an appropriate or acceptable response to being talked back to, regardless of the provocation.

- She responded by calling you a rude name and complaining to her friends.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author and their family play 20 Questions with strict rules.
   - The author chose ""intestines"" as their answer.
   - The brother guessed ""stomach"" (close, but not correct), and the author encouraged him to keep guessing.
   - The brother then guessed ""anus"" (not correct either).
   - When the author revealed ""intestines,"" the brother got upset, feeling he was close enough.
   - The family mostly sided with the brother, but the author refused to admit he was right, called him a ""loser,"" and told him to ""go and cry somewhere else.""

2. **Fault Analysis:**
   - **Game Rules:** The rules seem to require specificity. ""Stomach"" and ""anus"" are not the same as ""intestines,"" so technically, the brother was not correct.
   - **Social Dynamics:** The author escalated the situation by calling the brother names and dismissing his feelings, even after the rest of the family agreed with the brother.
   - **Resolution:** The main issue is not the technicality of the game, but the author's reaction—refusing to admit any fault and resorting to insults.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - While the brother may have been frustrated, the author is at fault for their dismissive and insulting behavior, which is unnecessary and escalated the conflict. The technicality of the game is less important than the way the author handled the disagreement.

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Primary Issue:** The core issue is that the mother-in-law (MIL) and father-in-law (FIL) repeatedly violated clear parental boundaries regarding the safety of your daughter, specifically about her being around the brother-in-law (BIL) who is actively using heroin.

2. **Parental Rights:** As parents, you and your husband have the right and responsibility to set boundaries to protect your child, especially from exposure to drug use, unpredictable behavior, and emotionally volatile situations.

3. **Repeated Boundary Violations:** Despite being told multiple times not to have your daughter around BIL, MIL (and to a lesser extent FIL) repeatedly ignored or circumvented your wishes, sometimes lying or omitting the truth about BIL’s presence.

4. **Manipulation and Dishonesty:** MIL lied about FIL’s presence at the mall, indicating she understood the rule but chose to manipulate the situation. FIL also failed to clarify the arrangement, and only after the fact did he admit the truth.

5. **Your Actions:** You gave multiple chances, set clear conditions, and only after repeated violations did you enforce a strict boundary. You still allow supervised visits, so you are not cutting off the grandparents entirely.

6. **Husband’s Role:** While your husband is less concerned and sometimes minimizes the issue, he does agree to your boundaries when pressed. The main violations are by MIL and FIL.

7. **Guilt and Bias:** You acknowledge your bias and guilt, but the facts show your actions are based on repeated, serious breaches of trust and concern for your daughter’s safety.

8. **Conclusion:** The people at fault are MIL and FIL for repeatedly violating your boundaries and lying about it. You are not at fault for protecting your child, even if you have personal misgivings about MIL.

You are not the asshole. The fault lies with MIL and FIL for disregarding your explicit instructions and putting your daughter in potentially unsafe situations. Your actions are reasonable and responsible given the circumstances.",stop,1479,425,1904

**Reasoning:**  
The grandparents are at fault here. It is a basic expectation of privacy to be allowed to change clothes without being barged in on, regardless of age or family hierarchy. The author has communicated their need for privacy and asked for a moment to get dressed, which is a reasonable and respectful request. The grandparents, especially the grandmother, are disregarding this boundary and then accusing the author of disrespect when the author asserts their need for privacy. Yelling is not ideal, but it is a reaction to repeated boundary violations after reasonable requests have been ignored.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Agreement and Honesty:** The author explicitly agreed to stop watching porn as a condition of the relationship, knowing it was important to his girlfriend due to her past trauma and personal boundaries.

2. **Breach of Trust:** Despite this agreement, the author continued to watch porn and hid it from his girlfriend, violating her trust and the terms of their relationship.

3. **Minimizing Her Feelings:** The author repeatedly dismisses his girlfriend’s feelings and boundaries as “ridiculous” and “stupid,” showing a lack of empathy for her trauma and the reasons behind her request.

4. **Responsibility:** While everyone has the right to their own boundaries and preferences, the author had the option to decline the relationship if he felt her boundaries were unreasonable for him. Instead, he agreed and then broke that agreement.

5. **Fault:** The girlfriend is not at fault for enforcing her boundaries, especially after being clear about them and her reasons. The author is at fault for agreeing to those boundaries, breaking them, and then blaming her for being upset.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**
- The author borrowed the cousin's phone and lost it due to the string breaking. When you borrow something, you are generally responsible for its care, and if it is lost or damaged, it is reasonable to expect to compensate the owner.
- The author acknowledges this and offers to pay for a replacement, but only up to the value of the lost phone, not a more expensive model.
- The cousin is pushing for a more expensive replacement (iPhone X), but the author is correct in only owing the value of the lost item, not an upgrade.
- The author is also correct in not wanting to involve their parents in the repayment.
- However, the author expresses frustration at the cousin for making the situation tense, but the tension is a natural consequence of the loss and the repayment process.

**Conclusion:**  
The author is at fault for losing the phone and is responsible for replacing it with a phone of similar value. The cousin is not entitled to an upgrade, but the author is responsible for the loss. The family’s involvement and the cousin’s demands for an upgrade are not justified, but the core fault for the loss lies with the author.",stop,510,249,759

**Reasoning:**
- The author allowed a close female friend (with whom he has a history of cheating/making out, even if years ago) to sleep over at his place, knowing his current girlfriend is uncomfortable with this specific friend.
- While the act of letting a friend crash is not inherently wrong, the context (past romantic/sexual involvement, history of cheating, girlfriend's clear discomfort) makes this a boundary issue in the current relationship.
- The author did inform his girlfriend, but only after agreeing to the sleepover, and did not prioritize her feelings or discuss boundaries beforehand.
- The girlfriend's feelings are understandable given the history, and the author could have handled the situation with more sensitivity or found an alternative solution.
- Therefore, the author is primarily at fault for not respecting relationship boundaries and for not addressing his girlfriend's concerns proactively.",stop,653,183,836

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The mother asked a racially insensitive and awkward question to a guest (""What color of boys do you like?"").
   - When called out, she doubled down, became defensive, and later denied her words.
   - The author and brother tried to explain why her comments were inappropriate.
   - The mother has a history of making fetishizing comments about people of color.
   - The author wonders if they handled the situation poorly and if they are at fault.

2. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The mother is the one who made the inappropriate comments and then became defensive and dismissive when called out.
   - The author and brother attempted to address the issue, albeit with some tension.
   - The brother may have been blunt, but the core issue is the mother's behavior.
   - The author is reflecting on their own actions, but there is no evidence they were at fault for the situation itself.

3. **Analysis:**  
   - The author is not at fault for the mother's comments or her reaction.
   - The brother's bluntness may have escalated things, but the root cause is the mother's insensitivity and defensiveness.
   - The friend is not at fault.
   - The mother is the primary person at fault for making inappropriate, racially insensitive, and fetishizing comments, and for refusing to listen to feedback.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The mother (Other) is at fault for the situation. The author is not the asshole.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author (you) is not at fault for feeling upset or conflicted; it's natural to want a special celebration for your first child.
- The cousin is not at fault for suggesting a combined party; it seems practical and inclusive, especially with family traveling and a reunion planned.
- There is no evidence of malice, neglect, or unreasonable behavior from either side.
- This is a situation of overlapping plans and differing expectations, not wrongdoing.
- Both parties are communicating and trying to find a solution.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The child swore in their own home, in a context where the parents have established that this is acceptable.
- The swearing was not directed at anyone, nor was it used in anger or as an insult.
- The brother-in-law's in-laws were unintentionally exposed to the swearing via Facetime, but this was accidental and not malicious.
- The author apologized when asked, but was uncomfortable making a direct call to strangers, especially given their anxiety and the fact that they had never met these people.
- The brother-in-law and his wife escalated the situation by insisting on a direct call, which seems disproportionate to the accidental and minor nature of the incident.
- No one acted with clear malice or intent to offend; the situation arose from a combination of different household norms and an accident.

Therefore, while feelings were hurt, there is no clear ""fault"" in the sense of someone behaving unreasonably or maliciously. This is a clash of expectations and social norms, not a case of someone being truly at fault.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is expressing concern for the health and safety of their hypothetical future child, given that their cousins are unvaccinated. This is a reasonable and responsible concern, especially for infants who are not yet fully vaccinated and are therefore vulnerable to preventable diseases.
- The grandparents and aunts are making decisions for their own children based on their beliefs, even if those beliefs are not supported by science. While this is problematic from a public health perspective, they are acting according to their convictions and not directly harming the author.
- The parents of the author are offering their opinion, suggesting that the author is being too extreme, but they are not forcing any action or preventing the author from making their own choices.
- No one in this situation is directly harming another; everyone is expressing their own beliefs and intentions. The author is not at fault for wanting to protect their future child, and the other family members are not at fault for having a discussion about it.
- The situation is hypothetical (no child yet), and no action has been taken that would cause harm or offense.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**
- The author clearly communicated their limitations and intentions in advance, citing a major, career-defining exam as the reason for not being able to celebrate their girlfriend's birthday in a big way.
- The girlfriend, who was in the same situation (same year, same exam), initially agreed and expressed understanding.
- The author did not ignore or forget the birthday; they got a cake and card as promised, and planned to celebrate after exams.
- The girlfriend later expressed deep hurt, but she had not previously communicated how important birthdays were to her, nor did she object to the arrangement at the time.
- The author responded to her distress with empathy and effort, even under immense pressure.
- The breakup was influenced by this incident, but it seems to stem from a mismatch in expectations and communication, not from malice or neglect.

**Conclusion:**  
This is a situation where both parties acted in good faith but had a misalignment in emotional needs and communication. There was no clear wrongdoing or malice; rather, it was a case of unfortunate misunderstanding and differing priorities under stress. Therefore, nobody is truly ""at fault.""",stop,705,242,947

- The author acknowledges that their husband is upset about not being consulted and that they spent a lot of money.
- The author admits to being influenced by emotions and possibly by the store manager's tactics.
- While the author acted out of compassion, making a unilateral decision that affects both partners in a household (especially regarding a pet) is generally inconsiderate.
- The husband's reaction, while perhaps strong, is understandable given the circumstances.

Step by step reasoning:
- The author brought up a sensitive topic with good intentions, but it clearly upset her boyfriend. While her intent was supportive, mentioning his past trauma may have triggered him, so some sensitivity was lacking.
- The boyfriend reacted with anger, which is understandable if he felt hurt, but he did not communicate his feelings constructively and instead became ""pissy.""
- The author then ignored him for a few days, which is not a healthy way to resolve conflict and likely escalated the situation.
- The boyfriend responded by flirting with other girls and being a ""bad boyfriend"" to provoke a breakup, which is manipulative and immature.
- Both parties contributed to the breakdown in communication and escalation of the conflict.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
This is a classic case of a difficult but understandable disagreement between partners, not a situation where anyone is clearly ""at fault."" The author is not at fault for having concerns about the practical implications of sharing the exact same name, especially given the potential for confusion in daily life and with future children. The fiance is also not at fault for wanting to change her last name to something easier and to escape the frustration of her current last name. Both perspectives are valid and rooted in personal experience and practical concerns.

The author is not suggesting forbidding her fiance from changing her name, but rather expressing a desire to have an open conversation about the potential downsides. Wanting to discuss this further or take a stronger stance is not inherently wrong or selfish; it's a reasonable part of navigating a shared future. The fiance's frustration is also understandable, given her lifelong experience with her last name.

Ultimately, this is a matter for mutual discussion and compromise, not blame. No one is acting maliciously or unreasonably. Therefore, nobody is at fault.",stop,578,225,803

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author’s perspective:** The author has a long-standing, well-communicated anxiety about being in other people’s houses. They have been upfront about this with everyone, including their best friend, and have made efforts to accommodate socializing in other ways. The author is not refusing to see their friend or be part of their life, just not in the friend’s house.

2. **Friend’s perspective:** The friend feels hurt and possibly rejected by the author’s refusal to come to her house, especially since she perceives the author has made exceptions for others (e.g., a boyfriend). She wants reciprocity in the friendship and feels the author isn’t willing to “work on it” for her.

3. **Fault analysis:**  
   - The author is not at fault for having an anxiety they cannot control, especially since they are open about it and make efforts to maintain the friendship in other ways.
   - The friend is not necessarily at fault for feeling hurt or wanting reciprocity, but it is unreasonable to expect someone to “work on” a deep-seated anxiety just for her, especially when it’s not targeted at her personally.
   - There is no malice or ill intent on either side; it’s a clash of needs and expectations.

4. **Conclusion:** This is a situation where neither party is truly at fault. The author is managing their anxiety as best they can, and the friend is expressing her feelings. It’s an unfortunate incompatibility, not a case of wrongdoing.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author describes a situation where an ex-worker, who has a history of manipulative behavior, tries to hug them at work before opening hours.
- The author sets a clear boundary by saying ""No. Don’t hug me."" and then clarifies, perhaps harshly, ""Because we aren’t friends.""
- The ex-worker is hurt by this, but the author is within their rights to refuse physical contact, especially given the context and their feelings about the ex-worker's past actions.
- The ex-worker's previous behavior (lying about emergencies, taking things without permission, etc.) may justify the author's lack of warmth, but the immediate situation is about personal boundaries.
- The author’s response may have been blunt, but setting boundaries is not inherently ""at fault,"" even if it hurts someone's feelings.
- There is no clear wrongdoing that rises to the level of ""fault"" in a moral or ethical sense in this specific interaction.

- The author is being considerate of the sister's feelings and is not acting maliciously.
- There is no clear wrongdoing or malice from either party; it's a situation of conflicting feelings and expectations.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Assessing the Author's Actions:**  
   - The author received a message from someone threatening suicide.
   - The author tried to help, encouraged the person to seek help, and only called emergency services when the situation escalated (slurred speech, mention of pills, etc.).
   - The author did not have much information to give, but did their best to provide what they could.
   - The author was motivated by concern for another person's safety, not malice or attention-seeking.

2. **Assessing the Other Parties:**
   - The person making the threats may have been in genuine distress or may have been seeking attention, but the author had no way to know for sure.
   - The police were somewhat dismissive, but they did follow up and try to help.
   - The parents were concerned, but their reaction was not unreasonable given the situation.

3. **Fault Analysis:**
   - The author acted responsibly and with compassion, following the general advice for such situations: take threats seriously and contact authorities if someone may be in immediate danger.
   - The police and parents may have been less than supportive, but their actions do not rise to the level of ""fault"" in a moral sense; they were responding to a stressful and confusing situation.
   - The person making the threats may have caused distress, but if they were in genuine crisis, they are not ""at fault"" for needing help.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - No one in this situation is truly ""at fault."" The author did the right thing, and the others were responding as best they could under the circumstances. The situation is unfortunate, but not the result of anyone's wrongdoing.

- When the author explains the necessity of the tea for their health, the stepmom insists on sharing, disregarding the medical need.
- The author expresses their upset and then withdraws from the conversation after being called rude.
- The conflict arises because the stepmom does not respect the author’s medical need and limited supply, prioritizing a general principle of sharing over a specific health requirement.

- The author then cut ties.

Fault analysis:
- The author was honest about his feelings and asked for clarification, which is reasonable, though perhaps a bit persistent.
- The girl was not obligated to continue the conversation, but her response was blunt.

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author describes a situation where a close friend made extremely cruel and violent remarks about a transgender speaker.
- The author is considering distancing themselves from this friend because of those remarks.
- The question is whether the author would be ""the asshole"" (WIBTA) for avoiding the friend.
- The friend is the one who made hateful, violent comments, which is clearly wrong and harmful.
- The author is not at fault for being disturbed by this and considering ending the friendship.

Final Answer: Author

Step by step reasoning:
- The author developed feelings for someone who was already in a relationship. This is not inherently wrong.
- Upon learning she had a boyfriend, the author reduced contact, which is a respectful choice.
- The author then went to the boyfriend and threatened him (""You break her heart, I break your bones!!""). This is a form of intimidation and is inappropriate, regardless of intentions.
- The woman later found out about the threat and was upset, cutting contact with the author.
- The author is questioning whether their actions were wrong.

The key issue is the threat made to the boyfriend. This is an overstep and constitutes inappropriate behavior. The boyfriend did not deserve to be threatened, and the woman is justified in being upset upon learning about it. The author is at fault for this action.",stop,327,175,502

Final Answer: Nobody

Step by step reasoning:
- The author (you) reacted strongly to a very upsetting and inappropriate comment about animal cruelty.
- The mom's boyfriend repeated what his friend said, and seemed to find it amusing, which is insensitive, but he was not the original source of the cruel idea.
- The friend (not present) is the one who made the original, disturbing comment.
- The author yelled in response, which is understandable given the context and their love for cats.
- The boyfriend apologized, though the sincerity is in question.
- The situation is emotionally charged, but the author is not at fault for reacting strongly to a comment about animal cruelty.
- The boyfriend's behavior was insensitive, but he did not directly threaten harm.
- The real fault lies with the friend who made the original comment, but they are not present in this interaction.

Given the context, nobody in the immediate conversation is truly ""at fault"" in a way that would make the author an ""asshole."" The author’s reaction is justified, and the boyfriend’s comment was insensitive but not directly harmful.

**Reasoning:**  
The author is not at fault for expressing financial concerns and feeling upset about being told (not asked) to contribute to Christmas dinner, especially given their limited budget as a university student.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author was invited to hang out and found their friends very drunk, with one in a concerning state.
- The author took responsible actions: helped the friend to the bathroom, monitored their responsiveness, called healthcare professionals for advice, and followed their instructions.
- The author checked on the more impaired friend multiple times, ensured both were in a safe sleeping position, and left water and a garbage can nearby.
- The author felt guilty for leaving but also recognized limits to their responsibility.
- The friends are responsible for their own drinking, but the author did not enable or encourage their overconsumption.
- The author sought expert advice and followed it, which is a reasonable standard of care for a non-medical person.
- There is no evidence of neglect or malice from anyone involved.

**Reasoning:**  
In this situation, nobody is clearly at fault. The author is dealing with the emotional aftermath of a divorce and is honest about her lack of connection with her ex-stepdaughter, despite her best efforts. She is not being cruel or malicious; rather, she is trying to gently distance herself to protect her own emotional well-being. The ex-stepdaughter is also not at fault—she is simply reaching out to someone she cares about. There is no evidence of wrongdoing, neglect, or malice on either side.

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Blow drying at 9am**: While 9am is not objectively ""early"" in a college setting, your sleep disorder complicates things. However, your roommate is not being unreasonable using a hair dryer at that time in her own room. Ideally, she could use the bathroom, but it's not strictly her fault.

2. **Opening blinds at 11:45am**: Again, this is late morning, and it's reasonable for her to want natural light in the shared space. She could be more considerate, but it's not strictly her fault.

3. **Light usage double standard**: Here, your roommate is at fault for expecting you to be quiet/dark when she sleeps, but not reciprocating. However, you also acknowledge that you sometimes need light at odd hours. This is a classic shared-space conflict, and both of you could communicate and compromise better.

4. **Trash**: If you don't use the trash, it's unfair for her to expect you to take it out every time. But in a shared space, sometimes chores are split regardless of who generates the mess. This is a minor but common roommate issue.

**Summary**: Both you and your roommate have valid points and are also being a bit inflexible. Most of these issues stem from a lack of communication and compromise, which is common among new roommates. Neither of you is entirely at fault; both could be more considerate and communicate better.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**
- The main issue centers on the company director (your boyfriend’s boss) and his conduct during the interview and feedback process. His comments were unprofessional, dismissive, and unnecessarily personal, especially referencing your mental health and relationship in a negative way. This is inappropriate in a professional setting and would understandably make you feel hurt and judged.
- Your boyfriend is not directly at fault; he supported you by recommending you and was not involved in the hiring decision or the way you were treated.
- You (the author) are not at fault for feeling hurt or for deciding to distance yourself from your boyfriend’s work environment after being treated poorly.
- The only questionable action from your boyfriend is his reluctance to stand up for you, but this is more about his own job security and not the root cause of the problem.
- The primary fault lies with the company director for his unprofessional and insensitive behavior.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- You (the author) were transparent about the costs and asked everyone to pitch in, regardless of whether they were staying overnight, to help cover the rental fee for the group event.
- The couple initially agreed but later felt it was unfair since they were not staying overnight and were also bringing gifts/food.
- You offered a compromise by reducing their fee, showing flexibility.
- The couple is now discussing the payment with others, which may cause some group tension, but this is more about group dynamics and communication than clear fault.
- There is no evidence of malicious intent or clear wrongdoing from any party; this is a common social situation with differing expectations.
- Ultimately, this is a matter of differing perspectives on fairness, not a clear-cut case of fault.

Hu...",Author,Nobody,0.9,0.8571428571428571,True,"Confidence: 0.9

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Parents' Role:** The parents (grandparents) provided years of free childcare, which was a significant help and a generous gift. When the mother’s health declined, she was no longer able to provide care. This is a legitimate and unavoidable reason to stop, and she even tried to help by suggesting alternatives.

2. **Author's Role:** The author made a major life decision (moving, buying a more expensive house) based on the arrangement with the parents, but did so after repeatedly confirming with them that they were willing to continue. The author is understandably upset by the sudden change, but also acknowledges that the parents’ health comes first and that they are grateful for the help received.

3. **Communication:** There was a breakdown in communication and understanding about the financial and logistical impact of the change, but not a malicious or negligent act by either party.

4. **Financial Help:** The author feels the parents should offer financial help, but the parents may not realize the extent of the hardship, or may not feel obligated to provide ongoing financial support. There is no evidence of a promise or agreement for financial support.

5. **Fault:** No one acted with malice or irresponsibility. The situation is unfortunate and stressful, but it is the result of unforeseen health issues and perhaps some miscommunication or mismatched expectations, not anyone’s fault in a moral or ethical sense.

Therefore, while the author’s frustration is understandable, and the parents could perhaps be more empathetic, nobody is truly “at fault” in a way that warrants blame.

Final Answer: Everybody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Teacher's Actions:**
   - The teacher bumped up grades for college reporting, which is a questionable practice but not directly related to the main conflict.
   - The teacher gave instructions about due dates, but there was confusion, possibly due to unclear communication.
   - The teacher made an inappropriate and insensitive comment about your grandmother being in the hospital, which is unprofessional and wrong.
   - The teacher held you responsible for the assignment despite the substitute giving conflicting instructions.

2. **Substitute's Actions:**
   - The substitute gave incorrect instructions about the due dates, contributing to the confusion.

3. **Student's Actions (You and Friends):**
   - You followed the substitute's instructions, which is reasonable.
   - You participated in making a video that poked fun at teachers, including your Italian teacher. While you claim you were against including her scene, you were still involved in the project and its distribution.
   - Your friend who suggested the scene took credit, but the teacher is upset with you, possibly because you are the more visible participant or the one who shared it.

4. **Friends' Actions:**
   - Your friend pushed for the inclusion of the scene about the teacher and took credit for it, but you are bearing the brunt of the teacher's anger.

**Conclusion:**
- The teacher is at fault for insensitive comments and possibly unclear communication.
- The substitute is at fault for giving incorrect instructions.
- You and your friends are at fault for making and sharing a video that could be seen as disrespectful to staff, even if it was meant as a joke.
- The situation is a result of miscommunication, poor judgment, and insensitivity on multiple sides.

- There was no explicit agreement for him to come over at a specific time on Sunday, and you told him not to come when he first texted.
- Falling asleep after a long day, especially when you had no confirmation he was coming, is reasonable.
- N showing up unannounced and not confirming is inconsiderate, but not malicious.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Initial Agreement and Communication:**  
   - You asked your roommate (A) in advance if your friends could visit and if anyone could sleep in his room.  
   - He initially said he was thinking about it, but did not give a clear answer.

2. **Follow-up and Explicit Refusal:**  
   - On Wednesday, you asked again, and he *explicitly* said no: his room was not prepared, and he did not want anyone sleeping in his bed/room.

3. **Roommate’s Preferences and Boundaries:**  
   - You acknowledge that you know about his strong feelings regarding guests and cleanliness, and that he has a history of declining visits if the apartment is not clean.

4. **Your Actions:**  
   - Despite his explicit refusal, you allowed two guests to sleep in his room/bed.
   - You justify this by saying he took too long to decide, but he did give you a clear answer before your friends arrived.

5. **Aftermath:**  
   - He is upset, feels his boundaries and trust were violated, and you are in a fight.

**Conclusion:**  
- Your roommate set a clear boundary (no one in his room/bed), and you knowingly violated it.
- While his indecision and lack of help with cleaning are frustrating, they do not justify disregarding his explicit wishes about his private space.

**Reasoning:**  
Your dad is acting out of concern for your well-being and sleep, and as the person paying for the WiFi, he has some authority over its use in the household. While his motivations may be mixed (concern and disapproval of your PC), his actions are not unreasonable—turning off WiFi at 10-11pm is a common parental boundary. You are understandably frustrated, especially since you bought the PC yourself and feel targeted, but being ""mad"" at him for this boundary is a normal emotional response, not a moral failing.

While it's understandable to feel a sense of ownership or pride over the army you've invested time and money into, it's not reasonable to expect your friend to avoid collecting the same army just because you play it. Warhammer 40,000 is a hobby where people are free to choose whatever faction they like, and your friend has every right to collect Imperial Guard if that's what interests him. Wanting to restrict his choice because you feel slighted or want more variety is ultimately selfish, as you yourself acknowledge.

The author (the person writing the post) is primarily at fault here. While it’s understandable to feel uncomfortable or even slighted by the friend's father's comment (""I hope you're looking after her""), the author’s response (""well yes, I hope you look after your wife also?"") was unnecessarily confrontational and escalated the situation. The father's comment may have been awkward or old-fashioned, but it was not overtly hostile. The author’s retort, however, was pointed and made the situation more uncomfortable for everyone, including their girlfriend.

While the girlfriend could have introduced the author, the author acknowledges her social anxiety and does not blame her.

- The friend chose to remain friends, indicating he could handle it.
- The author is not responsible for the friend's feelings if she has been upfront and respectful.
- The brother and father’s perspective is based on a stereotype (“that’s just how guys are”) and places unfair responsibility on the author for someone else’s emotions and actions.

- In shared entertainment spaces like comedy clubs, it is generally expected that audience members do not talk during performances, as it is disrespectful to both the performer and other attendees.
- The author’s request was reasonable and polite, and the group’s behavior was inconsiderate.

When she asked you to pass her more food, you filled her plate to overflowing, which was a passive-aggressive gesture. This was done in front of family and other guests.

3. **Reaction**: Your girlfriend felt humiliated and said you came off as a controlling jerk. The public nature of your action made it worse, as it drew attention from everyone at the table.

4. **Fault Analysis**:
   - Your girlfriend did break your mutual agreement, but it was a special occasion (a wedding), and she did not make a scene or force you to break your diet.
   - Your response was public, passive-aggressive, and humiliating. Instead of addressing the issue privately or with empathy, you chose to make a point in a way that embarrassed her in front of others.

5. **Conclusion**: While your girlfriend may have slipped on your agreed diet, your reaction was disproportionate and inappropriate, especially given the public setting. The main fault lies with you for how you handled the situation.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author made a joke referencing a team as ""disabled,"" which is a term that can be offensive when used as an insult or to denote inferiority.
- Another person, who is disabled, was offended and responded negatively.
- The author responded with more ""edgy jokes"" and told the person they ""have a problem,"" escalating the situation.
- The other person insulted the author and blocked them.
- The author justifies their behavior by mentioning their own disability and their own way of coping with it.

While both parties exchanged insults, the initial fault lies with the author for making a joke that uses ""disabled"" as a pejorative, which is widely considered offensive regardless of the author's own disability status. The escalation and further insults from both sides are not ideal, but the author initiated the problematic behavior and continued it.

&gt...",Other,Nobody,0.95,0.875,True,"Let's break down the situation step by step:

**Summary of the situation:**
- The author and their husband have bird feeders on their apartment property, with management's permission.
- Their cats are calmer because of the bird feeders.
- A neighbor is upset because birds (attracted by the feeders) are pooping on his car, which he parks under a tree near the feeders.
- There is unassigned parking, and the neighbor could park elsewhere but chooses not to.
- The neighbor is now acting hostile, watching the author from his balcony.
- The author is asking if they are at fault (AITA).

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1. **Permission:** The author has explicit permission from the apartment management to have bird feeders.
2. **Neighbor's choice:** The neighbor chooses to park under a tree where birds congregate, despite other parking options.
3. **Impact:** The main negative impact is bird droppings on the neighbor's car, which is a foreseeable risk when parking under trees, especially in a wooded area.
4. **Reasonableness:** The author is not violating any rules, and the neighbor could mitigate the issue by parking elsewhere.
5. **Hostility:** The neighbor's hostile behavior (watching the author) is not justified by the situation.

**Fault assessment:**
- The author is acting within the rules and has management's support.
- The neighbor is choosing to park in a problematic spot and is blaming the author for a natural consequence of that choice.
- The situation is not the author's fault.

**Confidence Level:** Very high, as the facts are clear and the author has management's support.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author’s Behavior:**  
   - The author is not being overtly rude, starting fights, or causing drama.
   - The author is setting boundaries (not sharing food, not pretending to like Bubbles, avoiding him).
   - The author is not badmouthing Bubbles beyond explaining to the little brother why she doesn’t like him.

2. **Bubbles’ Behavior:**  
   - Bubbles is described as rude, two-faced, and intentionally provocative.
   - He escalated a breakup, laughed at the author’s distress, and continues to make inappropriate jokes.

3. **Other Parties (Boyfriend, Best Friend, Little Brother):**  
   - They are pressuring the author to tolerate Bubbles’ behavior because he’s “just a kid.”
   - They are not addressing Bubbles’ inappropriate actions.

4. **Fault Assessment:**  
   - The author is not obligated to like or pretend to like someone who is consistently rude and disrespectful.
   - The author is not escalating the situation or retaliating, just setting boundaries.
   - Bubbles is behaving poorly, but he is also a young teenager, and some immaturity is expected.
   - The boyfriend and others are minimizing the author’s feelings, but this is a common dynamic in group living situations.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - No one is *truly* at fault in a way that warrants blame. The author is handling things maturely, Bubbles is acting his age (albeit annoyingly), and the others are just trying to keep the peace.
   - This is a situation of clashing personalities and boundaries, not malice or serious wrongdoing.

**Reasoning:**
- The author is in a serious relationship and has a history of lying and cheating, which has already damaged trust with their current girlfriend.
- Despite knowing their girlfriend is uncomfortable with the close friendship with the ex (especially discussing private matters), the author continues to do so and dismisses the girlfriend's feelings as ""melodramatic and childish.""
- The author is not respecting reasonable boundaries requested by their partner, especially given the context of past dishonesty and the sensitive nature of the ex-relationship.
- While wanting to maintain friendships is understandable, the author is prioritizing their own preferences over their partner's comfort and the health of the relationship, and is not making a good faith effort to rebuild trust.
- The girlfriend's request is not inherently unreasonable given the circumstances.

- No one is acting with ill intent or malice. The coworker is being annoying, but not out of spite, and the author is within their rights to set boundaries.

- The author responded with one-word answers, stopped responding, and ultimately ghosted her, despite her attempts to communicate and reschedule.
- The girl’s reason for canceling was legitimate (illness), and she showed effort to maintain the relationship.
- Ghosting someone who is making a good-faith effort to communicate and reschedule, especially for reasons outside their control, is generally considered inconsiderate.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author's Actions:** The author is a security guard following the mall's rules: not allowing people to sleep in the mall, maintaining order, and enforcing bans when necessary. The author tried to handle the situation calmly, offered to help the regular get his cigarettes later, and only physically intervened after being punched.

2. **Regular's Actions:** The regular, while elderly and homeless, was breaking mall rules (sleeping, causing a disturbance, and ultimately assaulting the security guard). However, his behavior may be influenced by his alcoholism and age.

3. **Team Leader's Actions:** The team leader lifted the ban, possibly out of compassion, but did not provide clear guidance for handling repeat incidents. The team leader's criticism of the author seems more about tone than actions.

4. **OC's Actions:** The on-call guy promised cigarettes, which may have contributed to the regular's expectations, but this is a minor factor.

**Fault Analysis:**
- The author acted within the scope of their job and responded proportionally to the situation.
- The regular was at fault for the disturbance and assault, but his circumstances (age, alcoholism) complicate moral judgment.
- The team leader's decision to lift the ban is debatable but not clearly ""at fault.""
- No one is acting with clear malice or gross negligence; everyone is responding to a difficult situation as best they can.

**Conclusion:**  
While the regular's actions were inappropriate, the context (age, addiction, homelessness) makes it hard to assign full blame. The author did their job, and the team leader made a compassionate but debatable call. No one is clearly ""at fault"" in a way that warrants blame.

Final Answer: Info

Step by step reasoning:

1. The author describes a situation where they placed a hand basket with groceries directly on the conveyor belt, rather than unloading the items onto the belt.
2. The cashier reacted negatively, giving dirty looks and not speaking to the author, but chatting with others.
3. The author is unsure if their behavior (putting the basket on the belt) is a social faux pas or if the cashier was just having a bad day.

Analysis:
- In some stores, it is expected that customers unload their own baskets onto the belt, while in others, cashiers may do it for you. There is no universal rule, and practices vary by region, store policy, and even individual cashier preference.
- The author states they have done this ""100's of times before"" without issue, suggesting it is not universally considered rude or wrong.
- The cashier's reaction may have been excessive or unprofessional, but without knowing the store's policy or local norms, it's hard to assign clear fault.

Conclusion:
- More information is needed about the store's expectations and local norms to determine if the author was at fault for a social faux pas, or if the cashier was simply rude.

**Reasoning:**

- The author is understandably upset about her sister's choices and the impact on her wedding, but she admits to saying things she regrets and kicking her sister out of the wedding, which is a harsh reaction.
- The sister is making choices that are hurting herself and her family, but she is also in a difficult situation and may need support rather than judgment.
- The family dynamic is strained, and everyone seems to be contributing to the negativity and lack of communication.
- The fiancé and mother are also affected, and the overall situation is one where everyone is reacting emotionally and not constructively.

**Summary:**  
While the author has valid feelings, her actions (harsh words, exclusion) contribute to the conflict. The sister's choices also contribute to the situation. The family dynamic as a whole is suffering from poor communication and mutual disappointment. Therefore, ""Everybody"" is at fault to some degree.",stop,525,196,721

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
You (the author) are not wrong for feeling uncomfortable about your boyfriend's relationships with these coworkers, especially given their behavior and the context. However, the specific question is whether you are at fault (""the asshole"") for telling him not to get them anything.

While your concerns are understandable, telling your boyfriend who he can and cannot give gifts to crosses a boundary into controlling behavior. It's reasonable to express your feelings and have a conversation about boundaries and respect in your relationship, but dictating his actions—especially in a work context—can be seen as overstepping. The more constructive approach would be to communicate your discomfort and work together to find a solution that respects both your feelings and his professional relationships.

The mother initially presented herself as supportive and open, but then shifted to lecturing, guilt-tripping, and prying for personal details, which is emotionally manipulative and not in line with the initial supportive stance.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   The author and his father confronted the 16-year-old brother about his lack of social life and ""masculinity,"" pressuring him to be more like them and less introverted. The brother reacted angrily, swore at the father, and was punished by having his video games taken away. The author wonders if he is at fault for agreeing with the father's approach and thinking the brother was ungrateful.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The 16-year-old brother was minding his own business and not harming anyone.  
   - The father and author initiated an intervention that was unsolicited and based on their own standards of social success and masculinity.  
   - The approach was confrontational and dismissive of the brother's personality and interests.  
   - The brother's angry outburst was a reaction to being pressured and insulted, not an unprovoked act of disrespect.  
   - The punishment (removing video games) was a response to the outburst, but the outburst was provoked by the father and author.

3. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The father is clearly at fault for his approach and for escalating the situation.
   - The author is also at fault for supporting the father's view and not standing up for the brother, even though he later felt sorry for him.
   - The brother's reaction, while rude, was provoked and understandable given the circumstances.

4. **Who is the ""Author"" in this context?**  
   - The question is ""AITA?"" (Am I the asshole?), so the author is asking if he is at fault.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for participating in and supporting an intervention that was insensitive and harmful to his brother, even if he later felt some regret.

**Reasoning:**  
The main conflict here is about missing children's clothes and the ongoing tension between the author and the SO's ex (the ""baby's mama""). While the situation is frustrating and both parties have contributed to the tension, the specific question is about whether the author is at fault for calling the ex ""poor,"" or if the SO is at fault for not backing the author up after that comment.

Calling someone ""poor"" as an insult is a personal attack and escalates the situation unnecessarily. Regardless of the ongoing issues with the clothes, resorting to name-calling—especially about someone's financial status—is inappropriate and hurtful. The SO's decision to apologize to his ex is an attempt to de-escalate the situation and maintain a civil co-parenting relationship, which is important for the children's well-being.

Therefore, the author is at fault for making a personal, derogatory comment. The SO is not at fault for apologizing for that comment.",stop,424,206,630

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   The author quit their own Ph.D. program and is now trying to dissuade their girlfriend from pursuing a Ph.D. in engineering, citing both practical reasons (job market, opportunity cost, etc.) and personal reasons (their own desire for a partner who is working and contributing financially).

2. **Fault Assessment:**  
   - The author is entitled to their opinion and can share their experience.
   - However, the author is actively trying to dissuade their girlfriend from pursuing her own goals, based on both their own negative experience and their personal desires for the relationship.
   - The author acknowledges that their advice may be unsolicited and that their motivation is partly self-interested (""I want someone who can help me create the future I want"").
   - The girlfriend is not at fault for wanting to pursue her own academic and career goals.
   - There is no indication that ""other people"" are involved or at fault.
   - The author is not simply giving advice, but is persistently trying to steer his girlfriend away from her chosen path, which crosses a line from supportive partner to controlling behavior.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   The author is at fault for prioritizing their own desires and fears over their girlfriend's autonomy and goals, and for trying to unduly influence her major life decisions.

- The situation describes a friendship where one person feels hurt and neglected because the other is spending time with different friends and not reciprocating efforts to hang out.
- The friend’s response to confrontation was somewhat dismissive and possibly defensive, but not overtly malicious.
- The author is upset and feels manipulated, but also recognizes their own anger may be clouding their judgment.
- There is no clear evidence of malicious intent or egregious wrongdoing on either side—just miscommunication, mismatched expectations, and hurt feelings.
- Friendships sometimes go through rough patches, and both parties may have valid feelings and perspectives.

- The friend did not communicate with the author about not wanting or needing the shirt, nor did they offer to return it or discuss their intentions.
- The author is upset and considering asking for the shirt back, but has not acted on this yet.

Analysis:
- It is generally considered disrespectful to sell a gift, especially from a close friend, without discussing it with the giver, particularly when the giver made a financial sacrifice.

- The father, while portrayed as a victim, is also involved in escalating arguments and, at one point, physically assaulted the mother (slapped her), which is never justified.
- Both parents are engaging in destructive conflict, including shouting, emotional abuse, and physical violence, which is harmful to the family and especially to the child.
- The author is a child in a very difficult situation, but his action (insulting his mother) is still not ideal, even if understandable.
- The situation is a result of everyone’s actions and reactions, not just one person’s.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author (you) suggested career options to your girlfriend, which is not inherently wrong.
- However, you ""snapped"" at her and told her she ""needs to be proactive and better herself or else she'll be at Starbucks forever.""
- This statement is judgmental and dismissive of her autonomy and choices, and it implies her current job and decisions are not good enough.
- Your girlfriend expressed that your comment made you ""an asshole,"" indicating she felt hurt or disrespected.
- While it's understandable to want the best for a partner, the way you communicated your concerns was insensitive and crossed a line from supportive to critical.
- She is not at fault for not wanting to pursue a business career or go back to school; those are personal choices.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is expressing discomfort with their fiancee attending a male strip show as part of her bachelorette party.
- The fiancee and her sister (the planner) both consider the event harmless and ""classy,"" and the fiancee reassures that she is not getting a lap dance or engaging in anything inappropriate.
- The author admits that their fiancee is not the type to cheat and that nothing has been booked yet.
- The author is not comfortable with the idea and is considering ""putting their foot down"" to veto the event.
- The author compares this to their own bachelor party, which is more low-key, but acknowledges that this is their own choice.
- The key issue is whether the author is justified in forbidding their fiancee from attending a show that she and her friends consider harmless, especially when there is no evidence of inappropriate behavior or intent.

Conclusion:
- The author is at fault for attempting to control their fiancee's harmless bachelorette activities based on personal discomfort, despite reassurances and the context of the event. This crosses into controlling behavior, especially since the fiancee is not engaging in anything inappropriate and has communicated openly.
- The author is not an ""asshole"" in the sense of being malicious, but they are at fault for overstepping reasonable boundaries in a trusting relationship.",stop,498,283,781

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author describes a situation where a child, later revealed to have Down syndrome, was acting in a way the author found annoying or distressing.
- The author responded to the child's behavior by physically assaulting him (""beat him up... did land some fists on his face and body"").
- Regardless of the child's intent, costume, or disability, physically attacking someone—especially a child—is not an appropriate or justified response to annoyance or being startled.
- The author expresses regret, but the action itself (physical violence) is clearly at fault.
- There is no indication that anyone else provoked or encouraged the violence, nor is there evidence that the child did anything to warrant being physically attacked.

The author is at fault here.

Even if the author believes Susan is making a poor decision, the way they expressed their opinion was hurtful and not supportive, especially in a moment that was clearly important to Susan.

- The injury was an unintended consequence of trying to help, not a result of malice or negligence.
- The man who was behaving inappropriately is at fault for his actions, but the question is about the author’s responsibility for the injury.
- The author’s intent was to help, and the injury was accidental, so the author is not at fault for the injury.

- The author acknowledges that these fears are not unfounded, but then criticizes the women for ""dwelling"" on them and suggests that they are choosing to be afraid.
- This perspective dismisses the real and valid concerns that women have about their safety, especially given the prevalence of harassment and assault.
- The author is not at fault for not sharing the same fears, but is at fault for invalidating and minimizing the experiences and feelings of others, and for implying that their fear is a choice rather than a response to real risks.

Final Answer: Nobody

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author’s Actions:** The author experienced multiple traumatic events in a short period (loss of a grandparent, near-death experience, homelessness, loss of a pet). Under extreme stress, they snapped at friends who were repeatedly asking if they were okay. The author admits to raising their voice but did not direct personal insults or malice at their friends.

2. **Friends’ Actions:** The friends were trying to be supportive by checking in, but after being snapped at, they felt hurt and chose to confront the author about it. They also ignored the author for a period, which could be seen as immature but is a common teenage response to feeling hurt.

3. **Fault Analysis:** 
   - The author’s reaction was a result of overwhelming stress and trauma, not malice or intent to harm.
   - The friends’ feelings were valid; being snapped at can hurt, especially when trying to help. Their confrontation was an attempt to communicate their feelings, which is generally healthy.
   - Both parties acted in ways that are understandable given their ages and the circumstances. No one acted with clear malice or unreasonable behavior.

4. **Conclusion:** This is a situation where everyone’s feelings and actions are understandable and human. The author was not an “asshole” for snapping under extreme stress, and the friends were not wrong for feeling hurt and expressing it. This is a case of miscommunication and emotional overload, not fault.

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The group (including the author) repeatedly hung out at the same friend's house, late into the night, for several days in a row, sometimes on school/work nights. This likely disrupted the household, especially the half-siblings who are in school.
- The stepmother eventually set a boundary and asked them not to come over anymore, which is a reasonable request given the circumstances.
- The friend who lives there is calling his stepmother a ""demon"" for setting this boundary, which is unfair and disrespectful.
- The author recognizes that their behavior was inconsiderate, but the group as a whole (including the friend who lives there) contributed to the problem by not considering the impact on the household.
- The stepmother is not at fault for setting a reasonable boundary.
- The group is at fault for overstaying their welcome and not being considerate.
- The friend who lives there is also at fault for not respecting his stepmother's wishes and for encouraging the group to continue coming over.

The author is at fault in this situation. While the cousins' comments were clearly inappropriate and offensive, the author’s attempt to ""alleviate"" the situation by making a joke at his girlfriend’s expense—especially in front of people who were already being racist—was insensitive and dismissive of her feelings. The context matters: jokes about race or skin color between partners can be acceptable in private if both are comfortable, but making such a joke in a hostile environment, especially when the girlfriend was already being targeted, is hurtful and undermines her. Instead of supporting her, the author joined in with the mockery, even if unintentionally. Comparing her private jokes about his complexion to his public joke about hers ignores the power dynamics and the context of colorism she later explained.

- The author feels indebted and guilty, but ultimately communicated her feelings to her friend in a respectful way.
- There is no evidence of malicious intent from either party; both were acting out of necessity or comfort, and the author took the mature step of communicating her feelings.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**

Step by step:

1. **Author’s Actions:** The author has tried to communicate and resolve the issue with the child’s mother multiple times. He has not done anything to warrant distrust, has been present in his child’s life, and is seeking a legal resolution after other attempts failed. Filing for a custody hearing is a legal right and a reasonable step when informal negotiations break down.

2. **Mother’s Actions:** The mother is acting out of fear and concern for her child’s safety, which is understandable, especially with a young child and a pool involved. However, her refusal to allow any unsupervised time with the father, despite no evidence of neglect or harm, is restrictive and not necessarily justified.

3. **Guilt About Filing:** The author feels guilty for filing for custody without telling the mother first. However, custody hearings are a standard way to resolve such disputes, and it is not inherently wrong to seek legal intervention when informal solutions fail.

4. **Child’s Separation Anxiety:** The child’s anxiety is a natural result of being with one parent almost exclusively. This is not the fault of either parent, but rather a consequence of the current arrangement.

5. **No Malicious Intent:** Neither party appears to be acting out of malice. The mother is motivated by fear, and the father by a desire for a relationship with his child and family.

**Conclusion:**  
This is a difficult co-parenting situation with understandable fears and desires on both sides. The author is not at fault for seeking a legal resolution, and the mother is not at fault for being protective, though her fears may be excessive. The situation calls for mediation and legal guidance, not blame.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
- The author developed feelings for Jack, but did not act on them while he was in a relationship.
- The author dated Jack's best friend, Chris, but ended it politely due to lingering feelings for Jack and discomfort.
- Jack repeatedly asked why the author wasn't interested in Chris, prompting the author to eventually be honest about her feelings.
- The author made it clear she wasn't expecting anything from Jack and that her feelings were her own issue.
- Jack reacted negatively, feeling pressured and upset.

**Fault analysis:**
- The author tried to keep her feelings private and only shared them after being repeatedly questioned.
- Jack's reaction, while emotional, is understandable but not necessarily justified in blaming the author, since she was honest only after being pressed.
- There was no malice, manipulation, or boundary-crossing from the author.
- Chris is not at fault; he accepted the rejection gracefully.

3. **In front of you: an old lady (OL) and a 20-year-old man with injured legs.**
4. **Another old lady boards at the back, struggles to get a seat, but eventually is seated (not near you).**
5. **OL yells at you for not giving up your seat, even though the old lady in the back is already seated.**
6. **You check and see no other elderly people nearby.**
7. **You state you would give up your seat if someone needed it and asked.**
8. **OL insists young people shouldn't sit at all.**

**Analysis:**
- You did not ignore someone in need; the old lady in the back was already being helped and seated.
- You checked your immediate area and saw no one obviously in need.
- You were willing to give up your seat if someone asked or needed it.
- The old lady in front of you was upset, but her expectation (that young people should never sit) is not a reasonable social norm, especially if no one in need is present.
- You did not act rudely or aggressively; you simply defended your position and then let it go.

**Fault Assessment:**
- You are not at fault for sitting down when no one in need was present.
- The old lady in front of you was perhaps frustrated by the situation, but her anger was misdirected.
- The other passengers were helping as best they could in a crowded situation.

- The author wrote a strongly worded note after seeing the owner haul the trash out himself.
- The note was harsh, but the problem was the repeated inconsiderate behavior of the new tenants.
- The author feels a bit bad about the tone, but the core issue is the tenants' lack of responsibility.

- The author admits to having acted poorly in the past, which led to the end of those friendships.
- Now, the author has re-encountered these same people under a new identity and is considering not telling them who they are.
- The key ethical issue is whether withholding this information is deceptive or unfair to the group, especially since the author is seeking to rebuild friendships under a new persona without addressing past issues.
- While the author has changed and wants to move on, not disclosing their identity could be seen as dishonest, especially if the group would want to know or if it would affect their willingness to be friends.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author's actions:**
   - The author agreed to edit videos for QW, even after wanting to quit, and communicated that the current video would be the last.
   - When QW was dissatisfied and asked for a re-edit, the author agreed, possibly out of guilt or pressure (""being a doormat"").
   - The author was experiencing mental health struggles and communicated this to QW, asking for space and understanding.
   - The author used strong language (""Just let me fucking rest"") when feeling overwhelmed.

2. **QW's actions:**
   - QW pressured the author about the video, even after being told about the author's mental health struggles.
   - QW made an analogy comparing the situation to owing money to a bank, which is insensitive given the context.
   - QW continued to push, referencing promises and deadlines, and only relented after further protest from the author.

3. **Fault assessment:**
   - **QW is at fault** for being insensitive to the author's mental health, using harsh analogies, and not respecting boundaries.
   - **The author is at fault** for not setting firmer boundaries earlier, agreeing to work they didn't want to do, and for using strong language in frustration (though this is more understandable given the circumstances).
   - Both parties contributed to the escalation: QW by being pushy and insensitive, the author by not communicating limits earlier and letting resentment build.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Both parties share some responsibility for the conflict. QW's insensitivity and pressure are the main issues, but the author's lack of clear boundaries and communication contributed as well.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author and her partner live together.
   - Previously, they shared a house with another couple (N and D), but the friendship broke down due to N and D's poor treatment of the author's partner.
   - The author is willing to be friends with N again, but not to the extent of inviting her into their shared home, as her partner is uncomfortable with N.
   - The wider friend group is upset that N is not invited to hangouts at the author's house.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The author is respecting her partner's boundaries in their shared living space, which is reasonable since both pay rent and should feel comfortable at home.
   - The partner is not at fault for not wanting someone who treated him badly in his home.
   - N and D's past behavior was problematic, but the current question is about the author's actions.
   - The wider friend group is expressing their opinion, but they are not directly involved in the home situation.
   - The author is not preventing N from being part of the wider friend group, just not inviting her to her own home.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is not at fault for prioritizing her partner's comfort in their shared home.
   - The partner is not at fault for his boundaries.
   - The wider friend group is not at fault for expressing their feelings, though they may not understand the full context.
   - N is not being actively excluded from the friend group, just from the home where she made someone uncomfortable.

   - The neighbor is arguably being inconsiderate by sending her children over in this state and not supervising their hygiene or clothing.
   - However, the author is asking if *she* is the asshole (AITA) for wanting to say something or for her reaction.
   - The author’s actions so far (asking the kids to put on pants or play outside) are reasonable boundaries for her own home.
   - The author’s *attitude* and language (“pull her head in,” “lazy”) are judgmental and make assumptions about the neighbor’s parenting without knowing the full context (possible developmental delays, financial issues, etc.).
   - The author is considering confronting the neighbor in a potentially rude or confrontational way, rather than expressing her concerns kindly or setting boundaries for her own home.

3. **Fault assessment:**  
   - The neighbor is inconsiderate, but the author is at fault for her judgmental attitude and for considering an unkind confrontation.
   - The best course would be to set clear boundaries for her own home and, if concerned, express them kindly or offer support, not judgment.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for her approach and attitude, not for setting boundaries in her own home.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**
- The author is questioning whether they are at fault (""AITA?"") for telling their son not to sell the valuable heirloom and, if he does, to give half to his sister.
- The mother (grandmother) distributed the heirlooms without knowing their value, but her intent was to give sentimental gifts, not to create an unfair financial windfall.
- The son wants to sell the item for personal gain, but the author intervenes, suggesting he wait until the grandmother passes and to share the proceeds with his sister, who received a much less valuable item.
- The author is not at fault for the grandmother's distribution, nor for the son's desire to sell, but is questioning their own intervention.
- The author’s suggestion is an attempt to correct an unintentional imbalance and to respect the grandmother’s likely intent of equal treatment.
- The only questionable action is the author’s suggestion to wait until the grandmother dies before selling, which could be seen as disrespectful or encouraging secrecy.

Given the context, the author’s actions are well-intentioned and aimed at fairness, but the suggestion to wait until the grandmother dies before selling is ethically questionable. However, the main issue is the author’s intervention in the distribution and sale of the heirloom, so the author is the one at fault (if anyone is).

**Summary:** The author is at fault for suggesting to wait until the grandmother dies before selling and for dictating how the son should handle his gift, even if the intent was fairness.",stop,569,321,890

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is reflecting honestly on their feelings and attraction, which changed after their friend changed her appearance.
- The author is not criticizing or shaming the friend for her choices, nor are they planning to be cruel or ghost her.
- The author is considering distancing themselves because they realize they are not as interested in the friendship as they thought, now that the initial attraction is gone.
- People are allowed to change their feelings and to choose who they spend time with, as long as they are respectful and not hurtful.
- The friend has done nothing wrong; she is living her life and making her own choices.
- There is no evidence of malice, betrayal, or harm from either party.

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is upset because their friends gave positive feedback on a story, but the professor gave harsh criticism.
- The author explicitly asked for honest feedback and told their friends that lying is the worst offense for them.
- The friends gave positive feedback, which the author now believes was dishonest, based on the professor's comments.
- The professor's opinion is not necessarily the only valid one; writing is subjective, and different readers can have different reactions.
- However, if the friends were not honest in their feedback (especially after being asked for brutal honesty), they are at fault for not respecting the author's clear boundaries and request.
- The author is not at fault for trusting their friends or for being hurt by what they perceive as dishonesty.
- The situation does not indicate that ""everybody"" is at fault, nor that ""nobody"" is at fault, since the friends had a clear request and failed to honor it.
- The professor is not at fault for giving their honest opinion as a grader.
- While more info could always help, the core issue is the friends' response to a direct request for honesty.

**Reasoning:**  
You are not at fault for choosing not to accept your old friend back into your life. Your friend violated a significant boundary by making a move on your girlfriend while she was incapacitated, which is a serious breach of trust and consent. Additionally, you have observed a pattern of similar behavior from him, which reasonably leads you to believe he may repeat such actions. You have forgiven him but set a boundary for your own well-being, which is healthy and justified.

Your friend is at fault for his actions, but the question is about whether *you* are at fault for not accepting him back. Setting boundaries after a betrayal is not wrong. Your friend group may wish for harmony, but you are not obligated to ignore your own feelings or safety for the sake of group cohesion.

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Landlord Responsibilities:** As the landlord, you are responsible for maintaining the property in a habitable and safe condition, which includes fixing things that are broken or unsafe. You have responded promptly to previous maintenance requests (e.g., fixing the fence), which is appropriate.

2. **Pet Rent and Deposit:** You have clearly communicated that the pet rent and deposit are for potential property damage, not for pet safety or care. This is standard and reasonable.

3. **Gate Issue:** The gate is a part of the property, and if it is broken or not functioning as intended (e.g., not containing a dog), you could be expected to repair it in a reasonable timeframe. However, the primary responsibility for the dog's safety and well-being lies with the owner (the renter), especially since the dog is escaping due to being left outside inappropriately.

4. **Dog Welfare:** The renter is neglecting the dog by leaving it outside in the cold without shelter and not providing adequate care or attention. This is a clear case of neglect and is the renter’s responsibility, not yours.

5. **Threats from Renter:** The renter’s aggressive behavior and threats are inappropriate and do not shift responsibility for the dog’s welfare onto you.

6. **Moral and Legal Responsibility:** While you should maintain the property (including the gate), the renter is at fault for neglecting their dog and for not taking reasonable steps to ensure its safety and well-being.

**Conclusion:** The primary fault lies with the renter (Other) for neglecting their dog and for their unreasonable demands and threats. You are not at fault for the dog’s welfare, though you should continue to maintain the property as required by your lease and local laws.",stop,731,369,1100

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Review the conversation:**  
   - The author repeatedly brings up the idea that makeup is ""overrated,"" a ""gimmick,"" and that men ""like the authentic you.""
   - The woman responds that she enjoys makeup for herself, not for men, and pushes back on the idea that makeup is inauthentic.
   - The author continues to insist that men don't care about makeup and that ""the real thing"" is better, dismissing her perspective.
   - She explains that not wearing makeup leads to negative comments from others, and the author responds defensively.
   - She then clearly states that this isn't going to work, as she feels judged for wearing makeup.

2. **Assessing fault:**  
   - The author repeatedly invalidates her choices and preferences, implying that wearing makeup is less ""authentic"" and that it's a ""gimmick.""
   - He frames his opinion as representative of all men, dismissing her autonomy and reasons for wearing makeup.
   - When she sets a boundary and explains her perspective, he continues to push his own view rather than listening or respecting her stance.
   - This comes across as judgmental and condescending, even if unintentionally.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for not respecting her choices, for being dismissive, and for pushing a personal opinion in a way that made her feel judged and uncomfortable.
   - She communicated her boundaries clearly and chose to disengage, which is reasonable.

**Summary:**  
The author is at fault for the breakdown in communication and for making the other person feel judged about her personal choices.",stop,487,348,835

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is a 15-year-old who received a gift from their grandfather, while their 19-year-old sister did not, which is a recurring situation.
- The sister is upset and expresses her feelings, which is understandable given the repeated exclusion.
- The author, likely frustrated by the repeated situation, told their sister to ""get a grip,"" which could be seen as insensitive but is also a common reaction from a teenager in a tense family situation.
- The mother intervened by splitting the money, which may not be fair from the author's perspective, but is an attempt to address the sister's hurt feelings.
- The grandfather is the one making the gifting decision, which is the root cause of the issue, but he is not present in the immediate conflict.
- No one in the situation is acting with clear malice; everyone is reacting emotionally to a difficult family dynamic.

Given the context, no one is fully at fault—everyone is reacting to a complicated, emotionally charged situation. The author could have been more sensitive, but their reaction is understandable for their age. The mother is trying to mediate, and the sister is expressing hurt. The real issue is the grandfather's gifting pattern, but he is not directly involved in this conflict.

Step by step reasoning:
- The author wants to travel alone for personal growth and healing after a difficult year, and her boyfriend is supportive of this.
- The author’s friend is insisting that traveling alone means the author doesn’t love her boyfriend, and is pressuring her to break up or travel with him.
- The author is not doing anything wrong; she is communicating openly with her boyfriend, who is supportive.
- The friend is making assumptions about the author’s relationship and projecting her own beliefs about relationships onto the author.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step by step reasoning:
- Your girlfriend asked you a difficult and emotionally charged question, insisting on honesty.
- You tried to avoid answering, but she pressed you to be honest.
- When you answered honestly, she was hurt and upset, even though she had asked for honesty.
- This is a classic situation where emotions and expectations are in conflict: she wanted honesty, but also wanted reassurance.
- You could have handled it more delicately, but you were put in a tough spot by her insistence.
- She is upset by your answer, but also set up the situation by asking a question she may not have wanted the real answer to.
- Jim’s actions are not directly relevant to the conflict between you and your girlfriend.

Given all this, it seems like a miscommunication and mismatch of expectations, rather than clear fault on either side. Both parties acted in ways that are understandable, but neither did anything egregiously wrong.

- The author resorted to blocking the neighbor in as a last resort after other attempts failed.
- While the author's action (blocking the driveway) may be technically illegal, it was a response to the neighbor's repeated, willful disregard for the author's property rights.

- The author is not blaming their family in a mean-spirited way, but is expressing frustration and concern for their younger siblings.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author and Amy are frustrated because they always do the planning and feel the others don't contribute.
- Josh and Kate, when asked to plan, gave a list of restaurants and left the rest of the decisions to the author and Amy, which is not really taking on the planning responsibility.
- The author got upset and called them out, which led to an argument, but later apologized for the rudeness.
- The group eventually resolved the argument and hung out, but the underlying issue of unequal effort remains.

Fault analysis:
- Josh and Kate are at fault for not genuinely taking on the planning when asked, and for not communicating their preferences clearly (e.g., saying they don't want Chili's only after it was suggested).
- The author and Amy are at fault for letting frustration build up and for expressing it in a way that led to an argument, even if the frustration was understandable.
- The conflict arose from a lack of clear communication and shared responsibility, which is a group dynamic issue.

Final Answer: Info

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Relationship Context**: The author and his girlfriend have a generally good relationship, but there is a mismatch in sexual desire/frequency. The girlfriend prefers sex once a week, while the author would like more, but he respects her wishes.

2. **Use of Sex Toys**: The girlfriend uses vibrators/dildos 3-4 times a week, solo, and does not want the author to use them on her. The author watches porn, which the girlfriend dislikes but hasn't forbidden.

3. **Sex Doll Purchase**: The author bought a sex doll for personal use, which the girlfriend found upsetting and asked him to get rid of.

4. **Author’s Perspective**: He feels this is unfair, as she uses toys frequently and he sees the doll as a similar outlet.

5. **Fault Analysis**:
   - The author is not violating any explicit agreements, and is seeking a sexual outlet that does not involve cheating or violating consent.
   - The girlfriend is entitled to her feelings, but her reaction may be inconsistent given her own use of sex toys.
   - There may be underlying issues (e.g., emotional discomfort, boundaries, communication) that are not fully explored in the situation.

6. **Missing Information**:
   - Have they discussed boundaries around sex toys and masturbation in detail?
   - Is the girlfriend’s discomfort about the doll related to its human-like appearance, or is it about something else (e.g., feeling replaced, objectification)?
   - Has the author tried to understand her feelings, or is this a standoff?
   - Are there cultural, emotional, or personal values at play that make the doll different from a vibrator in her eyes?

**Conclusion**: There is not enough information to definitively assign fault. The situation is nuanced and depends on unspoken boundaries, communication, and emotional context. More discussion between the couple is needed to clarify expectations and feelings.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step by step reasoning:
- You offered your friend a place to stay, presumably as a gesture of support, but did not specify house rules about guests.
- Your friend brought people into your home without asking, which is inconsiderate, especially since you live with your family.
- You felt uncomfortable with strangers in your home, which is reasonable.
- You asked your friend about it and set a boundary (no girls/guests), which is within your rights as the homeowner.
- Your friend may have assumed some leeway, but ultimately, it’s your home and your family’s safety and comfort come first.

While your friend was inconsiderate, it’s not clear that he was malicious or that you were unreasonable. This is a situation where expectations and boundaries were not clearly communicated, leading to discomfort but not clear-cut fault. Setting boundaries after the fact is normal, and your friend should respect them.

Therefore, nobody is strictly ""at fault""—it’s a miscommunication and a learning moment for both parties.",stop,330,218,548

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author was approached by a salesperson and gave their information, but explicitly did **not** agree to schedule a visit.
- The company repeatedly called, and then scheduled and sent a technician **without the author's consent**.
- The author ignored the calls, which is reasonable since they never agreed to an appointment.
- The technician was sent based on a false premise (that the author had scheduled a visit), which was the company's error, not the author's.
- The author feels bad for the technician, but the responsibility for the miscommunication and wasted trip lies with the company and/or the salesperson who scheduled the visit without confirmation.

Therefore, the fault lies with the company/other people, not the author.",stop,416,159,575

**Reasoning:**
- The author lied about having a one night stand out of spite, which is dishonest and manipulative.
- The American girl ended her relationship without clear communication, tried to get back with her ex, and then slept with someone else as a reaction to the author's (supposed) actions.
- Both parties acted out of hurt and confusion, and both made questionable choices that contributed to the breakdown of trust and communication.
- The situation involves mutual miscommunication, dishonesty, and reactive behavior from both sides.

- The husband acknowledges the request in the moment but continues the behavior, disregarding the author's boundaries and the well-being of their child.
- The author’s escalation in tone is a result of repeated boundary violations, not an initial overreaction.

The author’s decision to cut contact is a response to ongoing mistreatment and boundary violations, not an act of malice or unprovoked hostility.

1. The ""Unwanted Cards"" bin is intended as a communal resource for anyone to look through and take cards they want.
2. Ned is monopolizing the bin by removing all the cards, sorting them, and intercepting new donations before they even enter the bin, which is against the spirit of the communal setup.
3. The author, feeling this is unfair, takes a chunk of cards from Ned's sorted pile and walks off without further discussion or agreement.
4. Both parties are acting in ways that are not fully respectful of the intended communal sharing: Ned by hoarding and intercepting, the author by taking cards from Ned's pile without clear communication or consensus.
5. Therefore, both share some fault for not respecting the communal nature and for not resolving the situation more amicably.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Situation Summary**: The author is a parent who is upset that their 10-year-old daughter enjoys practicing unusual facial and body movements (like covering her nostrils with her upper lip, ear wiggling, etc.). The author finds some of these behaviors ""ugly"" and has forbidden her daughter from doing one in particular, threatening punishment if she continues. The author's sister encourages the behavior, partly to annoy the author.

2. **Fault Analysis**:
   - The daughter is not at fault; she is a child exploring her body and abilities in a harmless way.
   - The sister may be a bit provocative, but her actions are not harmful to the child.
   - The author is attempting to control harmless self-expression because of personal aesthetic preferences, not because of any real harm or danger.
   - The author is threatening punishment for a behavior that is not dangerous or disruptive, but simply ""ugly"" in their view.

3. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Children should be allowed to explore and express themselves, especially in ways that are not harmful.
   - Parental guidance is important for safety, but the author admits the behaviors are not dangerous, just ""ugly.""
   - Stifling harmless self-expression can be damaging to a child's confidence and creativity.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The author is at fault for trying to control their daughter's harmless self-expression based on personal discomfort, rather than any legitimate concern for the child's well-being.

You are not preventing Charles or David from seeing each other or from being happy; you are simply setting boundaries for your own comfort.

**Reasoning:**  
This is a situation involving complex emotions, honesty, and vulnerability. The author was following therapeutic advice and chose to be honest with his girlfriend about lingering feelings for his ex, not out of malice or deceit, but in an attempt to be open and seek support. The girlfriend’s reaction—being hurt or needing space—is also understandable, as hearing that your partner still loves their ex can be painful. However, neither party acted with ill intent or malice. The author did not betray, lie, or act irresponsibly, and the girlfriend’s emotional response is natural. This is a difficult, emotionally charged situation, but it does not involve clear fault or wrongdoing by either party. It is a matter of navigating difficult feelings and communication, not blame.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author describes a situation where a larger man takes the middle seat, and his size encroaches on the author's and their friend's space, making them uncomfortable.
- The author responds to the discomfort by moving around, which the man complains about. The author refuses to accommodate, which is understandable to a point.
- The author and friend text to communicate, which annoys the man, but they adjust by silencing their phones.
- The author escalates the situation by showing pepper spray and later threatening to pepper spray the man, which is a significant overreaction and a threat of violence.
- The author continues to act in a way that intentionally causes discomfort to the man (squishing his fat, asking why he is still touching them, etc.).
- The man eventually moves seats.

While the man may have been inconsiderate by taking up more space than his seat allowed, the author's actions—especially the threat of violence—are disproportionate and inappropriate. The author could have handled the situation with more patience and without resorting to threats.

Final Answer: Everybody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Jack** is clearly at fault for cheating on his wife, Jasmine. Regardless of the circumstances, infidelity is a breach of trust and commitment in a marriage.
2. **Hannah** is also at fault for engaging in a romantic/sexual relationship with Jack while he is married, especially given her close friendship with him and knowledge of the situation.
3. **Jasmine** may have acted immaturely and contributed to drama, but she is not responsible for Jack's or Hannah's actions. Her behavior may have strained relationships, but it does not justify being cheated on.
4. The **friend group** (including the author) mostly stayed out of the drama, which is reasonable, but the author’s question implies some blame toward Jasmine for ""setting herself up"" for being cheated on. This is a problematic perspective, as no one ""sets themselves up"" to be betrayed; the responsibility for cheating lies with those who cheat.
5. The **author** is not directly at fault for the cheating, but the framing of the question suggests a lack of empathy for Jasmine and a tendency to excuse Jack and Hannah’s actions because of Jasmine’s personality.

**Conclusion:**  
Jack and Hannah are both at fault for the cheating. Jasmine is not at fault for being cheated on, regardless of her behavior. The author’s attitude is questionable, but not directly responsible for the cheating. Since the question is about who is at fault in the situation as a whole, and both Jack and Hannah are actively involved in the wrongdoing, the best answer is ""Everybody"" (meaning all directly involved parties, not Jasmine).",stop,749,343,1092

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is not at fault for throwing away food they do not want or that is unhealthy for them, especially after repeatedly communicating their preferences and needs to their mom.
- The mom is not necessarily at fault either; her actions seem to come from a place of care and possibly difficulty adjusting to her child living away from home. She may also have memory issues, as the author notes.

- The most recent interaction was brief and awkward, and there was a subsequent social media exchange (the content of which is not provided here, only a link).
- The core of the conflict seems to revolve around feelings of abandonment and lack of communication, but without the actual content of the Facebook conversation, it's impossible to fully evaluate who is at fault in the most recent incident.

3. Regardless of the provocation, the author committed a criminal act (property damage, potential intimidation).
4. The author’s father, a retired law enforcement officer, also told the author that they committed a crime.
5. The correct legal and ethical response would have been to continue pursuing legal channels, not to commit a retaliatory crime.

- The author admits that their main concern is the car itself, not the safety of their dad or uncle.
- In a situation where safety should be the priority, prioritizing the car's condition over the well-being of family members is generally considered selfish.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author's feelings:** The author is expressing frustration and anger about their brother's choices, particularly regarding financial dependence on grandparents and the perceived impulsiveness of the marriage. However, feeling angry or disagreeing with a family member's decisions is not inherently a ""fault""—it's a personal emotional response.

2. **Brother and girlfriend's actions:** The brother and his girlfriend are making life choices that the author disagrees with, but they are not breaking any laws or ethical codes. They are relying on family support, which is not uncommon, especially if the family is willing and able to provide it.

3. **Grandparents' role:** The grandparents are providing financial support, but there is no indication they are being coerced or manipulated. If they are willingly helping, it is their prerogative.

4. **Family dynamics:** The family is divided in opinion, but disagreement does not equate to someone being ""at fault."" The mother is supportive, another brother agrees with the author, and the author is considering skipping the wedding.

5. **No clear wrongdoing:** There is no evidence of malice, harm, or unethical behavior from any party. The situation is one of differing values and opinions, not of fault.

- The author is honest about their feelings and does not express animosity or intent to hurt anyone.
- The family is upset, but their reaction is based on their own expectations and grief.
- Grief and emotional responses vary greatly between individuals; not feeling sadness or not wanting to attend a funeral does not make someone ""at fault.""
- The author is not actively harming anyone, just expressing their own boundaries and limitations.
- The family is also not at fault for being upset; their feelings are valid too.

   - The friend moved in after a breakup, which is reasonable.
   - He quickly moved out without notice, leaving behind personal belongings, including a TV (originally his ex’s) and guns (which he knew made you uncomfortable).
   - He ignored repeated requests to collect his guns, only retrieving them after a month.
   - He left the TV and other items for months, with no communication or arrangement for their retrieval.

2. **Author's Actions:**  
   - Provided significant help and accommodation.
   - Made repeated, reasonable requests for the friend to collect his belongings.
   - Gave the TV (originally the ex’s) to the ex after a long period, with no indication the friend wanted it or would retrieve it.
   - Communicated honestly with all parties.

3. **Ex’s Actions:**  
   - Accepted the TV, which was originally hers.

4. **Current Girlfriend’s Actions:**

- Jenn is navigating complex feelings about her identity and may have felt hurt or rejected, leading to her reaction.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Step by step:

1. The author (you) set clear boundaries with P. after he confessed his feelings, making it clear you are not interested and that his advances are inappropriate.
2. P. disregarded these boundaries, continued to make advances, sent inappropriate messages, and tried to guilt-trip you by accusing you of homophobia and seeking pity.
3. After a period of no contact, you gave P. a second chance, but he again crossed boundaries by trying to turn friendly activities into dates, asking others if he had a chance with you, and escalating his behavior in public.
4. P. made you uncomfortable in front of your girlfriend and others, ignored your discomfort, and continued to act inappropriately.
5. You attempted to address the issue directly, but P. did not acknowledge his inappropriate behavior and continued to contact you.

**Conclusion:**  
P. is at fault for repeatedly disregarding your boundaries, making unwanted advances, and creating uncomfortable situations despite clear communication from you. The author’s actions (setting boundaries, communicating discomfort, and eventually choosing to cut contact) are reasonable and justified. There is no evidence that the author or anyone else contributed to the problem in a way that would make them at fault.

- The author knowingly helped a person who appeared to be intoxicated and had just crashed their vehicle, likely due to driving under the influence.
- By removing the driver from the scene and not reporting his attempt to evade responsibility, the author potentially interfered with law enforcement and the legal process.
- While the author did not agree to lie about who was driving, they did assist the individual in avoiding immediate legal consequences (DUI, hit and run, etc.).
- The author’s actions, though perhaps motivated by compassion, enabled the driver to escape accountability, which is generally considered unethical and possibly illegal (aiding and abetting).

- The author wonders if he should have lied, but admits he tried to avoid the conversation.

- While honesty is generally a good policy, tact and empathy are crucial in sensitive situations, especially regarding someone's appearance.
- The author could have focused on what he genuinely finds attractive about her, or emphasized her positive qualities, rather than giving a numerical rating or saying she couldn't improve.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**
- The author (Me) did not make any romantic or sexual advances toward OLG, kept conversations non-flirty, and was not obligated to respond to messages while sleeping.
- OLG misrepresented herself online (catfishing) and then accused the author of leading her on, despite no evidence of such behavior.
- The mutual friend who confronted the author and pressured him to ""give her a chance"" also acted inappropriately by making assumptions and getting involved without knowing the full story.
- The author’s friends (F1, F2) did not act in a way that caused harm; they helped the author out of an uncomfortable situation.
- The main fault lies with OLG for misrepresentation and overreacting, and with the mutual friend for unwarranted confrontation.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is expressing their feelings about their parents having another child, given the family's financial and relational instability.
- The author is not taking any action to harm anyone; they are simply choosing not to be emotionally involved or enthusiastic.
- The parents are making a personal decision about their own family planning, which, while it may be unwise from a financial or relational standpoint, is ultimately their choice.
- The author is not responsible for their parents' choices, nor are they obligated to feel a certain way about it.
- There is no clear wrongdoing or harm being done by anyone in this situation; it's a matter of personal feelings and family dynamics.

The primary person at fault in this situation is the father, who is engaging in extremely reckless and dangerous behavior by intentionally driving in a way that endangers the lives of his passengers and others on the road as a means of intimidation. This is not only morally wrong but also illegal and abusive.

While the author’s refusal to wear a seatbelt is not a safe or healthy response, the root cause and the most egregious fault lies with the father’s actions. The author’s behavior is self-destructive but does not endanger others in the same way the father’s driving does. Therefore, the father (Other) is at fault.",stop,409,145,554

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Agreement**: The author and their roommate agreed to split rent. The author sometimes paid late, but the roommate was understanding as long as the author paid back.

2. **Missed Payments**: The author missed some payments and only recently realized, after checking, that two months are still owed.

3. **Roommate’s Girlfriend**: The roommate’s girlfriend moved in unofficially and did not contribute to rent. The author never raised the issue of changing the rent split.

4. **Moral Dilemma**: The author feels it’s unfair to pay half the rent when a third person lives there, but never discussed this with the roommate.

5. **Fault Analysis**:
   - The author is at fault for not paying the agreed-upon rent on time and for not raising the issue of the girlfriend’s contribution when it started.
   - The roommate could be seen as inconsiderate for not offering to adjust the rent split, but the author never brought it up.
   - The girlfriend is not directly involved in the rent agreement.

6. **Conclusion**: The author is at fault for not fulfilling their explicit agreement and for not communicating concerns about the rent split when the situation changed. The roommate cannot be expected to read the author’s mind or change the arrangement unilaterally.

Therefore, the author is at fault for the missed rent and for not addressing the rent split issue earlier.",stop,600,306,906

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The situation describes a difference in values and habits regarding possessions between the author and their boyfriend.
2. The author prefers to treat things carefully and expects them to last, while the boyfriend is more experimental and less concerned about wear and tear, offering to replace things if they break.
3. The author feels uncomfortable with the boyfriend's treatment of their possessions, especially the car, and wonders if they are wrong (""an asshole"") for wanting him to be more careful.
4. There is no indication of malice, neglect, or intentional harm from either party. The boyfriend treats his own possessions the same way and is willing to take responsibility for damage.
5. The core issue is a mismatch in expectations and communication, not wrongdoing or fault.

Final Answer: Other

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Medicine Incident:** The mother gave the child adult NyQuil, lied about it, and was evasive when asked. This is a serious breach of trust and safety, especially with children.

2. **Subsequent Relationship:** The mother has been distant, skipping family events, and prioritizing her fiancé. This is her choice, but it contributes to the strained relationship.

3. **Suit Shopping Incident:** When the child was sick, the mother responded with a lack of empathy, threatened to exclude the boys from her wedding, and swore at the author.

4. **Escalation:** The mother continued to escalate via text, making accusations and being hostile.

5. **Author’s Response:** The author responded by calling out her behavior, referencing the medicine incident, and expressing disappointment. The author did not use abusive language or escalate beyond expressing frustration.

6. **Mother’s Final Action:** The mother sent a manipulative voice message to the child, blaming the parents and suggesting they are keeping the children away, which is not supported by the author’s account.

**Conclusion:**  
The mother’s actions—lying about medicine, being hostile, making manipulative statements to a child, and generally being unsupportive—are the primary cause of the conflict. The author’s responses, while frustrated, are reasonable given the circumstances and do not cross into abusive or unreasonable territory.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author describes a history of being let down, manipulated, and hurt by both their aunt and mother.
- The aunt has repeatedly violated trust (stealing, lying, taking advantage of the family, letting the cat out).
- The mother has a pattern of substance abuse, legal trouble, and unreliability, which has caused the author pain and disappointment.
- The author is asking if they are ""the asshole"" (at fault) for choosing to cut ties and not wanting to speak to their mother or aunt.
- There is no indication that the author has acted maliciously or unjustly; rather, they are setting boundaries for their own well-being.
- The aunt and mother have their own issues, but the question is about the author's fault in the situation.

Conclusion: The author is not at fault for protecting themselves emotionally and setting boundaries. The situation is unfortunate, but nobody is at fault for the estrangement itself given the circumstances described.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is upset about a breakup and is venting in a group chat, expressing a need for emotional support rather than advice.
- The friends respond with sympathy and then offer advice about not getting invested too quickly.
- The author sets a boundary, asking not to be given advice and explaining their reasoning.
- The friend clarifies their intent was to help and expresses feeling a bit hurt by the response.
- The conversation ends without escalation or personal attacks.

No one in this situation is acting maliciously or with clear fault:
- The author is communicating their needs and boundaries, which is healthy.
- The friends are trying to help in the way they know how, and when asked to stop, they do.
- There is some minor friction, but it is handled with explanations and politeness.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**
- You volunteered personal information about Rebecca (her political affiliation) in a public setting without her explicit consent.
- Even if you thought it was a harmless or funny anecdote, it’s generally not appropriate to “out” someone’s beliefs or identity, especially in a context where there could be social repercussions.
- The fact that Rebecca felt “humiliated and isolated” indicates that your action had a negative impact on her, regardless of your intentions.
- While Rebecca is a political science major and may not be secretive about her views, that does not mean she consents to having them shared in every context, especially in a way that singles her out.
- You acknowledge that you should not volunteer information about others that they may not want public, which shows awareness of the boundary crossed.

**Summary:**  
While the environment and Rebecca’s openness about her beliefs may complicate things, the responsibility for sharing her political affiliation in this context lies with you. The appropriate action would have been to let Rebecca share her own background if she wished.",stop,427,224,651

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author assumed exclusivity without having a conversation about it. This is a common mistake, but it is still a mistake—expectations should be communicated.
- The woman, while technically not ""cheating"" due to lack of exclusivity, acted inconsiderately by making out with someone else in front of the author, especially after giving him a lot of attention earlier in the night. This is insensitive and likely to cause hurt.
- The author’s reaction—yelling and making a scene at her party—was understandable given the emotional context, but still inappropriate and escalated the situation, contributing to the party being ""ruined.""
- Both parties failed to communicate clearly and both acted in ways that hurt the other and caused drama.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is a young person who has experienced bullying and anti-Semitism because of her appearance, which is closely tied to her Jewish heritage.
- She wants a nose job to feel more comfortable and confident, not to reject her heritage, but to avoid further bullying and social exclusion.
- Her parents are upset because they see this as a rejection of their heritage, especially as a minority in their area, and are likely projecting their own fears and experiences onto her.
- Both sides have valid feelings: the author wants to feel accepted and safe, while the parents want to preserve cultural pride and identity.
- There is no clear malice or wrongdoing from either party; this is a situation of conflicting values and pain, not one of fault or blame.

While it’s understandable to feel a sense of ownership and pride over a carefully curated playlist, music is inherently a social and shareable experience—especially between partners. The wife following the author’s playlist and adding songs to her own is a common and generally accepted way to share and enjoy music. The author’s request for the wife to delete songs or play them in a different order comes across as possessive and unnecessarily controlling, especially since the music is being enjoyed together in a shared space. The author is at fault for not being more open and collaborative about the music experience, and for making a demand that is likely to feel hurtful or exclusionary to the wife.",stop,367,150,517

The main issue in this situation is the boyfriend's repeated pattern of drinking to the point of endangering himself (e.g., nearly drowning in the tub, previously breaking his face while drunk in the tub, and getting angry when his partner tries to help). The author is frustrated and upset, but her actions (pouring beer on him, yelling) are reactions to his dangerous behavior and her concern for his safety. The boyfriend is responsible for his own drinking and the consequences that follow, especially since he is aware of the risks and the distress it causes his partner.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step by step reasoning:
- The author broke up with their partner due to personal struggles (depression, loneliness, confusion).
- The ex did not respond with much empathy, which hurt the author.
- The author later regretted the breakup and tried to reconnect, but the ex did not want contact and eventually blocked the author.
- The author wonders if they would be at fault for trying to reconnect, or if the ex is at fault for not listening.

Analysis:
- The author is not at fault for ending a relationship due to mental health struggles, nor for feeling regret and loneliness afterward.
- The ex is not at fault for choosing not to engage or rekindle the relationship, especially after being contacted multiple times post-breakup.
- Both parties are entitled to their feelings and boundaries. The ex has the right to move on and not respond, and the author has the right to feel hurt but should respect the ex's boundaries.
- There is no clear wrongdoing or malice from either side; it is a difficult situation with hurt feelings, but not one where blame is appropriate.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Both parties were involved in drinking and making out, which was consensual at the time.
- The author describes grabbing her without explicit consent, and she told him ""don't do it."" He stopped, which is good, but the initial action was not okay.
- The author then asked for nudes. She declined, and he accepted that, which is appropriate.
- However, the author then told her he didn't want to see her and called what they did ""disgusting,"" which could be hurtful and dismissive, especially after she expressed affection.
- The girl told the class about the situation, which led to social consequences for the author.
- The classmates' reaction may be based on their perception of the author's actions, especially the physical boundary crossing and the way he treated her afterward.

While both made mistakes, the author crossed a physical boundary after being told not to, and then was emotionally dismissive. These actions are more clearly at fault than anything the girl did. The classmates' reaction, while harsh, is a response to the author's behavior.

- The rest of the group was upset about the lack of transparency and the feeling of censorship.
- Once the reason was revealed (the word is a trigger for the owner), the group agreed to be considerate and avoid the word.
- Despite this, the owner refuses to remove the filter, maintaining unilateral control over what can be said.

While the owner has a right to feel safe and comfortable, especially if the word is genuinely distressing, the lack of communication and refusal to compromise after the group showed understanding and willingness to self-moderate suggests the owner is at fault for not trusting their friends and for continuing to enforce a rule that now feels unnecessary and authoritarian to the group.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The author acknowledges and takes responsibility for their past behavior, which was manipulative and hurtful. They are not asking about fault for the past, but for the present situation.
- In the present, the author did not do anything intentionally to hurt their ex. The ex confessed lingering feelings and became emotional, but the author did not provoke or manipulate this reaction.
- The ex's emotional response is a result of his own feelings and unresolved issues from the past, not something the author caused in the moment.
- The author responded honestly and did not lead him on or act cruelly.
- While the author feels guilty, there is no clear action in the present that would make them ""at fault"" for his reaction. Emotional pain from past relationships can resurface, but that does not mean the other person is at fault for the expression of those feelings now, especially if they are not being cruel or manipulative in the present.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Firing Cruella**: Based on the situation, firing Cruella for insubordination and poor cooperation is within your managerial rights, especially if her behavior is disruptive and she is not following reasonable instructions. This action, in itself, is not necessarily unethical or ""asshole"" behavior, especially if you have documented her issues and given her warnings.

2. **Withholding Pay**: However, the question specifically asks about firing her **without giving her severance or her last month’s pay**. Severance pay is often discretionary (unless contractually obligated), but **withholding pay for work already performed is unethical** and, in most jurisdictions, illegal—even if labor laws are weak. Employees are entitled to be paid for the work they have done, regardless of the circumstances of their termination.

3. **Intent to Punish**: Your stated motivation is to ""punish her"" by withholding pay. This is vindictive and goes beyond professional conduct. Even if she has been difficult, it does not justify denying her earned wages.

4. **Responsibility**: While your uncle and Cruella both have contributed to the toxic environment, the specific act of firing someone without paying them for work done is your decision and your responsibility.

Therefore, **you would be at fault (""the asshole"") if you fired her and withheld her pay**. Firing her with proper pay and documentation is reasonable; withholding pay is not.",stop,775,307,1082

Final Answer: Author

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author and friends mocked a political art exhibit in a public youth center.
   - The author posted mocking content on social media, specifically targeting Marxist/communist themes.
   - When a friend was upset, the author doubled down, made a more personal attack, and name-dropped someone, calling them a ""commie asshole"" and referencing their alleged misconduct.
   - The author later deleted the post but did not apologize and stands by their actions.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - **Mocking the exhibit:** While expressing disagreement with the exhibit is not inherently wrong, mocking it loudly in a shared public space can be disrespectful to others who may appreciate or identify with the content.
   - **Social media posts:** Publicly trash-talking the exhibit and those who support its ideas, especially in a way that singles out individuals, crosses into personal attack territory.
   - **Name-calling and personal attacks:** Calling someone a ""commie asshole"" and referencing their alleged misconduct in a public or semi-public forum is a clear escalation and is generally considered inappropriate, regardless of political disagreement.
   - **Refusal to apologize:** The author acknowledges that their actions upset someone but refuses to apologize, indicating a lack of willingness to take responsibility for the impact of their words.

3. **Other parties:**  
   - The youth center may be at fault for not adhering to its own apolitical policy, but this is not the main focus of the interpersonal conflict described.
   - The friend who was upset did not act inappropriately; they simply expressed their feelings.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for escalating the situation, making personal attacks, and refusing to apologize for behavior that was hurtful to others. The core issue is not the political disagreement, but the way the author chose to express it and the personal nature of their attacks.

**Therefore, the author is at fault.**",stop,714,417,1131

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
Based on your description, there was no established relationship or agreement between your friend and the girl prior to that night. Your friend expressed an intention or hope to hook up with her, but intentions alone do not create an obligation for you or the girl. The girl is free to make her own choices, and you did not betray any explicit trust or arrangement. While your friend is understandably disappointed, no one is objectively ""at fault"" in this situation. Social dynamics can be complicated, but unless there was a prior agreement or understanding, you are not an ""asshole"" for what happened.

**Bonus:**  
You are not an asshole if you pursue something with this girl, as long as you are respectful and honest with both her and your friend. If you value your friendship, you might want to talk to your friend about it, but you are not inherently in the wrong for being interested in her.",stop,307,198,505

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**
You (the author) are not at fault for being upset or wanting to confront your mother about the money she borrowed and has not returned. The money was given to you as a gift by your relatives, with the intention that you use it for yourself. Your mother taking your savings without asking, and not returning it even after reminders, is not appropriate, regardless of your family's financial situation. It is reasonable for you to expect your personal savings to be respected, especially since your father borrows and returns money in a considerate way.

You are not a ""bad person"" or ""spoilt"" for feeling this way. Wanting your boundaries and property to be respected is normal. The fault here lies with your mother for not respecting your savings and not returning the money as promised.

**Reasoning:**
You (the author) are not at fault for choosing to sit out of an activity that you are no longer enjoying, especially when you have communicated your reasons respectfully and without demanding the group change for you. You made it clear you would like to rejoin when the group plays games you enjoy more, and you did not insult or blame anyone.

The fault lies with the group members who responded by calling you a ""sore loser"" and ""immature"" for making a reasonable, honest decision about your own time and enjoyment. Their reaction is dismissive and unsympathetic, and it unfairly characterizes your actions as negative when you were simply setting a boundary for your own well-being.

You are not obligated to participate in activities that are no longer fun for you, and you handled the situation maturely. The negative response from some group members is unwarranted and makes them at fault in this situation.",stop,932,201,1133

A little...",Other,Other,0.95,0.9251798561151079,True,"Confidence: 0.95

The step-by-step reasoning is as follows:

1. **The Situation**: The girlfriend is destroying a scrapbook made by the child's biological mother, which contains pictures of the mother and the child, and some with the whole family. The child is upset and asks her to stop. The father intervenes and stops the destruction.

2. **Stakeholders**:
   - The child: Has a right to her memories and connection to her biological mother, regardless of the mother's current involvement.
   - The biological mother: Made a scrapbook as a parting gift, which is a positive gesture.
   - The girlfriend (stepmother): Has been raising the child and feels threatened or jealous, leading her to destroy the pictures.
   - The father (author): Intervenes to stop the destruction and stores the pictures away.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The girlfriend's actions are destructive and disrespectful to both the child and the biological mother. She is prioritizing her own feelings over the child's well-being and emotional needs.
   - The child is clearly upset, indicating harm is being done.
   - The author/father intervenes appropriately and tries to preserve the child's memories.
   - The biological mother, despite her absence, is not at fault for making a scrapbook.

4. **Fault**:
   - The only person acting inappropriately is the girlfriend, who is destroying the child's property and disregarding the child's feelings.
   - The author is not at fault; he acts to protect his daughter's interests.
   - The biological mother is not at fault.
   - The child is not at fault.

Therefore, the person at fault is the girlfriend (the ""other"" in the options).

Step by step reasoning:  
- The author is asking if they are wrong for wanting to know where their boyfriend is and who he is with.  
- The boyfriend asserts his right to privacy and does not want to share this information.  
- The author feels uncomfortable and suspicious due to the boyfriend's secrecy.  
- There is no evidence of controlling or abusive behavior from the author, nor is there evidence of the boyfriend doing anything wrong beyond wanting privacy.  
- Relationship expectations about privacy and transparency can vary widely and are best set by mutual agreement.  
- Without more information about the nature of their relationship, prior agreements, or patterns of behavior, it is difficult to assign fault definitively.

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault here, primarily for laughing at their fiancée's feelings rather than for eating the cheese itself. While it was understandable that the author didn't know how much cheese was in the bag or how much their fiancée wanted, the key issue is the reaction—laughing at her being upset. This response is dismissive of her feelings, especially since the cheese was a special gift from her mother and may have had sentimental value. A more empathetic response would have been to apologize and acknowledge her disappointment. Thus, the author is at fault for how they handled the situation emotionally, not necessarily for eating the cheese.",stop,441,143,584

- You made an effort to spend time with your girlfriend and her daughter, even though you were tired.
- You communicated your limitations and concerns (not wanting to fall asleep at the wheel, not being able to stay out late).
- Your girlfriend was disappointed and may have felt rejected, but her reaction seems to be based on her feelings rather than any wrongdoing on your part.
- There is no evidence of malice, neglect, or unreasonable behavior from either party—just a difficult situation caused by illness and mismatched expectations.

- The author later realizes that Steven may be on the autism spectrum and has survived cancer, which adds context but does not excuse the bullying.
- While Steven's behavior may be disruptive or frustrating, the author is reflecting on their own actions and recognizes them as morally wrong.

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Summary of the situation:**  
   - The author was subjected to repeated sexual harassment by a coworker over several years.
   - The coworker engaged in inappropriate touching, comments, and exposure.
   - The author was afraid to confront him or report him due to fear of not being believed and fear of confrontation.
   - Eventually, after being prodded, the author reported the behavior, and the coworker was fired.

2. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The coworker is clearly at fault for repeated, egregious sexual harassment.
   - The author is not at fault for being afraid to confront or report the behavior sooner; fear and trauma responses are normal in such situations.
   - The company appears to have acted appropriately once informed.
   - There is no indication that anyone else is at fault.

3. **Is the author at fault for not being clear or for reporting?**  
   - No. Victims of harassment are never at fault for the actions of their harassers, nor for the timing or manner in which they report.

- There is no evidence of malice, neglect, or disrespect—just a difference in habits and perhaps communication styles.

- The other person is not intentionally ignoring the author's feelings, but may simply have a different texting habit or genuinely fall asleep.

- The author communicated their discomfort and boundaries, which is appropriate.

   - The author is a volunteer at a university women's center.
   - Another student (paid staff) made derogatory comments about sex workers, implying they ""deserve everything they get"" and dismissing their experiences of assault.
   - The staff member also expressed unwillingness to provide pro-choice information, despite the center's pro-choice mandate.
   - The staff member pressured the author for public forgiveness and a hug.
   - The author is considering filing a formal complaint due to the staff member's behavior and is concerned about the impact on vulnerable students.

2. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The author did not act inappropriately; they were the target of insensitive and discriminatory remarks.
   - The staff member made harmful, stigmatizing, and exclusionary comments, which are especially inappropriate in a women's center meant to support all women, including sex workers and those seeking reproductive health support.
   - The staff member also attempted to coerce a public display of forgiveness, which is manipulative.
   - The author is considering a formal complaint, which is a reasonable and appropriate response to the staff member's behavior.

3. **Is anyone else at fault?**

**Reasoning:**  
This is a situation where neither party is truly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. Both people have legitimate needs and constraints:  
- The author is overwhelmed with school and life, and genuinely cannot give more time or energy to the relationship.
- The girlfriend has reasonable expectations for attention and communication in a relationship, and feels neglected.

Long-distance relationships are difficult, especially with time zone differences and busy schedules. Both parties tried to compromise (weekly calls), but when that became unsustainable, the girlfriend communicated her needs, and the author was unable to meet them. The breakup, while painful, is a result of incompatible circumstances rather than malice or wrongdoing.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author's actions:** The author (OP) has set a personal boundary: she does not want to be close friends with someone who maintains a friendship with her abuser. She has communicated this boundary calmly and directly to M, multiple times. She has not demanded M end the friendship, but has explained her feelings and the impact on her.

2. **M's actions:** M has chosen to continue her friendship with T, despite knowing about the abuse. She has justified this by saying T reached out to her, and that she can be friends with whomever she wants. She has also told the author that she feels uncomfortable being asked to end her friendship with T.

3. **Fault analysis:**  
   - The author is not at fault for setting a boundary for her own well-being, nor for choosing to distance herself from someone who is friends with her abuser.
   - M is not strictly ""at fault"" either. She is allowed to choose her friends, even if others disagree with her choices. While some may find her decision questionable, especially given her knowledge of the abuse, she is not obligated to end her friendship with T.
   - There is no evidence of malicious intent or clear wrongdoing from either party. This is a situation of incompatible boundaries and values, not one of clear fault.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - This is a painful but not uncommon situation where two people have incompatible boundaries and values. Both are making choices for themselves, and while those choices mean the friendship may end, neither is objectively ""at fault"" in a moral sense.

- The boyfriend wants to include his little sister, which is understandable, but not required or expected.
- The author feels uncomfortable around children and values the limited time she gets with her boyfriend due to their LDR.
- The author is considering asking her boyfriend not to bring his sister, which is a reasonable boundary given the context and her feelings.
- No one has acted in a way that is clearly wrong or inconsiderate yet; the boyfriend’s suggestion is not malicious, and the author’s feelings are valid.

Final Answer: Everybody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **S & K's Fault:**  
   - S & K have been using both garage spots exclusively for three years, despite all roommates paying equal rent.  
   - S misrepresented the situation by telling you they paid extra for the garage, when in fact they only paid for the openers, not for exclusive use of the spots.  
   - They did not offer to share or rotate the garage spots, even though you have had to deal with the inconvenience and safety risks of street parking.

2. **Your Fault:**  
   - You withheld the garage door opener as leverage, rather than returning it immediately or discussing the situation openly.  
   - You are now insisting on exclusive use of a spot for yourself, rather than proposing a fair rotation or sharing system, which could be seen as overcorrecting the previous unfairness.

3. **Shared Fault:**  
   - The core issue is a lack of clear, fair communication and agreement among all roommates about how the garage should be used, given that everyone pays the same rent.  
   - Both sides have acted in self-interest without establishing a transparent, equitable arrangement.

4. **Not at Fault:**

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Background:** The author has been taken advantage of for years by family for free tech support, which escalated to unreasonable expectations and even being volunteered to strangers. The author set boundaries, which were repeatedly ignored or disrespected by some family members.

2. **Immediate Situation:** At a family event, after being assured he wouldn't be asked for tech support, the author overheard a relative (aunt) making a loud, passive-aggressive comment about him not helping with her laptop. This was clearly meant to provoke or shame him.

3. **Author's Response:** The author ""lost his cool,"" stormed into the room, and delivered a harsh, expletive-laden tirade, including personal insults and name-calling, before leaving the event.

4. **Aftermath:** Some family members sympathize with the author’s frustration and past treatment, but many believe the outburst was inappropriate and that an apology is warranted for the way the author expressed himself, not necessarily for the underlying grievance.

5. **Fault Analysis:**
   - The aunt was rude, entitled, and disrespectful, but her behavior was passive-aggressive and verbal.
   - The author, while justified in being upset, escalated the situation by responding with a personal, aggressive, and vulgar attack in front of others, which is generally considered unacceptable regardless of provocation.

6. **Conclusion:** While the aunt’s behavior was wrong, the author’s reaction crossed a line into personal attack and public humiliation, which is disproportionate and inappropriate. The author is at fault for the manner of the response, even if the underlying frustration is justified.

**Therefore, the author is at fault for the outburst, even though the aunt’s behavior was also bad.**",stop,1577,374,1951

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault here. While it is absolutely acceptable to end a relationship or friendship if you no longer enjoy someone's company, the way the author handled the situation is problematic. Instead of being honest and direct (while still being kind), the author chose to lie about having ""issues"" as an excuse to cut off contact, while making it clear they would still be socializing with mutual friends and frequenting the same places. This is misleading and unnecessarily hurtful, as it avoids giving the other person closure or a truthful explanation. The author admits to lying to avoid an uncomfortable conversation, prioritizing their own comfort over the other person's feelings.

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault here. While it is understandable that he wanted to be practical and save money, reusing an engagement ring from a previous relationship—especially without telling his new fiancée beforehand—can be seen as insensitive. Engagement rings are highly symbolic, and many people would feel hurt or undervalued to receive a ring that was originally intended for someone else. The author should have communicated openly with his fiancée about the ring’s history before proposing. The ex’s actions may have been meddlesome, but the core issue is the author’s lack of transparency and consideration for his fiancée’s feelings.",stop,652,140,792

**Reasoning:**  
You are clearly passionate about blood donation, and your motivation is understandable given your family history. However, in this situation, you judged your friends harshly for not donating and attributed their decision to ""negligence and laziness,"" despite their right to make personal choices about their bodies and time. While your intentions were to encourage a good cause, your approach was accusatory and dismissive of their autonomy, which led to conflict and accusations of having a ""superiority complex."" 

Your friends are not obligated to share your level of passion or your reasons for donating, and it's not fair to label them negatively for making a different choice, especially when blood donation is voluntary.

Final Answer: Author

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   The author describes being rejected by women and, as a result, immediately cutting off all contact with them. When confronted by a friend of a woman he blocked, he is told he is immature and doesn't value her. The author feels justified in his actions and is frustrated by the negative reaction he receives.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The author is not obligated to remain friends with someone who rejects him romantically. It is understandable to need space after rejection.
   - However, the author’s language and attitude reveal a lack of empathy and respect for the other person’s feelings. He refers to women as ""lost causes"" and equates rejection with being ""shitted on"" or ""assfucked,"" which is disrespectful and objectifying.
   - The author also generalizes all women based on his negative experiences, which is unfair and problematic.
   - Blocking someone everywhere immediately after rejection, especially if there was a prior friendship, can be seen as immature and hurtful, especially if done without explanation.
   - The author is dismissive of the idea that women might value his friendship, and he frames their desire for continued connection as entitlement.

3. **Other Parties:**  
   - The friend who confronted the author may have been harsh, but their criticism (immaturity, not valuing the woman) is not unfounded given the author’s behavior and attitude.
   - The woman who rejected the author did nothing wrong; rejection is a normal part of life and she is not obligated to reciprocate romantic feelings.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The author’s reaction to rejection—immediately cutting off and blocking people, using harsh and objectifying language, and refusing to consider the feelings of others—shows a lack of maturity and empathy. While it is okay to need space, the way the author handles it and the attitude he displays are at fault.

While it's understandable to be surprised by aspects of a partner's public performance, the author overstepped by telling his girlfriend what she ""should"" or ""shouldn't"" do in her gymnastics routine, especially when it's a routine developed with coaches and is standard in the sport. Comparing her routine to stripping and insisting it's his ""job to look out for her"" is patronizing and disrespectful of her autonomy and expertise.

1. **Initial Incident**: Your friend photoshopped your face into things and used an unflattering photo of you, despite knowing you were insecure about it. You didn't object at the time, but later told him you hated the picture.

2. **Escalation**: He sent the template (the unflattering photo) in a new group chat that included your crush, knowing you were sensitive about it. The group then spread the photo further.

3. **Your Response**: In anger, you revealed the name of your friend's crush in the group chat as retaliation, then deleted the message.

4. **Aftermath**: Most friends think you were wrong for revealing the crush's name, but one friend thinks your action was justified.

**Fault Analysis:**
- Your friend is at fault for knowingly embarrassing you and disregarding your feelings, especially in front of your crush.
- The group is at fault for spreading the photo further, amplifying your embarrassment.
- You are at fault for retaliating by revealing sensitive information about your friend, even if you deleted it quickly.

**Conclusion:**  
Both you and your friend (and to some extent, the group) acted in ways that hurt each other. Your friend's actions were the initial and more severe provocation, but your retaliation was also a breach of trust.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author describes a situation where their partner is rude and aggressive toward a delivery driver and the restaurant staff over a late food delivery.
- The author expresses embarrassment and upset at their partner's behavior, and only ""snaps"" in response to defend the delivery driver.
- The partner is the one who escalates the situation, berates the delivery driver, and continues to complain, even after the author tries to de-escalate.
- The author’s actions (getting upset, defending the delivery driver, and removing themselves from the situation) are reasonable and not at fault.
- The delivery driver and restaurant are not at fault for the partner's behavior.
- The partner is clearly the one at fault for being rude, unreasonable, and making the situation worse.

- Both parties are engaging in questionable behavior: the mother for taking without asking, and the author for being upset despite benefiting from her generosity in the past.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**
Step by step:

1. **Resetting the iPad:** Resetting a device before gifting it, especially to a child, is standard and responsible. It protects privacy and gives the new user a fresh start. The author and her husband acted appropriately.

2. **Brother-in-law’s Reaction:** The brother-in-law’s response was disproportionate and rude. Yelling, demanding immediate fixes, and leaving aggressive messages is not reasonable behavior, especially over a minor inconvenience like re-downloading games.

3. **Pattern of Behavior:** The brother-in-law and his wife have a history of being ungrateful and demanding (complaints about gifts, money, not attending events, etc.), while the author and her husband have made reasonable efforts (sending gifts, money, school books).

4. **Communication:** The author and her husband have tried to communicate and resolve issues, but are met with hostility and blame.

5. **Impact on the Child:** While it’s unfortunate the child is caught in the middle, the parents are responsible for mediating that relationship, not the author and her husband.

6. **Other Godparent:** The fact that another godparent also broke off contact suggests a pattern of problematic behavior from the brother-in-law and his wife.

**Conclusion:**  
The author and her husband are not at fault. The brother-in-law and his wife are at fault for their unreasonable, aggressive, and ungrateful behavior. The author’s concern about future family gatherings is valid, but the fault for the drama lies with the brother-in-law and his wife.

**Advice:**  
It is reasonable to set boundaries with toxic family members, especially to protect your own well-being (and that of your unborn child). If you wish to maintain a relationship with the nephew, you could try to send cards or small gifts directly to him, but it may not be possible to avoid the parents’ interference.

- They are saving for a wedding from a separate fund, not taking away from emergency or essential family funds.
- Wanting a traditional wedding is a personal choice and does not inherently harm anyone, especially since their daughter's needs are being met.
- The parents' opinion is based on their own values, but the couple is not being irresponsible or selfish in a way that negatively impacts their child.

3. **Your teacher informed your parents about the missing homework.**
4. **Your parents became upset with you.**
5. **You sent an emotional, somewhat disrespectful email to your teacher.**
6. **Your teacher reported the email to your parents, who became even more upset.**

**Step-by-step analysis:**

- **Your initial inability to do homework:** This is understandable given the traumatic event. However, you did not communicate with your teacher before the assignment was due to explain your situation or ask for an extension.
- **Teacher giving a 0:** Teachers often have policies about late or missing work. Without prior communication, the teacher followed standard procedure.
- **Teacher telling your parents:** This is a common practice for missing assignments, especially in middle/high school.
- **Your email:** While your feelings are valid, the tone of your email was disrespectful and accusatory. This is not an appropriate way to communicate with a teacher, even if you are upset.
- **Teacher reporting the email:** Given the tone, it is not surprising the teacher escalated the issue.

**Who is at fault?**
- The teacher followed standard procedures for missing work and communication with parents.
- Your parents' reaction is based on the information they received.
- You are responsible for not communicating your situation in advance and for sending a disrespectful email.

- The friend continued to use the author's intro after being told not to, and uploaded a video containing the intro and other uncredited, allegedly stolen content.
- The author considered filing a DMCA takedown for the unauthorized use of their intro.
- The friend's actions (spreading lies, using the intro without permission, uploading uncredited/stolen content) are clearly unethical and likely violate copyright and community standards.
- The author has not yet taken any action beyond considering a DMCA, which is a legal recourse for copyright holders.
- The friends who called the author a ""dick"" for considering a DMCA are expressing an opinion, but this does not make the author at fault for the situation.

- The author is not at fault for not forgiving someone who has repeatedly harmed and threatened them, especially when the apologies are not accompanied by changed behavior.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author describes being in a class with a small group of students, including a classmate who is described in very negative terms (overweight, poor hygiene, ""perverted,"" etc.).
   - The author admits to making negative comments, gagging at the classmate's behavior, using a code name for him, and generally being unkind.
   - The author justifies their behavior by saying others do it too and that they don't use the classmate's name.
   - The author asks if this is bullying, expressing some concern but also minimizing the behavior.

2. **Analysis of Fault:**  
   - The author is engaging in repeated negative behavior toward a specific classmate, including mocking, exclusion, and public humiliation.
   - The use of a code name, making fun of the classmate's hygiene, and telling him to ""shut up"" are all classic signs of bullying, regardless of whether the classmate's name is used.
   - The fact that others may also participate does not absolve the author of responsibility for their own actions.
   - The author recognizes that their behavior is ""not nice"" and that others react negatively to it, indicating some awareness of wrongdoing.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for bullying behavior, regardless of the classmate's own actions or the participation of others.
   - The question is about whether the author's behavior constitutes bullying and who is at fault for it. Based on the description, the author is responsible for their own actions.

- The mother dismisses the niece's feelings, calling her a ""drama queen,"" which further invalidates the niece's autonomy and emotional response.
- The author recognizes after the fact that this was wrong and is willing to apologize, which is positive, but still participated in the act.
- The nieces (the one restrained and the other present) were both upset, indicating the action had a negative impact.

Conclusion: Both adults (the author and the sister) are at fault for violating the niece's bodily autonomy and dismissing her feelings. The nieces are not at fault.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the information provided, the author describes a relationship where he felt consistently distrusted by his partner despite not giving her any reason to doubt his fidelity. He reports that he never cheated, always treated her well, and was transparent in his actions. The conflict seems to stem from his ex-girlfriend's insecurities and lack of trust, which ultimately led to the end of the relationship.

The author is asking if he is at fault (""IATA"") for wanting trust in a long-term relationship. Wanting trust is a reasonable expectation, and there is no evidence in the story that the author acted inappropriately or maliciously. The breakup appears to be the result of incompatible expectations and unresolved trust issues, not a clear fault or wrongdoing by either party.

Therefore, in this situation, **nobody is strictly ""at fault""**—it is a case of incompatibility and unmet emotional needs rather than a clear moral or ethical failing.",stop,465,207,672

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is upset about losing a trivia game with their mom, especially because the categories favored the mom's knowledge.
- The author asked the mom to ""let"" them have certain questions, but the mom played competitively and did not do so.
- The author became visibly upset, disengaged from the game, and eventually threw the controller and left.
- The mom felt guilty and tried to make the author feel better by betting all her points at the end.

Fault analysis:
- The mom played the game by the rules and did not cheat or act maliciously. She simply played to win, which is the standard expectation in a competitive game.
- The author, however, reacted poorly to losing, disengaged, and displayed unsportsmanlike behavior (throwing the controller, sulking, etc.).
- While it is understandable to feel frustrated, the responsibility for managing those emotions and behaving appropriately lies with the author.

Therefore, the author is at fault for their reaction and behavior during and after the game.",stop,734,221,955

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author was annoyed by the subway singer, which is understandable, but the singer was not doing anything wrong or harmful—just singing in public, as many street performers do.
- The author chose to approach the singer and offer her money to stop, which is a direct insult to her and her craft, regardless of her skill level.
- The author admits to being motivated by anger and annoyance, not by any constructive intent.
- The singer was hurt and confused, indicating that the author's actions caused emotional harm.
- The author's wife and friends were embarrassed or conflicted, suggesting that the behavior was socially inappropriate.
- The author expresses no remorse and is satisfied with the outcome, prioritizing personal comfort over kindness or respect.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**
- The author intervened to protect their nephew from emotional harm and bigotry, which is a reasonable and even commendable action.
- The sister-in-law (SIL) is responsible for her own words and actions, including her bigoted comments and past abuse, but she is also struggling with addiction and mental illness, which complicates the situation.
- The author’s harsh words were a reaction to years of pain and a desire to protect a vulnerable family member, not an unprovoked attack.
- The author did not escalate to yelling or violence, and the nephew expressed gratitude for the support.
- The SIL’s pain is real, but so is the pain she has caused.
- The situation is fraught and sad, but not clearly a case of someone being “at fault” in a moral sense; it’s a complex family dynamic with trauma on all sides.

Therefore, while the author feels guilty, their actions were understandable and not malicious, and the SIL’s struggles do not excuse her behavior. This is a tragic situation, but not one where clear blame can be assigned to any one person.

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author and his girlfriend mutually agreed to celebrate Valentine's Day on a later date due to their busy schedules. This is a reasonable and considerate decision.
- The author mentioned to a mutual friend that celebrating later would save money, which is a practical observation, not inherently malicious or disrespectful.
- The mutual friend relayed this information to the girlfriend in a way that implied the author was being cheap or manipulative, which misrepresented the author's intentions and created unnecessary conflict.
- The author is now in a position where he has to defend himself and his intentions, which would not have happened if the mutual friend had not intervened inappropriately.

Therefore, the fault lies with the mutual friend (""Other"") for misrepresenting the author's intentions and causing unnecessary drama.",stop,400,170,570

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author describes a relationship where they took on all responsibilities and neglected their own needs to make their partner happy.
- The partner discouraged the author from seeing friends and insisted on constant togetherness, which is controlling behavior.
- The partner then expressed attraction to someone else and wanted a ""break"" but not a breakup, nor for the author to move out—this is emotionally manipulative and confusing.
- When the author left, the partner accused them of being a bad boyfriend and hurting her mental health, despite the partner's own actions contributing to the unhealthy dynamic.
- The author is worried about hurting her, but their actions (leaving an unhealthy situation) are reasonable and self-protective.

Conclusion: The partner's controlling and manipulative behavior is the primary cause of the unhealthy relationship dynamic and the resulting fallout. The author is not at fault for leaving.

There is no clear wrongdoing or malice from the author; rather, it is a case of someone reaching their limit in a challenging friendship.

The author describes a pattern of abusive, harmful, and violent behavior toward multiple partners, including cheating, stalking, physical violence (bruising, hitting, choking), and emotional manipulation. The author acknowledges these actions, expresses some remorse, and claims to have improved, but the responsibility for the harm caused lies squarely with the author. While the author suggests that one partner ""brought out the worst"" in him and that she ""became abusive,"" this does not excuse or mitigate his own actions, especially given the repeated and escalating nature of his behavior.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation described, the author’s ex-girlfriend engaged in inappropriate behavior by flirting with the author's friends and asking them intimate questions while still in a relationship. After breaking up, the author simply told others the truth about why the relationship ended when asked, without spreading false information or malicious rumors. The ex-girlfriend then responded by insulting the author and blaming him for her own social difficulties, despite the author asking others to stop giving her a hard time.

The author’s actions—answering honestly when asked and discouraging harassment—do not constitute fault. The ex-girlfriend’s actions (flirting with others while in a relationship, breaking up without explanation, insulting the author, and blaming him for her own actions) are the primary cause of the conflict.

Therefore, the ex-girlfriend (Other) is at fault.",stop,476,187,663

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The author is frustrated with their friend's constant discussion and social media posting about law school, and feels unsupported or even condescended to when discussing their own law school ambitions.
2. The friend is sharing a major part of her life and possibly venting about the challenges, which is common, especially with close friends. She may not realize the extent to which her comments are affecting the author.
3. The author has not described any direct confrontation or communication about these feelings to the friend.
4. There is no evidence of malicious intent or clear wrongdoing from either party—just a mismatch in communication and emotional needs.
5. The situation is primarily about feelings, boundaries, and communication, not about clear-cut fault or wrongdoing.

Therefore, while the author is understandably frustrated, and the friend could be more sensitive, neither is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. This is a common friendship dynamic issue that could be resolved with honest communication.",stop,750,209,959

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is frustrated because their parents rely on them for basic IT support and refuse to learn, despite repeated encouragement to be more independent.
- The parents are at fault for not making an effort to learn basic skills and for guilt-tripping the author into continued help, rather than respecting boundaries.
- The author, while justified in their frustration, did eventually give in to guilt and resume helping, which may have reinforced the parents' behavior, but this is a minor fault compared to the parents' refusal to learn.
- The brother also avoids responsibility by pretending to be tech illiterate, contributing to the burden on the author.
- Overall, the situation is a result of family dynamics where everyone plays a part: the parents for not learning, the brother for avoiding, and the author for not maintaining boundaries (though under pressure).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author describes a long-term friendship with ""A"" who repeatedly disrespects boundaries, damages property, is inconsiderate with time, and blames all negative behavior on ADHD.
   - The author has communicated their needs and feelings multiple times, but ""A"" does not change her behavior or take responsibility.
   - The author finally cuts off the friendship after a particularly inconsiderate incident.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The author is not at fault for having boundaries, communicating them, and expecting respect.
   - ""A"" is at fault for repeatedly disregarding the author's boundaries, causing financial and emotional harm, and refusing to take responsibility for her actions.
   - ADHD can explain some behaviors (forgetfulness, lateness), but it does not excuse repeated disregard for others' property, feelings, or boundaries, especially after being told multiple times.
   - The author made efforts to accommodate and communicate, and only ended the friendship after a long pattern of disrespect.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is not being insensitive; they are justified in feeling used and in ending the friendship.
   - The fault lies with ""A"" for her repeated inconsiderate actions and refusal to take responsibility.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation summary:**  
   - The author and their aunt have a long-standing, antagonistic relationship.
   - The aunt, who is obese, recently completed a hike and was proud of it, sharing her experience at a family dinner.
   - The aunt made some dismissive comments about the author's fitness achievements.
   - The author responded by insulting the aunt and her friends, referencing their weight and mocking their accomplishment.
   - The aunt accused the author of fat shaming and left the room upset.
   - The family thinks the author should apologize.

2. **Fault analysis:**  
   - The aunt was arguably rude and condescending by minimizing the author's fitness achievements and acting as an authority after one hike.
   - However, the author's response escalated the situation by making personal, derogatory, and fat-shaming remarks (""pig friends,"" referencing being passed by grandmas and toddlers, etc.).
   - The author's reaction was disproportionate and targeted the aunt's weight and self-esteem, which is generally considered unacceptable and hurtful behavior.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - While the aunt was rude, the author's response crossed a line into personal attacks and fat shaming.
   - The author is primarily at fault for the escalation and the nature of their comments.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Context:** The author is recounting a conversation with their friend Sam, who uses they/them pronouns and is dating someone who also uses they/them pronouns but presents as a man and has ""male parts."" The author, in an attempt to be cheeky, makes a comment: ""jumping back on that dick again, eh.""

2. **Intent vs. Impact:** The author claims the comment was meant literally, referencing Sam's sexual history. However, the impact of the comment was that Sam found it transphobic and bigoted.

3. **Why the comment is problematic:** The comment reduces Sam's new partner to their genitalia, which is a common microaggression against trans and non-binary people. It also disregards the partner's pronouns and identity, focusing instead on anatomy, which is often considered disrespectful in LGBTQ+ communities.

4. **Responsibility:** While the author did not intend harm, intent does not negate impact. The author acknowledges the comment was ""tone deaf"" and apologizes, but the harm was done.

5. **Sam's reaction:** Sam is hurt and the friendship is damaged. While some might argue Sam could have been more forgiving, the primary fault lies with the author for making a comment that was insensitive and could be interpreted as transphobic.

6. **Conclusion:** The author is at fault for making a comment that was inappropriate and hurtful, regardless of intent. The situation could have been avoided with more sensitivity and awareness.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Assessing the Author's Actions:**  
   - The author developed feelings for a friend who was in a relationship, but did not act on them until after he said he was single.
   - When the friend initiated flirtation and sexting, the author reciprocated, believing he was single and interested.
   - The author communicated openly about her feelings and concerns (e.g., asking if she was a rebound, asking for space when hurt).
   - When the friend became distant and unreliable, the author set boundaries (blocking him, refusing to meet).
   - The author did not harass, manipulate, or mistreat the friend.

2. **Assessing the Friend's Actions:**  
   - The friend initiated flirtation and sexting after his breakup.
   - He was emotionally inconsistent, sometimes distant, and not always supportive (e.g., slow to respond about the author's sick mother).
   - He did not respect the author's boundaries (showing up at her university after she said no).
   - However, his actions, while inconsiderate and boundary-pushing, do not rise to the level of clear malice or abuse.

3. **Fault Assessment:**  
   - The author acted reasonably, communicated her needs, and set boundaries when hurt.
   - The friend was inconsiderate and disrespectful of boundaries, but not to a degree that would make him solely ""at fault"" in a way that the question seems to be asking (i.e., ""Am I the asshole?"").
   - The situation is one of mismatched expectations, poor communication, and emotional immaturity, but not clear wrongdoing.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is **not** at fault.
   - The friend is inconsiderate, but not to the point of being solely at fault for the situation.
   - This is a case of a messy, emotionally complicated friendship/relationship, but not one where anyone is truly ""the asshole.""

2. **Author's actions:** The author admits to snooping through her private messages without her consent, which is a violation of privacy. Additionally, he encouraged her to move closer, possibly without being fully honest about his feelings or intentions, and then broke up with her soon after.

3. **Communication issues:** Both parties failed to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings and concerns. The author suppressed his doubts and acted as if everything was fine, while the girlfriend was not transparent about her ongoing feelings for her ex.

4. **Breakup timing:** The author broke up with her after she moved, which understandably upset her, as she may feel misled or that her move was for nothing.

- The author reacts emotionally, yelling about her feelings of being overshadowed.
- While the author’s reaction is emotional, it is understandable given the context and her feelings of being neglected.
- The parents are not intentionally dismissing the author’s needs; they are dealing with practical constraints and exhaustion.
- There is no clear malicious intent or gross negligence from any party; rather, this is a difficult family dynamic with understandable frustrations on both sides.

Therefore, while communication could be improved, nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a moral sense—this is a situation of conflicting needs and emotional stress, not wrongdoing.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Based on your description, the primary responsibility for the children's well-being and education lies with their parents, especially since they are minors. You have been away for military service and are now an adult living independently. The toxic family environment, lack of consistent discipline, and undermining of parental authority (especially by your father) are the root causes of the problem. While it is understandable to feel some responsibility as an older sibling, you are not at fault for not being able to fix a situation that is fundamentally the parents' responsibility and has been ongoing for years. The children themselves are also minors and are being failed by the adults in their lives. Therefore, the fault lies with ""Other"" (the parents, especially the father), not you.",stop,719,165,884

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is curious about the price of a gift, which is a natural human reaction and not inherently wrong.
- The SO chose not to disclose the price, which is also reasonable, as some people prefer to keep gift prices private.
- The author is concerned about hurting their SO's feelings, showing consideration.
- No action has been taken yet that would directly hurt anyone.
- There is no evidence of malice, disrespect, or violation of trust so far.

**Reasoning:**
- The author knowingly lied about being pregnant to manipulate her boyfriend into coming back and recommitting to the relationship.
- She then compounded the lie by faking a miscarriage and allowing her partner to grieve a child that never existed.
- While the boyfriend's initial reaction to the previous ""baby scare"" was to break up, that was based on his own emotional state and not a deception.
- The author’s actions were a clear breach of trust and emotional manipulation, which are significant ethical violations in a relationship.
- The subsequent happiness and stability of their marriage and family do not erase the original wrongdoing.

The author left because they couldn't sleep due to snoring, which is a reasonable and honest response, especially given their early work schedule and responsibilities. They communicated their reason and even suggested possible solutions for the future (ear plugs, etc.).

This is a situation involving complex feelings, communication, and boundaries between two people. The author was honest about their feelings and tried to respect the other person's space after being blocked. The girl may have been unsure of her own feelings, gave mixed signals, and ultimately decided to cut off contact when she felt uncomfortable. While her actions (blocking without explanation, mixed signals) may have been confusing and hurtful, she is not necessarily ""at fault"" for not reciprocating feelings or for needing space. The author, while persistent, did not cross any clear boundaries after being blocked and tried to get closure through a friend, which is understandable but not malicious.

Both parties are navigating difficult emotions and social dynamics, but there is no clear wrongdoing or malice. This is a case of miscommunication and mismatched expectations, not fault.",stop,719,182,901

Final Answer: Everybody

Step by step reasoning:

1. **Author's feelings and actions:** The author is feeling betrayed and hostile, but hasn't acted on those feelings. The author is also on a break with their partner, and there is no indication of a current exclusive relationship. The author admits to feeling like ""an asshole"" (AITA = Am I The Asshole?), but mainly for their feelings, not actions.

2. **Friend's actions:** The friend, who is close to both the author and the author's partner, has developed feelings for the partner and is pursuing them. The author feels this is a betrayal, especially since the friend made everyone believe he was gay, which may have influenced trust and boundaries.

3. **Partner's actions:** There is no evidence that the partner is reciprocating the friend's feelings or acting inappropriately, based on the information given.

4. **Fault assessment:** 
   - The friend is at fault for pursuing the author's partner, especially given the close relationships and the sensitive situation.
   - The author is at fault for harboring hostility and possibly for not communicating openly, but hasn't acted on these feelings.
   - The partner does not appear to be at fault based on the information provided.

5. **Conclusion:** Both the author and the friend share some responsibility for the tension and feelings of betrayal, though the friend's actions are more directly problematic. The partner does not seem to be at fault. Since the author and the friend both contribute to the situation, ""Everybody"" (meaning both the author and the friend) is the most accurate answer.",stop,413,327,740

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The husband is a musician and wants to introduce their 4-year-old daughter to music, including giving her an instrument to learn.
   - The author is hesitant, feeling it might be ""forcing"" music on the child and wants to wait until the child is older to choose her own interests.
   - The daughter has been exposed to music and has shown interest in learning an instrument, having picked one after being introduced to several.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The husband is not forcing a specific instrument or music on the child; he is exposing her to options and letting her choose.
   - The child has expressed interest in learning an instrument.
   - The author is objecting to the child starting music at a young age, despite the child’s interest and the husband’s reasonable approach.

3. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The husband is not at fault, as he is encouraging and supporting the child’s interest, not forcing it.
   - The child is not at fault, as she is simply expressing her interest.
   - The author is at fault for potentially stifling the child’s interest and the husband’s reasonable encouragement, based on a fear of ""forcing"" that is not supported by the facts presented.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for being unreasonably hesitant and potentially blocking a positive, interest-led opportunity for the child.

**Confidence:** High, as the facts indicate the child is interested and the husband is not being forceful.

- The account owner responded rudely, but did not ask for help.
- The author then took control of the account by changing the password and deleting the recovery phone number, effectively locking the owner out of their own account.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author refused to wear a mask in a hospital setting, despite being asked by a nurse and being told it was to protect vulnerable patients. The author’s reasoning is based on personal immunity and a lack of legal obligation, disregarding public health guidelines and the well-being of others. The nurse was following hospital policy and acting in the interest of patient safety. The author also acknowledges being rude to the nurse.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author (you) declined to take drugs, expressed discomfort with the situation, and communicated your boundaries.
- The girlfriend wanted to party, dance, and experiment with drugs, which is her choice, though it may be concerning to you.
- Both of you argued, but neither person did anything egregiously wrong or malicious; it was a clash of boundaries, expectations, and communication under the influence of alcohol and a party environment.
- The situation escalated due to stress, intoxication, and differing desires for the night, not because of clear wrongdoing.
- There is no evidence of anyone intentionally harming the other, just a difficult night and poor communication.

1. **Initial Agreement:**  
   - You offered to refer him and split the bonus 50/50.  
   - He explicitly refused, saying he didn’t want any bonus, just the job.

2. **Subsequent Interactions:**  
   - You offered to help him with interview info, and he agreed to hang out instead.  
   - No new agreement about splitting the bonus was made.

3. **After Hiring:**  
   - At the party, he brought up splitting the bonus, but you did not explicitly agree, only said “let’s see as soon as the money comes.”

4. **When Bonus Arrives:**  
   - You decide not to split, based on the original refusal and your plans for the money.

5. **Principle:**  
   - You are standing by the original arrangement, which was that he did not want the bonus.

Setting a clear, non-confrontational boundary (even if it means pulling over) is reasonable for your own comfort and safety.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**
- The author has a diagnosed mental health condition (OCD) that makes it extremely difficult to eat food they perceive as contaminated, especially by germs.
- The husband burped directly onto the author's food without covering his mouth or turning away, which is generally considered impolite and unsanitary, regardless of OCD.
- The author did not make a scene or blame the husband, but simply could not eat the food due to their condition.
- The husband's reaction—getting angry, demanding the author eat the food, and making hurtful comments—shows a lack of empathy and understanding, especially given the author's known struggles.
- While the husband may not have intended to burp, he could have apologized and been more understanding, especially after being asked to cover his mouth in the future.

- The author intentionally kept this lunch secret from his wife and son, knowing they would disapprove.

- The son is upset after finding out.

**Who is at fault?**
- The author knowingly went against the wishes of his son and wife, and intentionally kept them in the dark.
- The author is the one who made the decision and orchestrated the situation.
- The ex-wife was simply invited; she did not initiate or hide anything.
- The son and wife were not involved in the decision.

- The situation is clear: the author acted against the known wishes of his family and kept it secret.

   - The author is clear and upfront about their preferences, communicating politely and repeatedly that they do not want gifts except for specific consumables.
   - The author is not rude in their communication and tries to be considerate in their responses, even when disappointed.
   - The author’s frustration is internal; outwardly, they remain polite and grateful.

2. **Others’ Behavior (Family, Girlfriend):**  
   - The family and girlfriend continue to give gifts that do not align with the author’s stated preferences.
   - Their intentions are good—they want to show affection and care through gift-giving, a common social practice.
   - They may be ignoring or not fully understanding the author’s wishes, but their actions are not malicious.

3. **Fault Assessment:**  
   - The author is not at fault for having clear preferences and communicating them.
   - The family and girlfriend are not at fault for wanting to express love and care, even if they miss the mark.
   - There is a mismatch in communication and love languages, but no one is acting out of malice or disrespect.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The author’s boyfriend was seated far away from her, with strangers and the photographer, despite being in a long-term relationship and known to the bride.
- The best man’s wife was seated next to him, showing that couples were not universally separated.
- The author only left her seat after the food was served, not during a key moment, and did so to support her boyfriend who was left out.
- The seating arrangement was the responsibility of the bride (or whoever planned the wedding), and it was inconsiderate to isolate the author’s boyfriend.
- The author’s actions were a response to a situation created by others, not a breach of etiquette or duty.

- Leaving 45s on the bar assumes the next person will want to start with that weight, but not everyone does (e.g., beginners, people doing different exercises, or warm-up sets).
- The other person was correct in expecting the bar to be cleared, as this is the standard in most gyms.
- The fact that there are other benches available is irrelevant to the etiquette for each station.
- The author’s intention was considerate, but it goes against the more widely accepted gym norm.

- While relationships require compromise, asking someone to jeopardize their education and future opportunities for personal time is unreasonable.

- **Your husband** is at fault for emotionally abusing you, sharing private details about your relationship with others (including business partners), lying to you about it, and creating a hostile environment both at home and at work. His actions are a significant breach of trust and privacy, and they have contributed to your isolation and distress.
- **You (the author)** are at fault for breaching his privacy by logging into his email without consent. While your suspicions were justified given the circumstances, accessing someone’s private communications without permission is still a violation of trust and privacy.
- **The business partners/team** may also bear some responsibility if they participated in the social isolation or mistreatment based on one-sided information, though this is less clear from the information provided.

Given the complexity and the mutual breaches of trust and privacy, **both you and your husband have made serious mistakes**. The situation is the result of a breakdown in communication, boundaries, and respect on both sides.

- The flight attendants making jokes about delays in front of frustrated passengers is unprofessional and insensitive.
- The author admits to being ""immature"" and ""bolder"" with complaints, which may have contributed to the tension, but their frustration is understandable given the circumstances.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author (23m) is dating an 18f who has a history of eating disorders and body image issues.
   - She is in therapy and on medication, but her insecurities persist, affecting their intimacy.
   - The author feels sexually frustrated and has asked her to ""make an effort"" to be more physically intimate.
   - She cried, saying that being pressured makes things worse.
   - The author does not believe he is pressuring her and is asking if he is the ""asshole.""

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The girlfriend is actively seeking help (therapy, medication) and has a history of trauma.
   - The author is expressing his needs, but is also pushing her to change at a pace she is not comfortable with.
   - He admits to being frustrated and to having ""sat her down"" to ask her to ""make an effort,"" despite her clear distress and communication that pressure is harmful.
   - The author is prioritizing his sexual frustration over her mental health and recovery process.

3. **Ethical Considerations:**  
   - Pressuring someone with a history of trauma and current mental health struggles to be physically intimate, even if unintentionally, is harmful.
   - The author’s actions, even if not malicious, are not supportive or respectful of her boundaries and healing process.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for not respecting her boundaries and for pressuring her, even after she communicated that it makes things worse.
   - The girlfriend is not at fault; she is dealing with significant issues and is seeking help.

1. **You (the author) have a long-standing, positive relationship with your tattoo artist.**
2. **During your last session, you experienced significant physical distress (shaking, near fainting), which you communicated to your artist.**
3. **You asked to stop the session for your health and safety.**
4. **Your artist pressured you to continue, expressing excitement but not prioritizing your well-being.**
5. **Another artist made a mocking, unsupportive comment, further making you uncomfortable.**
6. **You left feeling physically and emotionally unwell, and now you’re considering canceling your next appointment.**

**Who is at fault?**
- You are not at fault for listening to your body and prioritizing your health.
- Your artist, while perhaps disappointed, should have respected your boundaries without pressure.
- The other artist was clearly out of line for mocking you in a vulnerable moment.
- Feeling bad about the situation is a normal emotional response, not a fault.
- Canceling an appointment for your own well-being is within your rights as a client.

**Conclusion:**  
The fault lies with the other people involved (the tattoo artist for pressuring you, and especially the other artist for mocking you). You are not at fault for your feelings or for considering canceling.

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault here primarily for how they communicated their feelings. While it's reasonable to have personal preferences about jewelry and the symbolism of promise rings, the way the author expressed their opinion (""promise rings are a stupid idea and kinda childish"") was dismissive and hurtful to their girlfriend, who gave the ring as a meaningful gesture. Instead of having an open, empathetic conversation about their feelings, the author avoided the topic and then responded bluntly, which understandably upset their girlfriend.

Having reservations or fears about a situation does not make you at fault. You haven't actually done anything wrong—you're just expressing your feelings and concerns.

The author is at fault here. While it's understandable to want personal time and to use gaming as a way to relieve stress, moving in together changes the dynamics of a relationship. The author is not making an effort to adjust to the new living situation or to meet their partner's reasonable expectations for attention and shared time during the week. Simply being physically present in the same space is not the same as spending quality time together. The author is prioritizing their own interests without compromise, despite knowing their partner's needs have changed. Communication and compromise are key in relationships, especially after a significant change like moving in together.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is concerned about their friend's relationship dynamics, perceiving that Evan may be taking advantage of their friend's kindness and possibly exhibiting some misogynistic attitudes.
- The author expresses their concern, which leads to an argument with their friend, who defends Evan and insists she is happy.
- Evan's behavior, as described, may be problematic, but the friend does not seem to feel oppressed or unhappy, at least from her own perspective.
- The author is acting out of concern, not malice, and the friend is defending her own choices.
- There is no clear wrongdoing or malice from any party; rather, this is a case of differing perspectives and values.
- The situation is more about boundaries and differing views on relationships than about clear fault.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is a young person who has been helping care for their bedridden grandfather for three years, which is a significant responsibility.
- On this particular day, the author was especially tired due to a change in schedule (having to leave earlier because of their brother), resulting in less sleep.
- The author fell asleep at their grandparents' house and was unable to help their grandmother when called, which led to the grandmother becoming very upset and using harsh language.
- The author feels unappreciated and hurt by the grandmother's reaction, especially given their history of helping.
- The grandmother may be under significant stress herself, caring for a spouse with severe health issues and possibly dealing with her own emotional or cognitive challenges.
- There is no clear evidence of malice or neglect from either party; rather, both seem to be under strain and reacted emotionally in a difficult situation.

Given the context, it appears to be a situation where stress, exhaustion, and miscommunication led to hurt feelings, but no one is truly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. Both parties are struggling, and the conflict arose from understandable human limitations rather than wrongdoing.

- The friend has developed a new speech pattern, possibly unintentionally or due to a medical or psychological reason. There is no indication that the friend is doing this to annoy the author.
- The author is struggling with how to handle the situation without being rude or hurting their friend, and is seeking advice rather than acting maliciously.
- Avoiding the friend is a coping mechanism, not an act of malice.

These actions are unethical, unprofessional, and potentially illegal. While the author admits to arguing and cursing back, this was in response to being mistreated and does not rise to the same level of fault as the driver's actions.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Recap:**  
   - A friend posts about a new car on Snapchat shortly after a devastating fire in the community.
   - The author messages the friend, suggesting she wait to post because it might be insensitive to those who lost cars.
   - The friend is offended, says the author shouldn't speak for those affected, and feels accused of being insensitive.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The friend who posted about the car was not directly affected by the fire, nor was the author.
   - The author intervened, suggesting the friend change her behavior for the sake of others, even though the author was not directly affected.
   - The friend felt policed and misunderstood, and the author admits to not being directly affected.

3. **Social Norms:**  
   - It is not inherently wrong to post about personal good news, even after a tragedy, unless it is done in a gloating or insensitive manner.
   - The author’s message, while intended to be considerate, could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author was not directly affected and was presuming to speak for those who were.

4. **Intent vs. Impact:**  
   - The author’s intent was to be considerate, but the impact was to make the friend feel judged and policed.
   - The friend’s reaction, while defensive, is understandable given the context.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for overstepping and policing the friend’s behavior, especially since the author was not directly affected and the friend’s post was not overtly insensitive.

- The family disagreed with the author, perceiving the comment as unnecessarily mean or harsh.
- The author feels misunderstood and wonders if they should change their communication style.
- The core issue is the author's comment, which was not received well because it was seen as overly critical.
- The bakery worker made a minor mistake, but it does not rise to the level of fault that would justify firing.

- The wife expresses discomfort with dirty dishes being left overnight and asks if they will be done before she wakes up.
- The author responds dismissively (""Get over yourself"") rather than acknowledging her feelings or trying to find a compromise.
- The wife proceeds to do the dishes herself, and the author tells her to stop, but she continues.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is making an adoption decision based on personal beliefs, specifically excluding gay couples as potential adoptive parents.
- While the author has the legal right to express preferences in adoption, the reasoning given is rooted in personal bias and stereotypes (concern about bullying, but not considering that children of single parents or other non-traditional families may also face challenges).
- Preferring a heterosexual married couple and explicitly excluding gay couples, even if couched in concern for the child, perpetuates discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and families.
- The author’s family and friends believe this is unreasonable, suggesting a social consensus that this preference is unfair or prejudiced.
- The question is about fault, not legality. The author is at fault for allowing personal bias to dictate a discriminatory preference in a situation that affects others’ rights and opportunities.

1. **The girl** is in a relationship but emotionally engages with the author, expressing romantic feelings and leading him on, while not breaking up with her boyfriend. She initiates contact, expresses love, and gives mixed signals.

2. **The author** develops feelings, reciprocates, and tries to clarify the situation. He pushes for honesty and a decision, but also continues to engage despite knowing she is in a relationship. When he feels used, he contacts her boyfriend to reveal her actions, partly out of hurt and partly out of a sense of justice.

3. **The boyfriend** is unaware and is being deceived.

4. **The brother** is not directly involved in the romantic/ethical aspects.

**Fault Analysis:**
- The girl is at fault for emotionally cheating and leading on both the author and her boyfriend.
- The author is at fault for continuing to engage in a romantic way with someone in a relationship, and for contacting the boyfriend out of spite.
- The boyfriend is a victim.
- The brother is not at fault.

**Conclusion:** Both the author and the girl share responsibility for the emotional mess and the hurt caused. The author’s final action (contacting the boyfriend) was motivated by hurt and revenge, which is ethically questionable, even if the boyfriend had a right to know.

2. **Your Dilemma**: You wonder if you would be wrong (WIBTA = Would I Be The Asshole) not to offer the clothes to your brother and SIL, or if you should offer them with the condition that they be returned if not wanted.

3. **Fault Analysis**:
   - **You (Author)**: You are not at fault for wanting to preserve sentimental family items, especially given SIL’s past disinterest and your reasonable concern that she may discard or sell them.
   - **Brother/SIL**: They are not at fault for having preferences about what their child wears, even if those preferences seem picky or ungrateful to you.
   - **Mother**: She is not at fault; she simply wanted her grandchildren to enjoy the clothes.
   - **No Harm Done**: No one has acted maliciously or irresponsibly. The situation is about managing expectations and family heirlooms, not about wrongdoing.

4. **Conclusion**: This is a situation of differing values and preferences, not of fault. You are not obligated to offer the clothes, especially given the history, but it would also not be wrong to offer them with the request that they be returned if not used. No one is at fault here.

- The author is asking if they are at fault (""am I the asshole?"") for getting upset and stopping intimacy after their boyfriend repeatedly interrupted the moment to ask about the chicken nuggets.
- The author was already doing two things for their boyfriend: cooking food and giving him oral sex, both at his request.
- The boyfriend repeatedly asked about the food, even while the author was performing oral sex, which made the author feel unappreciated and like they were not doing a good job at either task.
- When the author expressed their feelings and stopped, the boyfriend gave a backhanded apology (""y'know I was right though""), which is not a genuine apology and does not acknowledge the author's feelings.
- The author did not lash out or insult the boyfriend, but simply removed themselves from the situation to process their feelings.

- The boyfriend is at fault for being inconsiderate, not appreciating the author's efforts, and giving a dismissive apology.
- The author is not at fault for expressing their feelings and setting a boundary when they felt unappreciated.

- The dog’s behavior is problematic and potentially dangerous, but dogs are not morally responsible for their actions.
- There is no clear evidence of neglect, abuse, or malice from either the author or the boyfriend.
- The situation is unfortunate and stressful, but it is not the result of clear wrongdoing by any person involved.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is frustrated with Carl for not being involved in planning and for asking for a ride at the last minute.
- Carl has reasons (moving, injury) for his lack of involvement, but still wants to join.
- The author is not saying Carl can't come, just expressing frustration at the inconvenience.
- The partner (who would be driving) is fine with Carl joining.
- Carl is not demanding, just asking if there is space and offering to chip in for gas.
- The group has not explicitly excluded Carl, nor has Carl been rude or entitled.
- The author is not at fault for feeling frustrated, nor is Carl at fault for asking late given his circumstances.
- No one is being unreasonable or malicious; it's a minor logistical annoyance, not a moral failing.

1. **John's girlfriend** took your number from his phone without telling him, to plan a surprise party. This is a bit of a privacy breach, but her intentions were good.
2. **You** agreed to help plan the party and communicated with her about it.
3. When you were with John, his girlfriend texted you about the party. You tried to hide the message to keep the surprise.
4. You told her John was with you, but she didn't believe you, so you sent her a photo of John as proof.
5. She got angry because John had lied to her about his whereabouts, called him, and then sent him the photo you took, breaking up with him.
6. John was shocked and assumed you were secretly involved with his girlfriend. He accused you both of cheating.
7. You eventually showed him the messages to clear things up, but the damage was done.

**Who is at fault?**
- **John's girlfriend**: She took your number without permission (minor privacy issue), but her main fault was overreacting to John lying about his whereabouts. Instead of calmly discussing it, she broke up with him and sent the photo, escalating the situation.
- **John**: He lied to his girlfriend about where he was, which triggered her reaction. He also jumped to conclusions about you and his girlfriend without checking the facts.
- **You (the author)**: You tried to keep the surprise and only sent the photo to prove you were with John. You didn't do anything malicious or deceitful.

**Conclusion:**  
The main conflict arose from miscommunication, lack of trust, and overreactions between John and his girlfriend. You were caught in the middle and acted in good faith.

- The ""random dude"" sat in a seat he did not have a ticket for, which is not permitted according to stadium policy and ticketing rules.
- The author politely asked the person to move, and only threatened to call security after the person refused.

**Reasoning:**

- The friend pressured the author into a friendship and then set them up with someone she knew had ""underlined issues"" (i.e., red flags or a problematic past), without disclosing this information, even when directly asked.
- After the relationship turned abusive, the friend was dismissive of the author's feelings and refused to discuss the situation, despite being the only close friend the author had in the area.
- The friend sided with her long-term friend (the ex-boyfriend) and invalidated the author's experience, even when the author needed help retrieving something from him.
- The author did not blame the friend, but simply needed support, which was not provided.
- The friend then gossiped about the author to other coworkers, further alienating the author.

Final Answer: Author

Step by step reasoning:
- The author received a friend request from someone they don't know, which can feel uncomfortable, but is not inherently ""at fault.""
- The author investigated and found that the man sends friend requests to women he doesn't know, which can be seen as suspicious or creepy, but is not necessarily a violation of any rules.
- The author then accused the man in a private message of being a creep, based on assumptions and without direct evidence of malicious intent.
- The man responded that the accusation was wrong and mean, and then blocked the author.
- While the man's behavior may be socially questionable, the author escalated the situation by directly accusing and confronting him in a hostile manner.
- The question is ""am I the asshole?"" which is asking if the author is at fault for their actions.
- Given the escalation and accusatory message without direct evidence, the author is at fault for their approach, even if the man's behavior was uncomfortable.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the Author is at fault.",stop,306,218,524

Step by step reasoning:
- The author feels disconnected from their extended family due to a long history of one-sided effort and lack of reciprocation.
- The author’s mother is upset, but her feelings are based on her own expectations and values about family, not on any wrongdoing by the author.
- The extended family has not made efforts to maintain a relationship, but there is no evidence of malice or wrongdoing—just distance and perhaps indifference.
- The author already has plans and does not feel a meaningful connection to the cousin getting married.
- Choosing not to attend a wedding due to lack of relationship and prior commitments is not inherently wrong or hurtful, especially given the context.
- No one in the situation is acting with clear malice or causing harm; it is a matter of differing expectations and emotional distance.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is considering breaking up with their girlfriend because he feels unsupported and that the relationship is one-sided.
- The girlfriend expressed her own needs and feelings, but did not seem to reciprocate support when the author was struggling.
- The author is not breaking up out of malice, but out of self-preservation and a desire for a more balanced relationship.
- Wanting to end a relationship that is not fulfilling or healthy for you is not inherently wrong or blameworthy.
- The girlfriend is not necessarily at fault for having her own needs, though her lack of support may be disappointing.
- Relationships end for many reasons, and sometimes people simply are not compatible.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**
- The author is not at fault for not being interested in Allen, nor for choosing to avoid him rather than have a direct conversation. While direct communication is often ideal, nobody is obligated to maintain a relationship or friendship they do not want, especially if the other person is being pushy and not reading signals.
- Allen is not at fault for initially being interested or for asking the author out, but he does become somewhat at fault for being pushy and not picking up on social cues. However, once he apologizes and tries to keep his distance, he seems to respect the boundary.
- The situation is awkward, but neither party is behaving in a way that is egregiously wrong or malicious. The author could have been more direct, but avoidance is a common and understandable response in uncomfortable social situations, especially on vacation.
- Therefore, while there are imperfect choices, there is no clear ""asshole"" here—just a difficult social dynamic.

- The breakup, while painful for the girlfriend, was not done with malice; the author simply chose not to explain, which is within their rights, even if it is emotionally hard for the other person.
- Blocking everyone and cutting off contact is drastic, but given the described abuse and desire for a fresh start, it is understandable and not inherently ""at fault.""
- No one else in the story is described as taking actions that would make them ""at fault"" for the situation described.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Author's Feelings**: The author is upset about being left out of the loop regarding their best friend's abuse. This is a natural emotional response, especially given the closeness of the friendship and the desire to support their friend.

2. **Friends' Actions**: The rest of the group, including the victim, chose not to tell the author, likely out of concern for how the author would react (as evidenced by the author's own admission of a very angry response and threats of violence).

3. **Victim's Autonomy**: The friend who was abused has the right to decide who knows about her trauma and when/how it is shared. Others may have respected her wishes or acted out of concern for her safety and emotional well-being.

4. **Group Dynamics**: The group may have been trying to protect both the victim and the author, anticipating a strong reaction that could escalate the situation or cause further distress.

5. **No Malicious Intent**: There is no clear evidence of malicious intent from anyone. The author’s anger is understandable, but so is the group's caution.

6. **Conclusion**: While the author’s feelings are valid, and the group’s actions may have been hurtful, nobody is clearly ""at fault"" in a moral sense. This is a complex, emotionally charged situation where everyone was likely trying to do what they thought was best under difficult circumstances.

**Reasoning:**  
Step by step:

2. The author suggested a reasonable alternative (the brother's older child).
3. The author has a precedent of charging for babysitting, but was not planning to charge the full rate for family.
4. The brother became upset at the idea of paying, and accused the author of ""gouging"" him, referencing a previous, minor incident.
5. The author is a college student with learning disabilities and valid time constraints.

- The author is not at fault for prioritizing their studies and being upfront about their availability.

- The previous Polaroid incident is minor and was already explained.

- The mother is now upset, but this is based on the girlfriend's premature promise.
- The author is not obligated to do free labor, especially if he never agreed to it.

- She repeatedly slept in and left her child to be supervised by others without asking or confirming it was okay.
- She was rude and passive-aggressive (not offering food, refusing to communicate, blaming your son for her son's swearing despite admitting it was already a problem).
- She left the house without informing anyone, again assuming you would watch her son.
- When confronted, she deflected responsibility and dismissed your concerns.
- You (the author) acted reasonably: you cared for her son, tried to communicate, and set clear boundaries after repeated issues.

2. When Fred revealed she had a boyfriend and declined the date, John became upset and demanded his tip money back, explicitly stating that the extra tip was because of his interest.
3. John accused Fred of ""playing dumb"" and implied she was misleading him, despite her not giving any indication of romantic interest or obligation.
4. Tipping is a voluntary act for service rendered, not a transaction for romantic attention or dates.
5. Fred did nothing wrong: she was friendly and professional, and her having a boyfriend is not something she is required to disclose to customers.
6. The author’s expectation of a date in exchange for tips, and his demand for the tip back when rejected, is inappropriate and places the fault on him.

**Reasoning:**
- The author is clear about her boundaries and preferences, and communicates them to her husband. She is not preventing her husband from attending, just expressing her own discomfort and reasons for not wanting to go.

- Mark and Sarah are not at fault for inviting the couple to a significant family event; inviting friends to a baptism is normal.
- There is no evidence of anyone acting maliciously or unreasonably in this specific situation. The author’s dislike of the event and the people involved is a matter of personal preference, not a moral or social failing.

- The author called ahead and expected their food to be ready at a specific time, which is a reasonable expectation for a takeout order.
- The restaurant has its own policy for preparing food, prioritizing in-person customers and timing food to avoid sogginess, which may not align with the author's expectations but is not inherently wrong.
- The author engaged in a prolonged (10-minute) discussion with an employee who likely had no power to change the policy, and continued pressing the issue after receiving an explanation.
- A bystander commented, suggesting the conversation was excessive or disruptive.
- While the author’s initial question was reasonable, persisting for 10 minutes with a frontline employee over a policy they cannot change is generally considered inappropriate and unfair to the employee.

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Background:** The author lived with his mother and grandparents after his parents' divorce. The grandparents allowed them to stay rent-free. The mother became a full-time caregiver for the grandparents, which limited her ability to work.

2. **Author's Admission:** The author admits to not helping during a period (2011-2014), but later turned his life around, moved out, and became financially stable.

3. **Support Provided:** The author has provided significant financial and practical support to his mother: giving her money, paying for an attorney, buying her a car, and inviting her (and his brother) to live with him in a larger place.

4. **Current Situation:** The mother now works part-time, spends money on cigarettes, and does not contribute to household bills, despite the author's repeated requests for a modest contribution ($100/month, 10% of bills). She responds with avoidance and hostility.

5. **Fault Assessment:**
   - The author is not at fault for asking for a reasonable contribution, especially after providing substantial support.
   - The mother is at fault for not making any effort to contribute, despite being able to work part-time and spend on non-essentials, and for being disrespectful and uncooperative.
   - The little brother is a child and not at fault.
   - The grandparents are not involved in the current conflict.

6. **Conclusion:** The mother is primarily at fault for not contributing or making an effort to become independent, and for her negative response to reasonable requests. The author is not at fault for insisting on a small contribution.

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Author's actions:** The author asked for permission to sleep over at a friend's house. When told ""no,"" the author calmly asked for a reason, which is a reasonable and respectful request. The author became visibly and audibly irritated after being dismissed and eventually lost their cool, leading to an argument.

2. **Parents' actions:** The mother gave a flat ""no"" without explanation. The father immediately shut down further discussion, scolded the author, and refused to provide a reason, escalating the situation. The father's response was dismissive and did not acknowledge the author's desire for understanding.

3. **Resolution:** Later, the mother calmly explained the reasoning, and the author accepted it, showing that communication could have prevented the argument.

4. **Fault assessment:**  
   - The parents could have avoided escalation by providing a brief explanation initially, especially since the author is trusted with other responsibilities and is old enough to understand.
   - The author, while initially respectful, did become visibly irritated and lost their cool, contributing to the argument.
   - The father, being tired, may have been less patient, but his dismissive attitude and refusal to explain were not constructive.

5. **Conclusion:** Both sides contributed to the escalation: the parents by not communicating effectively and the author by losing their temper. Therefore, ""Everybody"" is at fault to some degree.",stop,704,294,998

BWI to MHT, Sunday night (yesterday)....",Author,Author,0.95,0.5494505494505495,False,"Confidence: 0.95

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Southwest's Policy**: Southwest Airlines has an open seating policy—no assigned seats, and saving seats is not officially allowed or supported by the airline. Passengers are expected to choose any open seat when they board, based on their boarding position.

2. **Author's Actions**: The author boarded ahead of his family and attempted to save two seats (middle and window) by placing his jacket over them. This is a common but unofficial practice, and it is not guaranteed or protected by any rule.

3. **Other Passenger's Actions**: The young woman, who boarded after the author, wanted to sit in the window seat. She was within her rights, per Southwest's policy, to claim any open seat, regardless of whether someone was ""saving"" it.

4. **Fault Assessment**: The author knowingly tried to circumvent the open seating policy by saving seats, which is not allowed. The other passenger did nothing wrong by asking to sit in an open seat.

5. **Conclusion**: The author is at fault for trying to save seats in violation of the airline's open seating policy. The other passenger was within her rights to sit where she wanted.

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author has a friend with a history of an eating disorder (ED).
   - The friend makes repeated, public, and judgmental comments about the author's eating habits, implying the author eats too little and expressing ""worry"" in a way that embarrasses the author.
   - The author feels uncomfortable, guilty, and pressured to eat more than they want to avoid comments.
   - The author is considering not eating with the friend and possibly making a pointed comment in response.

2. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The friend is making inappropriate, unsolicited, and public comments about the author's eating, which is intrusive and disrespectful.
   - The author has not made any hurtful comments or actions; they have only considered responding or changing their own behavior to avoid discomfort.
   - The friend’s history of ED may explain her behavior, but it does not excuse making others uncomfortable or shaming them for their eating habits.

3. **Is the author at fault?**  
   - No. The author is not at fault for feeling uncomfortable, wanting to avoid meals with the friend, or even for considering a defensive response. They have not acted in a way that is hurtful or inappropriate.

4. **Is everyone at fault?**  
   - No. Only the friend is making problematic comments.

5. **Is nobody at fault?**  
   - No. The friend’s behavior is clearly at fault.

6. **Is more info needed?**  
   - No. The situation is described in detail.

**Conclusion:**  
The friend (other) is at fault for making repeated, judgmental, and embarrassing comments about the author's eating habits. The author is not at fault for their feelings or for wanting to avoid meals with the friend.",stop,834,385,1219

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Bus Situation (Coughing Child):**
   - The child coughed in the author's face, which was accidental at first, but then continued to cough without covering her mouth.
   - The parents did not correct the child or encourage her to cover her mouth.
   - The author was understandably upset but did not retaliate or escalate the situation, only giving a reflexive dirty look.

   **Fault:** The parents are at fault for not teaching or reminding their child about basic hygiene and consideration for others in a public, crowded space.

2. **General Park Annoyances:**
   - The author is frustrated by people stopping in walkways, inconsiderate scooter use, and parents with newborns in the sun.
   - These are common annoyances in crowded public places, and while the author is irritated, there is no evidence of the author acting out or being rude to others.

   **Fault:** These are minor social annoyances caused by other people’s inconsiderate behavior, not the author’s.

3. **Plane Situation (Bathroom Request):**
   - The author is asked to get up for a child to use the bathroom while the seatbelt sign is on.
   - The author points out the seatbelt sign, but the parent responds rudely and pressures the author to get up.
   - The author complies to avoid confrontation.
   - The flight attendants do not enforce the seatbelt rule.

   **Fault:** The parent is at fault for being rude and disregarding safety rules. The flight attendants could also be considered at fault for not enforcing the rules, but the main issue is the parent’s attitude.

4. **Author’s Self-Reflection:**
   - The author wonders if they are the problem for being bothered by these things.
   - The author does not act out or cause harm to others; their frustration is internal or expressed mildly (a muttered comment, a dirty look).

   **Conclusion:** The author is not at fault for being annoyed by inconsiderate behavior. The actual problematic actions are by others (the parents on the bus and plane, and generally inconsiderate people in public spaces). The author’s reactions are normal and restrained.

**Summary:** The author is not at fault; the inconsiderate actions of others are the root cause of the frustration. The author’s self-questioning is a sign of self-awareness, not guilt.

Step by step reasoning:
- The author received poor service and considered leaving negative feedback through the official survey.
- The husband is concerned that negative feedback could unfairly impact workers who may be struggling or short-staffed.
- The author is not at fault for considering or leaving honest feedback about their experience; this is a normal and accepted part of customer service.
- The workers are not necessarily at fault without more information about why the mistakes happened (e.g., understaffing, equipment failure, etc.).
- The situation describes a service failure but does not provide evidence of malice, negligence, or intentional harm by any party.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**
- The author admits to unhealthy behavior, including drug abuse and entering their friend's home without permission while intoxicated. This is a significant violation of trust and personal boundaries.
- The friend chose to end the friendship, which is a reasonable response to such a breach.
- The author continues to push for clarification and contact, despite the friend's clear boundaries and request to keep interactions professional.
- While the author expresses remorse and guilt, the responsibility for the situation and the breakdown of the friendship lies with their actions.
- The friend's reaction, including setting boundaries and limiting contact, is justified given the circumstances.

Final Answer: Author

Step by step reasoning:
- The author used their phone during a live, small, acoustic concert, which is generally considered an intimate and attentive setting.
- Using a phone in this context is widely seen as disrespectful to both the performer and other audience members, as it can be distracting and signals disengagement.
- The partner and friends found it rude, which aligns with common social expectations for such events.
- The author compares it to reading a book in a bar, but a bar is a much less focused environment than a small concert.
- The author immediately put the phone away when asked, which is good, but the initial behavior was still inconsiderate.
- There is no indication that others were at fault or that more information is needed.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is expressing legitimate concerns about safety, boundaries, and the unknown risks of inviting a stranger (with a potentially dangerous ex) into their home.
- The wife is showing empathy and wants to help, which is also reasonable and compassionate.
- The author does not prevent the wife from helping in other ways (e.g., suggesting a shelter or returning to family/friends).
- There is no evidence of malice, irresponsibility, or neglect from either party—just a difference in risk tolerance and approach to helping.
- The situation is a difficult one with no clear ""fault""—just a disagreement on how to handle it.

- The author describes feeling insecure about their girlfriend talking to another man and not telling them about it.
- The author ""flipped out"" on their girlfriend and later ""yelled"" at her, repeatedly questioning her about the other guy.
- The girlfriend's actions (talking to a male friend/classmate, not immediately telling the author about him) are not inherently wrong or deceptive, especially in a college setting where social interactions are normal.
- The author’s reaction—yelling, demanding to know about every person she talks to, and making the situation about their own insecurities—crosses a line into controlling and inappropriate behavior.
- The author is responsible for managing their own insecurities in a healthy way, not by lashing out at their partner.

**Reasoning:**  
Based on your description, you were making an effort not to block the walkway and there was a significant gap (3 feet) between your foot and the door. You also have a legitimate reason for propping your foot up (pain/ache), and you have a hearing impairment that made it difficult to hear the other person.

- The girlfriend is at fault for physically assaulting the author (punching him in the face during sex, causing injury). Physical violence is never acceptable.
- The girlfriend's family is at fault for being hostile and threatening violence toward the author.
- The relationship was clearly dysfunctional, with both parties contributing to its breakdown through poor communication, unresolved anger, and harmful actions.

- The author is asking if they are at fault (""AITA"") for not taking action (blocking/cutting off Mark) after seeing accusations made by Alex, with whom they are not close, about Mark, a former friend with whom they've drifted apart.
- The author does not have direct knowledge of the situation, only social media posts and allusions.
- The author is not actively supporting or enabling any abuse, nor are they close enough to either party to intervene meaningfully.
- The author expresses willingness to learn more if the situation changes (e.g., if Mark reaches out).
- There is no evidence that the author is causing harm by not acting, given their distance from both parties and lack of involvement.

While it's understandable to be curious about a former partner's identity, your ex-girlfriend's sexuality is her personal information to share or not share as she chooses. Pressing her for details after the breakup, especially when she indicated it wasn't your business and was hostile in response, crosses a boundary.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Sam is not your in-house counsel; he was brought in as an outside expert for a specific deal.
- You were aware it was his wedding day and told him there was a 1% chance you’d need him, but still kept him on-call.
- When the emergency happened, you called him during his wedding and, when he initially refused, threatened his job if he didn’t comply.
- While you did warn him, the expectation to be on-call during a major life event (wedding) is unreasonable, especially for a non-employee/contractor, unless there was a prior, explicit agreement (with appropriate compensation or arrangement).
- Threatening his job for not immediately responding during his wedding is excessive and unprofessional.
- The fact that you apologized later suggests you recognize the overstep.

- You admit you responded less kindly than you could have, but this was in the heat of the moment and not overtly cruel.
- Your sister left the game out of frustration, which is a normal emotional response.

- The primary responsibility for fidelity lies with the married person, but knowingly participating in an affair also carries moral responsibility.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author is a 26-year-old woman with a 7-year-old brother.
   - She does not like children and does not want to be responsible for her brother.
   - Her parents, especially her mother, are overwhelmed and sometimes ask her to help.
   - The brother has special needs and sometimes acts out physically.
   - The author admits to locking her brother in his room when he attacks her, as an alternative to acting on her anger.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The author is clear about her boundaries and her lack of desire or ability to care for children, which is not inherently wrong.
   - However, the author admits to locking a special needs child in his room as a response to his behavior, and expresses violent impulses (""beating the absolute brakes off him"").
   - Locking a child in a room as a form of discipline, especially when the child has special needs and is acting out, is not an appropriate or safe response. It can be considered neglectful or even abusive, depending on the circumstances.
   - The author recognizes her own lack of fitness to care for children, but still accepts the responsibility at times, leading to potentially harmful situations for the child.

3. **Other Parties:**  
   - The parents may be at fault for asking someone unfit to babysit, but the author is the one who actually locks the child in the room and expresses violent inclinations.
   - The brother is a child with special needs and cannot be held responsible for his actions in this context.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for accepting responsibility for her brother when she knows she is not equipped to handle him safely, and for using inappropriate disciplinary measures.
   - While the parents may share some responsibility for putting her in this position, the direct actions described (locking the child in a room, violent thoughts) are the author's.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author's Actions:**  
   - The author struggled with depression for years, sought help when prompted by a job interview, and followed professional advice by starting therapy and medication.
   - The author did not initially tell their parents about the medication, but this was not out of malice or intent to deceive; they had moved out and were handling their own healthcare.
   - When asked, the author was honest and explained the situation to their mother.

2. **Parents' Actions:**  
   - The parents were initially unaware of the author's depression, which is understandable since the author hadn't shared it.
   - The father's reaction to the medication was negative, leading to less communication and a sense of unwelcome, which is hurtful but may stem from misunderstanding, stigma, or difficulty processing the situation.

3. **Fault Assessment:**  
   - The author did nothing wrong; they acted responsibly regarding their mental health and were honest when asked.
   - The father's reaction is unfortunate, but it is likely rooted in his own struggles to understand or accept the situation, not a clear-cut ""fault"" in a moral sense.
   - There is no evidence of malice, neglect, or wrongdoing from any party—just a difficult family situation with emotional responses.

**Conclusion:**  
No one is truly ""at fault"" here. The author is not an asshole, nor did they do anything wrong. The situation is a result of complex emotions and communication challenges, not blameworthy actions.

**Reasoning:**
- The author admits to ""getting mean"" and snapping at Tiffany, telling her that her art was lackluster and essentially confirming her exclusion from AP Art was justified.
- While Tiffany was persistent and perhaps annoying, she did not insult the author directly; her complaints were about the teacher and her own frustration.
- The author could have set boundaries or disengaged from the conversation without resorting to hurtful comments about Tiffany's abilities.
- The teacher handled the situation diplomatically, but the author chose a more confrontational and hurtful approach.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step by step reasoning:
- The situation describes a couple facing a major life decision: whether to start a family now as previously planned, or for the wife to pursue law school with tuition reimbursement, which would delay having children.
- The author expresses concerns about fertility, social aspects for their future child, and financial risks, while the wife wants to take advantage of a significant career opportunity.
- The author is ""absolutely opposed"" to postponing their family plans, but is not described as taking any action to prevent his wife from pursuing her goals, nor is there evidence of disrespect or coercion.
- The wife is not described as dismissing the author's concerns, only as wanting to pursue law school.
- Both parties have valid concerns and desires, and this is a classic example of a difficult but common life crossroads where priorities may shift.
- There is no clear wrongdoing, malice, or irresponsibility on either side—just a conflict of interests and values that requires communication and compromise.

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author (the child) expressed honest feelings about missing their mom's ex-boyfriend, who, despite being allegedly abusive to the mom, was kind and supportive to the author.
- The mom responded by lashing out, punishing the author, and saying hurtful things (e.g., ""you are just as bad for missing him""), which is an inappropriate and unfair reaction to a child's honest emotions.
- The author did not know the full extent of the abuse and was simply expressing their own experience and feelings.
- The mom, while possibly traumatized, is responsible for her reaction and for punishing her child for feelings they cannot control.
- The ex-boyfriend may be at fault for his alleged abuse, but the question is about the specific situation of the author expressing their feelings and the mom's reaction.
- Therefore, in this specific situation, the mom (other) is at fault for her reaction to the author's honest confession.",stop,871,207,1078

- The men’s bathroom was out of order, and men were instructed to use the upstairs bathroom.
- A man used the women’s restroom downstairs, which made the author uncomfortable.
- The author reported the incident to HR, following her boss’s advice.
- The man may have been at fault for not following the sign, but he may have had a reason (e.g., emergency, confusion).
- The author is not at fault for feeling uncomfortable or for reporting the incident, as this is a reasonable response in a workplace setting.
- The man may not be at fault if he was unaware of the rules or if there was an urgent need.
- The company is not at fault if they provided clear instructions and signage.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**
- The author transparently mentioned to David (wife's friend) that he would like a small cut if a deal is made, and David agreed (""of course, that's obvious"").
- The author is not demanding money from his own friend George, but from David, who is seeking investors and may expect to pay a finder's fee.
- In many business contexts, it is normal to receive a referral fee for connecting parties in a deal, as long as all parties are aware and agree.
- The wife disagrees, but this is a difference in values or social expectations, not a matter of fault or wrongdoing.
- No one was deceived, pressured, or harmed; all parties acted with transparency.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
You (the author) are aware that the customer did not intend to give you an $8 tip, and you recognize that taking both the $4 cash and the $4 on the card is taking advantage of their mistake. Even though you feel justified due to your job circumstances and tipping norms, knowingly taking more than the customer intended is dishonest. The customer made a clear effort to correct the tip to match the cash they had, so taking both is not an honest mistake—it's a deliberate choice.

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is making a request that, while understandable from a comfort perspective, could be seen as unreasonable or hurtful to their partner, especially if it makes him feel unwelcome or embarrassed in his own home.
- The husband’s reaction—refusing to even consider the request and calling it immature—shows a lack of willingness to compromise or empathize with the author’s discomfort.
- Both parties are letting the issue escalate into “petty fights” rather than having a calm, empathetic discussion or seeking a compromise (e.g., better ventilation, air fresheners, or a schedule).
- The author admits part of the motivation is “selfish,” and the husband’s response is described as “angry” and “immature,” suggesting both are contributing to the conflict.

Therefore, both share responsibility for the escalation and lack of compromise.",stop,504,187,691

Final Answer: Nobody

Step by step reasoning:
- The situation describes a disagreement between friends over a controversial topic (vaccines and autism).
- The author is considering ending the friendship because of the friend's beliefs.
- The friend expressed her views, which the author finds uncomfortable and strongly disagrees with.
- There is no indication of malicious intent, harm, or wrongdoing beyond holding and expressing controversial beliefs.
- People are allowed to end friendships for personal reasons, including differences in core values or beliefs.
- The friend is not at fault for having her beliefs (even if they are factually incorrect), and the author is not at fault for considering ending the friendship over a fundamental disagreement.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step by step reasoning:
- The author is describing his dating preferences and experiences, specifically that he, a 51-year-old man, tends to date women in their 20s or 30s.
- He states he does not pursue younger women specifically for their youth, but is more attracted to them.
- He acknowledges that these relationships often have issues (infidelity, incompatibility, gold-digging), but frames his actions as seeking mutual attraction.
- There is no indication of illegal or non-consensual behavior, nor is there evidence of manipulation or coercion by the author.
- While some may find large age gaps in relationships distasteful or problematic, the situation as described does not assign clear fault to any party.
- The issues described (infidelity, incompatibility, etc.) are common in many relationships and not necessarily the result of the age gap alone.
- Therefore, based on the information provided, nobody is clearly at fault.",stop,307,204,511

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author (the pregnant woman) has a personal belief about not sharing the baby’s name before birth, which is a common superstition and a personal boundary. She is not singling out her sister; she hasn’t told anyone.
- The sister feels hurt because she has provided significant support and feels excluded or untrusted, but her expectation to be told the name is based on her own feelings, not an obligation.
- The author acknowledges her gratitude but also sets boundaries, which is reasonable.
- The sister’s emotional reaction is understandable, but she is not owed the name, and the author is not obligated to share it.
- There is no clear wrongdoing or malice from either party; it’s a clash of expectations and feelings, not a fault.

- Your boyfriend, however, responded with anger, yelling, and repeated demands for apologies, but did not communicate clearly about what he wanted or help resolve the issue. He escalated the situation, accused you of manipulation, and continued to call and berate you.
- While it would have been ideal to ask before reorganizing, your actions were reasonable and well-intentioned, and you took responsibility when you realized there was a problem.

Step by step reasoning:
- The author is not at fault for wanting to spend their anniversary with their girlfriend; this is a reasonable and important milestone for many people.
- The parents are not necessarily at fault for wanting to plan a family vacation and include their child, even inviting another family to make it more enjoyable.
- The conflict arises from a clash of priorities and timing, not from malice or neglect.
- The parents' attempt to guilt trip the author is not ideal, but it is a common family dynamic and not egregiously harmful in this context.
- There is no clear wrongdoing or malicious intent from either side; it is a situation of conflicting desires and expectations.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
- The ""douchebag"" was rude and mocking in high school, and at the party he made a mocking comment again. This is disrespectful, but not physically aggressive.
- The author confronted him verbally, which is a reasonable response to being mocked.
- The other person backed down and said he was ""only messing,"" indicating he was not escalating or seeking a fight.
- The author then spat in his face, which is a physical act of aggression and humiliation.
- Spitting on someone is widely considered a serious escalation and a form of assault, regardless of provocation.
- The author justifies it by saying he had ""so little respect for him as a human being,"" which does not excuse the action.
- While the other person was rude, the author’s response was disproportionate and crossed a line.

- There is a conflict of preferences, but no one is acting maliciously or unreasonably.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
- The author politely expressed discomfort about the girlfriend's behavior (filming the cat in the litter box, lightly inserting a finger in the cat's mouth).
- The author communicated their feelings and boundaries without being rude or aggressive.
- The girlfriend dismissed the author's concerns and continued to justify her actions, even sending a video despite the author's discomfort.
- The author only insisted that the girlfriend stop after seeing the cat was visibly distressed in the video.
- The author is not at fault for advocating for the cat's privacy and well-being, nor for setting boundaries about what content they want to receive.
- The girlfriend is at fault for disregarding the cat's comfort and the author's boundaries.

The author is upset that their mother does not want wine brought to the gathering out of respect for the uncle's recovery.

Step by step reasoning:
- The mother is prioritizing the uncle's well-being, which is a reasonable and considerate action, given that exposure to alcohol can be triggering for someone in recovery.
- The author feels it's unfair to restrict wine for all guests because of one person's issue, which is a common sentiment but may lack empathy for the uncle's situation.
- The author is not necessarily at fault for feeling disappointed, but taking issue with the mother's boundary (especially in her home) shows a lack of understanding of the seriousness of addiction and recovery.
- The mother, as the host, has the right to set rules in her home, especially to protect a vulnerable family member.
- The uncle is not at fault for his recovery needs.
- The other guests are not at fault.

- The author is expressing concern for a friend based on their own values, limited experience with drugs, and anxiety. Their reaction is rooted in care, not malice.
- The friend is making her own choices as an adult, and while the author is worried about her mental health and drug use, there is no evidence of coercion or recklessness toward others.
- The confrontation was not aggressive or harmful; it was a conversation about feelings and boundaries.
- Both parties are acting from their own perspectives and experiences, and neither is intentionally causing harm.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author's Actions:** The author bought a high-quality face wash for her boyfriend, which she knows is good because she used it during a previous relationship. She was honest about how she knew it was good. She is not in contact with her ex and has no feelings for him.

2. **Boyfriend's Reaction:** The boyfriend feels uncomfortable receiving a gift that is associated with the author's ex, especially since it reminds him of a difficult period in their relationship. He expresses his feelings and prefers not to use the product.

3. **Intentions and Communication:** The author did not intend to upset her boyfriend or make him feel like he was receiving a ""regift"" from a previous relationship. She was transparent and tried to do something nice.

4. **Boundaries and Sensitivity:** The boyfriend is entitled to his feelings and boundaries, even if the author finds them a bit unreasonable. The author is also entitled to her perspective that a good product is a good product, regardless of its origin.

5. **Fault Assessment:** There is no clear wrongdoing here. The author acted in good faith, and the boyfriend communicated his discomfort. This is a matter of personal boundaries and preferences, not malice or insensitivity.

This is a situation where two people have different emotional responses to a neutral object due to past associations. Neither party is at fault; it's a matter of communication and understanding each other's feelings.",stop,526,307,833

- It's understandable to be frustrated, but expressing it in a way that is dismissive of something a friend is passionate about, especially after she toned it down and tried to respect boundaries, is insensitive.
- The friend’s response (""You literally just broke my heart"") shows that the comment was hurtful.
- While the friend may have been a bit much with her obsession, the author’s delivery crossed into being mean rather than just setting a boundary.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author’s Actions:** The author was honest about her feelings regarding sexual chemistry and communicated her desire to work on it together. She was upfront, respectful, and gave the other person a choice.

2. **Other Person’s Actions:** The guy chose to ghost after being told about the lack of chemistry and the suggestion to work on it. While ghosting can be seen as immature or hurtful, it is also a common way people handle uncomfortable situations, especially if they feel embarrassed or rejected.

3. **Fault Assessment:**  
   - The author is not at fault for being honest and wanting to improve the relationship.
   - The other person is not strictly at fault for not wanting to continue or for not responding, as he may have felt uncomfortable or hurt.
   - There is no evidence of malice, manipulation, or wrongdoing from either party.

4. **Conclusion:** This is a situation where two people were not compatible, and both handled it in ways that are understandable, if not ideal. No one is truly ""at fault"" here; it’s just an unfortunate mismatch and a case of honest communication not being reciprocated.

**Summary:**  
No one is at fault. The author was honest and respectful, and the other person chose not to engage further, which is his prerogative. This is a normal part of dating and relationships.

- Weddings are personal events, and the couple has the right to decide who attends.

This situation is complex and emotionally charged, but based on the information provided, there is no clear ""fault"" in the present moment. The author is not at fault for feeling ambivalent or for not wanting to reach out to a biological parent who was absent and emotionally abusive. The biological father made choices in the past that hurt the author, but the current question is about whether the author should feel obligated to reach out after his stroke. The mother and stepfather are not at fault; they are simply relaying information and offering advice. The husband is encouraging compassion, which is a reasonable and kind suggestion, but not a demand.

No one is currently ""at fault"" for the situation as it stands—it's about how the author feels and what, if anything, they want to do next.

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Dorm Rules:** The dorm has clear rules: quiet after 11pm and people of the opposite sex must be in their rooms. The roommate is breaking both rules by having people over late and being noisy.

2. **Your Actions:** You tried to resolve the issue by messaging her and, when that didn’t work, contacting the dorm supervisor. These are reasonable steps to take when someone is breaking rules and disturbing your peace.

3. **Roommate’s Response:** She was temporarily respectful after being spoken to, but then resumed her previous behavior. Her response to your messages was to become angry and suggest you move out, rather than addressing her own rule-breaking.

4. **Your Feelings:** Your discomfort is valid, especially given your social anxiety and the fact that the rules are on your side.

5. **Potential Escalation:** If you contact the dorm supervisor again, you are still within your rights, as she is the one breaking the rules.

**Conclusion:**  
Your roommate is at fault for repeatedly breaking dorm rules and being inconsiderate of your need for quiet and your right to a peaceful living environment. You are not being unreasonable or controlling by asking her to follow the rules. If you escalate the issue, you would not be the asshole; you would be enforcing the agreed-upon standards of the dorm.

- Your boyfriend’s reaction was extremely negative and accusatory, calling you “creepy” and likening your visit to stalking, despite this being your first time and with no prior warning or discussion.
- In healthy relationships, if someone feels uncomfortable with a partner visiting their workplace, it’s reasonable to communicate that boundary clearly and kindly, not with shock and accusations.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Background:** The author describes having strong aversions to perceived uncleanliness and admits to sometimes struggling to control their reactions. They also mention being aware that their behavior can be annoying to others.

2. **The Situation:** A person (the cousin) who is generally avoided by others wants to join a game. The author, after some provocation (being called ""anal""), loudly and publicly insults the person, specifically targeting their hygiene and smell.

3. **The Cousin's Behavior:** The cousin is described as socially awkward, self-centered, and inconsiderate (talking over others, invading personal space, farting deliberately). These behaviors are rude and can be understandably frustrating.

4. **The Author's Response:** The author responds to the cousin's request to play by loudly and publicly shaming him for his hygiene and smell, which is a personal and hurtful attack.

5. **Social Dynamics:** The rest of the group is uncomfortable but does not intervene. The cousin's own cousin tries to signal the author to drop it, indicating that the group recognizes the situation is delicate.

6. **Aftermath:** The cousin is hurt and leaves, his cousin blocks the author, and the guidance counselor wants to speak to the author, suggesting the incident was seen as serious.

7. **Fault Assessment:**
   - The cousin's behavior is rude and inconsiderate, but not malicious in the same way as a public personal attack.
   - The author escalates the situation by publicly shaming the cousin in a way that is likely to be deeply hurtful and humiliating.
   - The group’s inaction is passive, but not directly at fault for the escalation.

8. **Conclusion:** While the cousin's behavior is problematic, the author’s public and personal attack crosses a line into bullying. The author could have set boundaries or excused themselves without resorting to humiliation. The guidance counselor’s involvement and the cousin’s cousin blocking the author further indicate that the author’s actions were seen as unacceptable.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is expressing their feelings and needs in a relationship, specifically wanting to spend time with their partner doing mutually enjoyable activities.
- The author acknowledges their own challenges (mental health, neurodivergence, emotional needs) and is self-aware about being ""clingy,"" but also notes that their girlfriend has said she likes this aspect.
- The girlfriend is described as busy and often only wanting to do activities she prefers, but there is no indication of malice or intentional neglect—just a mismatch of needs and priorities.
- The author is not demanding or forcing their girlfriend to do things, but is expressing a desire for more balance.
- Wanting to do things together that both people enjoy is a reasonable and healthy expectation in a relationship.
- There is no clear wrongdoing, abuse, or neglect from either party—just a communication and compatibility issue.

Therefore, in this situation, nobody is truly ""at fault."" It's a matter of differing needs and communication, not blame.",stop,640,213,853

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - You asked to check the time on your boyfriend's phone.
   - He acted suspiciously, yanking the phone away and reading the time to you.
   - You asked if he was hiding something; he denied it.
   - You asked to see his phone, referencing your mutual access to each other's phones.
   - He reluctantly agreed and stood with you as you checked his messages.
   - You discovered he was hiding something you had previously set a boundary about (helping underage friends get alcohol).
   - He apologized, but when you didn't immediately accept, he got angry and accused you of invading his privacy.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - **Your actions:** You asked for permission, and he gave it (albeit reluctantly). You did not go through his phone without his knowledge or consent.
   - **His actions:** He was hiding something that violated a boundary you had clearly communicated. He lied about it, tried to hide it, and only got angry about ""privacy"" after being caught, despite having given permission.

3. **Privacy Consideration:**  
   - While privacy in relationships is important, in this case, you had a precedent of mutual phone access, and you asked for permission.
   - His anger about privacy seems more like a deflection after being caught breaking your trust.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The main issue is his violation of your boundary and his dishonesty, not your actions.
   - You acted within the norms of your relationship and with his (reluctant) consent.

**Therefore, the person at fault is the boyfriend (Other), not you (the author).**",stop,579,360,939

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Recap:**  
   - Your partner was assaulted by someone in her community years ago.
   - She still sometimes encounters this person at community events.
   - You expressed discomfort at the idea of being at an event where her assaulter might be present, and said you’d rather she not go either.
   - You also said that if you were drunk and something escalated, you wouldn’t be able to control yourself.
   - She said that would be mortifying for the community.
   - You said you were disinvited and didn’t discuss it further.
   - Now, she’s going out with her friends for Christmas Eve, and you’re alone, wondering if you’re at fault.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - It’s understandable to feel protective and uncomfortable about your partner being around her assaulter.
   - However, telling your partner you’d rather she not go, and especially saying you wouldn’t be able to control yourself if something escalated, puts pressure on her and makes her responsible for your feelings and potential actions.
   - The decision about how to handle her own trauma and her relationship to her community is hers to make.
   - You effectively withdrew from the situation (“I was disinvited”) rather than having a mature conversation about boundaries, support, and feelings.
   - She is not at fault for wanting to see her friends and maintain her social life, even in a difficult context.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - While your feelings are valid, your actions—especially the implied threat of losing control and the pressure on her not to go—are not fair to your partner.
   - The primary fault here lies with you (the author) for how you handled the situation.

**Summary:**  
You are at fault for how you handled your discomfort and for putting pressure on your partner regarding her choices.",stop,440,398,838

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The boyfriend is at fault for not giving the relationship and serious conversations the attention they deserve, prioritizing the game over meaningful communication, and not respecting the request to put the game down during important discussions.
- The author acknowledges not having clearly communicated their feelings about the boyfriend's behavior, which is also a contributing factor to the ongoing frustration and lack of resolution.
- Both parties have contributed to the problem: the boyfriend through his actions, and the author through lack of direct communication.
- Therefore, responsibility is shared.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The girlfriend's father died after a long illness. She was his primary carer and is now arranging his funeral according to his wishes (woodland burial, no religious elements).
2. The author, her boyfriend, refuses to attend the funeral because it makes him uncomfortable due to his religious background, even though he acknowledges it's her father's wish and her choice.
3. The girlfriend is upset, feeling unsupported at a critical and vulnerable time, and says the author is putting his religion before her feelings and their relationship.
4. The author offers logistical support (drop off, pick up) but not emotional support by being present at the funeral.

Analysis:
- The funeral is not about the author's comfort or religious preferences; it is about supporting his grieving partner and respecting her father's wishes.
- The author is not being asked to participate in religious rites contrary to his beliefs, but simply to be present for his partner.
- Refusing to attend, especially when the girlfriend assumed he would be there, is likely to be perceived as unsupportive and selfish, particularly given the emotional context.

Therefore, the author is at fault for prioritizing his discomfort over his partner's need for support during a major life event.",stop,471,259,730

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author confessed romantic feelings to a friend who clearly stated she wanted to remain friends.
- The author agreed to remain friends, but continued to express strong feelings and compliments, which he noticed made her uncomfortable.
- He stopped complimenting her, which was appropriate.
- However, while drunk, he told her he loved her and kissed her on the cheek, despite knowing her boundaries and her previous rejection.
- Alcohol is not an excuse for disregarding someone's boundaries.
- The friend did nothing wrong; she was clear and respectful.
- The author is at fault for overstepping the boundaries of friendship after being told explicitly that a romantic relationship was not wanted.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
You are not at fault for wanting to set boundaries in your own home, especially when past behavior from guests has been disruptive, disrespectful, or potentially unsafe for your family. It is reasonable to ask guests not to drink if their drinking has previously led to problems, especially with children and a pregnant spouse in the house. You are not forbidding them from drinking in their own lives, just in your home during their visit. The guests are responsible for their own behavior, but you are within your rights to set house rules. Therefore, nobody is at fault for you expressing this boundary.",stop,607,134,741

1. **Your girlfriend expressed an insecurity** about whether anyone else would love her because of how you treat her.
2. **You were surprised** by this, partly because you interpreted it as her thinking about being with other people.
3. **You responded by accusing her of faking her insecurities**, citing her social media posts where she boasts about other guys being interested in her.
4. **You confronted her about the posts**, and she said she curves those guys and it's just a joke with her friends.
5. **You are asking if you are at fault (AITA) for calling her out.**

**Analysis:**
- Relationships require open communication and empathy, especially around insecurities.
- Your girlfriend's behavior (posting about other guys, boasting, etc.) could be seen as insensitive or attention-seeking, which might understandably bother you.
- However, when she expressed an insecurity, you dismissed it as ""faking,"" which is invalidating and not a constructive way to address her feelings.
- Both of you seem to be contributing to the conflict: she by posting things that could hurt you and you by dismissing her feelings rather than discussing them.

**Fault Assessment:**
- Your girlfriend is at fault for posting things that could be seen as disrespectful to your relationship.
- You are at fault for invalidating her feelings and not addressing the issue with empathy.

- The person is considering the impact this would have on their own life, especially their new relationship.
- The person is unsure how to respond and is seeking advice.
- There is no indication of wrongdoing, malice, or negligence by anyone involved.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**
- The author entered a stream and posted a message (ResidentSleeper) that is commonly used to indicate boredom or that something is dull. This is a negative comment, even if intended as a joke.
- After being timed out, the author doubled down with another sarcastic comment about falling asleep, which escalated the situation and resulted in a permanent ban.
- The next day, the author sought out the same streamer in another chat and again made a negative comment about her being boring.
- The streamer and chat reacted negatively, and the author was told off and called a troll.

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1. The author initiated the negative interaction by posting a message that could be interpreted as rude or dismissive.
2. After being warned (timed out), the author continued with similar behavior instead of moving on or apologizing.
3. The author then sought out the same person in a different context and repeated the negative behavior.
4. The streamers and chat moderators responded by banning and calling out the author, which is within their right to moderate their community as they see fit.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author asked their girlfriend to take a second pregnancy test, not because of any specific evidence of dishonesty, but because of a general desire to ""be sure"" and a stated willingness to get a DNA test in the future ""just in case.""
- The girlfriend interpreted this as a lack of trust, which is a reasonable reaction, since asking for proof of pregnancy (and later, paternity) without cause implies suspicion.
- The author claims this is not about trust, but their actions communicate otherwise. In relationships, trust is foundational, and asking for proof in the absence of any reason to doubt can be hurtful and damaging.
- The author is not wrong to want certainty in life-changing situations, but the way they handled it—immediately asking for another test and stating they would get a DNA test—shows a lack of trust and sensitivity.
- The girlfriend's reaction is understandable, and she is not at fault for being upset.

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Background:** The author is Jewish, dating someone from a racist, traditional Southern family. The partner's father is openly racist and belittling, both to the author and to minorities in general. The partner asks the author to ""put up with it"" for the sake of family.

2. **Situation:** The partner's family is struggling financially. A $20 gift limit is set for Christmas to avoid embarrassment. The author's family disregards this and gives expensive gifts, including a $900 scope to the partner's father.

3. **Outcome:** The partner's father is furious at being ""upstaged"" and leaves. The partner is upset with the author, and the relationship ends within a year.

4. **Fault Analysis:**
   - The partner's father is openly racist, belittling, and hostile. He creates a toxic environment and is the source of most of the conflict.
   - The partner enables this behavior by asking the author to tolerate it.
   - The author's family disregards the agreed-upon $20 limit, which could be seen as inconsiderate, but their intent was to be generous and supportive, especially given the mistreatment the author endured.
   - The partner's father's anger is rooted in pride and bigotry, not in a reasonable response to a social faux pas.

5. **Conclusion:** The primary fault lies with the partner's father (and, to a lesser extent, the partner for enabling him). The author's family may have been a bit tone-deaf to the gift limit, but their actions were not malicious and were a response to ongoing mistreatment.

**Therefore, the author and their family are not the ""assholes"" in this situation. The fault lies with the partner's father and, by extension, the partner.**

- The author gave her a fair chance (trial with grandparents), rather than outright refusing her request.
- The author’s decision not to hire her is based on her current ability and the needs of the business, not on personal animosity or unfairness.

- The author intentionally encouraged their roommate to start Juuling, not just casually but with the explicit goal of making it more convenient for themselves to obtain pods.
- The author offered their Juul to the roommate, encouraged her to buy her own, and accompanied her to purchase one.
- While the roommate had some prior experience with nicotine, she was not a regular user and did not Juul before meeting the author.
- The roommate is ultimately responsible for her own choices, but the author’s actions were a clear and significant influence in her developing a regular habit and subsequent addiction.
- The author’s motivation was self-serving, not just social or incidental.
- While peer pressure from others existed, the author’s direct and purposeful encouragement makes them primarily at fault in this specific situation.

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Agreement**: You (the author) clearly communicated your limitations up front: you could not keep the foster dog through the holidays. This is responsible and transparent.

2. **Effort and Responsibility**: You provided food, training, transportation, and even paid for obedience classes. You made significant efforts to help the dog and fulfill your role as a foster parent.

3. **Rescue’s Role**: The rescue failed to adequately advertise your foster dog, focusing instead on puppies and cats. Since social media is the main adoption channel, this likely contributed to the dog not being adopted.

4. **Communication and Support**: When you asked for help due to behavioral issues and your upcoming travel, the rescue repeatedly told you no other foster homes were available, even after other animals were adopted out and foster homes should have opened up.

5. **Resolution**: Only after you made a (bluff) threat did the rescue find an adopter, suggesting they could have acted sooner.

6. **Aftermath**: The rescue cut ties with you, but you had already decided not to continue due to their lack of support.

**Conclusion**:  
You acted responsibly and communicated your needs and limitations. The rescue failed to support you, did not advertise the dog properly, and did not act to resolve the situation until pressured. The main fault lies with the rescue organization for not fulfilling their responsibilities to both you and the dog.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author is close to their dad, who is dating someone the author’s age.
   - The author has previously made efforts to get to know their dad’s partners.
   - The author refuses to meet the current girlfriend and does not want to invite her to their wedding.
   - The wedding is small, and only people the couple sees/talks to frequently are invited.
   - The dad’s girlfriend hasn’t told her family about him, which the author interprets as a sign the relationship isn’t serious.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - **Wedding Invitations:** The author has the right to invite whomever they want to their wedding, especially if it’s small and intimate.  
   - **Refusing to Meet:** The author is refusing to even meet the girlfriend, which is a change from their previous openness. This could be seen as unfair to the dad, especially since the author has met previous partners.
   - **Double Standard:** The author is using the girlfriend’s lack of disclosure to her family as a reason not to meet her, but this is based on secondhand information and assumptions about the seriousness of the relationship.
   - **Impact on Dad:** The dad may feel hurt or excluded, especially if he wants his partner to be part of important family events.

3. **Social Norms:**  
   - It’s generally expected to at least meet a parent’s long-term partner, especially if the parent wants you to.
   - Excluding a significant other from a major life event (like a wedding) can be seen as a slight, unless there are strong reasons (e.g., history of conflict, very new relationship).

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is within their rights to control their wedding guest list, but their refusal to even meet the girlfriend and their reasoning (age difference, assumptions about seriousness) suggest a lack of openness and empathy toward their dad’s relationship.
   - The author’s actions are more about personal discomfort than any wrongdoing by the dad or girlfriend.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**
- The author is treating the youngest child differently from her siblings based on her weight, restricting her diet while allowing the others to eat more freely.
- This differential treatment is causing the youngest child emotional distress and could contribute to negative feelings about food, self-esteem, and body image.
- While the author’s intentions may be rooted in concern for the child’s health, the approach risks causing psychological harm and possibly disordered eating patterns.
- The author acknowledges feeling bad about the situation and that the child gets upset, but continues the practice.
- The grandmother’s concerns are valid: research shows that restrictive feeding practices and singling out a child for their weight can have long-term negative effects.
- A more supportive, family-wide approach to healthy eating and activity would be healthier for all children and avoid singling out one child.

Final Answer: Author

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Initial Communication:** The author communicated their desire to go to a peep show and asked their girlfriend to join. The girlfriend declined but explicitly said it was okay for the author to go alone.

2. **At the Peep Show:** The author asked again if the girlfriend wanted to join, and she declined again. The author then went in alone, as previously agreed.

3. **Interaction with Others:** While waiting, the author talked to a group of women and, when asked, went into the peep show booth with one of them (a stranger), rather than alone.

4. **Disclosure:** The author told their girlfriend exactly what happened, including going in with another woman.

5. **Girlfriend’s Reaction:** Initially, the girlfriend seemed to joke about it, but later expressed that she was not okay with the author going in with another woman.

6. **Author’s Justification:** The author feels that if the girlfriend had come in, the situation wouldn’t have happened, implying some blame on the girlfriend.

**Fault Analysis:**

- The girlfriend set a clear boundary: she didn’t want to go in, but was okay with the author going alone.
- The author respected the boundary about going in, but then crossed a new, unspoken boundary by going in with another woman. Even if it was innocent, this is a different situation than going in alone, and could reasonably make a partner uncomfortable.
- The author’s justification that “if she had just come in with me none of this would've happened” shifts responsibility away from their own actions, which is not fair. The author made the choice to go in with another woman.

**Conclusion:**  
The author is at fault for not considering how going in with another woman (even platonically) could be perceived differently than going in alone, and for shifting blame onto the girlfriend for not joining. The girlfriend’s feelings are valid, and the author should take responsibility for their own choices.",stop,720,416,1136

**Reasoning:**
- Your girlfriend changed the plan and invited her family over to your shared space without checking with you first, knowing you had an important exam and needed to study. This is inconsiderate.
- You declined to join her family for dinner, which is understandable given your exam, but you also acknowledge you haven’t been warm or responsive to her family, which may contribute to her feeling hurt or unsupported.
- Communication between both of you broke down: she became defensive, and you felt at a loss for words.

- The author’s decision to stop visiting their father and, later, to pursue college is a reasonable response to the environment described.
- The father and stepmother’s reaction—accusing the author of manipulation and kicking them out for choosing college—demonstrates a lack of support and understanding.
- The author is not at fault for prioritizing their well-being and future.
- The fault lies with the father and stepmother for their treatment and unsupportive behavior.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is asking if they are at fault (an ""asshole"") for not wanting to donate to a charity (NRA) that goes against their beliefs, even though it was the family's request.
- The author is not criticizing the family or the deceased, just expressing discomfort with the specific charity.
- The author is empathetic, reached out to the girlfriend, and is considering how to be respectful.
- There is no indication of rudeness or disrespect in their actions or intentions.
- People are not obligated to donate to causes they fundamentally disagree with, even in memorial situations.
- The family is not at fault for choosing a charity that reflects the deceased's interests.
- The author is not at fault for choosing not to donate to a cause they don't support.
- No one is being harmed or acting maliciously.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Mother's Actions:** The mother is being inconsistent and perhaps manipulative in her communication about money, but she is not obligated to spend her money in any particular way. Her choice to help another family is generous, even if her communication with her own children is lacking in honesty or tact.

2. **Children's Reactions:** The siblings (including the author) are understandably frustrated by the mixed messages and the feeling of being emotionally neglected, especially given their mother's history. However, their responses, while perhaps blunt, are not out of line—they are expressing their feelings about her behavior.

3. **Author's Feelings:** The author is self-aware about their own financial struggles and acknowledges that some of their feelings are about money, but also about emotional neglect. The author did not act maliciously, and even helped their mother deliver gifts to the other family.

4. **The Other Family:** The family receiving help is not at fault for accepting generosity or for asking for help again.

5. **Fault Assessment:** There is no clear ""fault"" in the sense of wrongdoing. The mother could communicate better, but her actions are not malicious. The children are expressing valid feelings. No one is acting with clear malice or irresponsibility.

**Conclusion:** This is a situation of miscommunication, unmet emotional needs, and complicated family dynamics, but not one where anyone is truly ""at fault"" in a moral sense.

- She gave you a GameCube, but it was missing cables/power. She apologized and gave you a controller to make up for it. You accepted graciously.
- You tried to make the gift work, but found it difficult to get the necessary parts.
- You asked your girlfriend if she would be offended if you bought another GameCube; she explicitly said she would not be offended and even suggested using hers as a backup.
- Your housemates think you are ungrateful, but your girlfriend (the gift-giver) is not offended.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is upset because his wife was not truthful about her sexual past.
- However, the wife may have felt shame or fear of judgment, which is common regarding sensitive topics like sexual history.
- The author is considering separation not because of current infidelity or betrayal, but because he feels less ""special"" due to her past.
- The wife's past actions occurred before their relationship, and she has not wronged the author during their marriage.
- The author is reacting harshly to information that does not directly affect their current relationship, and is prioritizing his feelings of ""specialness"" over empathy and communication.
- While honesty is important, the author's response is disproportionate and lacks understanding.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author and their best friend (who is straight) became close over 5 months.
   - Their friendship included some flirtatious behavior, but the friend maintained some boundaries.
   - The author, as a joke but with real intent, invited the friend to be ""friends with benefits.""
   - The friend agreed, and they had sex.
   - The author told several friends about the encounter.
   - After a week, the friend blocked the author on social media and has not spoken to them since.
   - The author apologized in real life, but the friend still refuses to talk.

2. **Key Issues:**  
   - The friend agreed to sex and was enthusiastic, so consent was present.
   - The author shared details of their sexual encounter with ""half of my friends,"" which is a significant breach of privacy.
   - The friend’s reaction (blocking and cutting off contact) happened after the author told others about the encounter.

3. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The friend is not at fault for agreeing to sex or for later feeling uncomfortable and ending the friendship.
   - The author is at fault for sharing private, intimate details about the encounter with many people, violating the friend's trust and privacy.
   - The author acknowledges this mistake: ""I know I shouldn't have done that especially for something so private, but I was just so happy that no amount of common sense made me do the most reasonable thing to do.""

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The main issue is the breach of privacy, not the initial sexual encounter.
   - The author’s actions directly led to the breakdown of the friendship.

Therefore, the author is at fault.

Based on the situation described, the author made reasonable accommodations for her boyfriend's interests, even participating in activities she wasn't personally interested in (e.g., sex in fursuits, tolerating the fursuit at home). The conflict arose when the boyfriend wanted to wear the fursuit to a social event with the author's friends and family, which she declined for understandable social reasons. The boyfriend's reaction—accusing her of being intolerant, using harsh language, demanding she buy an expensive fursuit, and guilt-tripping her after the breakup—was disproportionate and unreasonable.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The situation describes a long-standing friendship where playful roasting is a normal part of interaction.
- The friend frequently boasts about his intelligence, which can be annoying, but is not inherently malicious.
- During a mutual roast session, the author used a harsh but common roast joke targeting the friend's ego and self-perceived intelligence.
- The friend became genuinely upset, and the author doubled down by questioning his intelligence more directly.
- While the author's comments were pointed, they were made in the context of mutual roasting, and the friend had also made a personal joke about the author's body.
- No one in the situation acted with clear malice or crossed an obvious line of cruelty outside the established dynamic of their friendship.
- The friend's arrogance may be grating, but the author's response was proportionate to the context.

Therefore, while feelings were hurt, this seems to be a case of mutual banter that went a bit too far for one party, not a clear case of fault.

Step by step reasoning:
- The author clearly communicated a boundary: they did not want to participate in the snow fight and warned of a violent reaction if targeted.
- One friend ignored this and rubbed snow in the author's face, which is disrespectful and provokes a reaction.
- However, the author's response—punching the friend three times in the head, causing them to fall—was a disproportionate and violent escalation.
- Physical violence, especially to this degree, is not justified as a response to a non-violent prank, even if the author warned about it.
- The friend was wrong to ignore the boundary, but the author is at fault for the excessive and harmful response.

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Author's Actions:** The author has a very close relationship with a female best friend, which predates his relationship with his fiancée. He has not been transparent or sensitive enough to his fiancée's feelings, especially by calling his best friend his ""soul mate"" and telling his fiancée that he loves both women. This is likely to be very hurtful and confusing for a romantic partner, especially in the context of an engagement.

2. **Fiancée's Actions:** The fiancée has expressed discomfort with the author's friendship, which is understandable to a degree, but she escalated the situation by being hostile and making the best friend cry at dinner. She also asked the author not to invite his best friend to the wedding, which is a significant demand and could be seen as controlling.

3. **Best Friend's Actions:** The best friend does not appear to have done anything wrong in this scenario, but her presence and closeness to the author is a source of tension.

4. **Communication Issues:** There is a lack of open, honest, and empathetic communication between the author and his fiancée. The author avoids the subject, and the fiancée resorts to emotional displays and ultimatums.

5. **Fault Assessment:** Both the author and his fiancée have contributed to the conflict. The author is at fault for not setting clear boundaries and for making statements that would understandably hurt his fiancée. The fiancée is at fault for her hostile behavior and for trying to exclude the best friend without working through her feelings in a healthy way.

- Regardless of the misinformation, the author made the choice to sabotage the food, which is unethical and could be dangerous.

- The author is being reasonable in their concerns and is not acting maliciously or irresponsibly.
- There is no indication that ""everybody"" is at fault, nor that ""nobody"" is at fault, as the roommate's actions are the root of the problem.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**
This situation is complex and emotionally charged, but based on the information provided, it does not appear that anyone is objectively ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. The author is describing a friendship that has become stressful and difficult, with patterns of behavior from the friend that are overwhelming and possibly unhealthy for both parties. The author is considering setting boundaries or distancing themselves, which is a reasonable and healthy response to feeling trapped or pressured in a relationship.

The friend may be struggling with her own issues (possibly related to her transition, past friendship trauma, or other factors), but that does not make the author at fault for wanting to protect their own well-being. Similarly, the friend is not necessarily ""at fault"" for her feelings or needs, even if her behavior is difficult to manage.

Therefore, in this context, **nobody is strictly ""at fault""**—this is a case of a friendship that may no longer be working for either party, and it is reasonable for the author to consider stepping back.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The professor suffered a serious injury, which is a legitimate and unfortunate circumstance that can impact their ability to perform their duties.
2. However, the university (or department) has a responsibility to ensure that courses are delivered as promised, including timely grading and feedback, especially when students' academic progress and financial investment are at stake.
3. The student (author) was polite and understanding, waited several weeks, and only reached out after a significant delay that could have affected their academic decisions (e.g., dropping the course).
4. The professor's response was described as ""furious,"" which seems disproportionate to a reasonable and respectful inquiry from a student.
5. Ultimately, the lack of a contingency plan (such as a substitute grader, teaching assistant, or temporary instructor) is a failure of the university's administration and/or the department, not the student.
6. The student is not at fault for requesting feedback or for being concerned about their academic standing.

- The father is not at fault for his illness, and his behavior is a symptom of his untreated condition.
- The author is following medical advice to protect their own well-being, which is a reasonable and healthy boundary.
- The author is not being malicious or neglectful; they are simply unable to provide the level of care their father wants, and are not responsible for his treatment.
- The situation is difficult and sad, but there is no clear wrongdoing or malice from any party.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author is frustrated with their roommate for allowing friends to be in the house when the roommate is not present.
   - The friends use the main bathroom, which the author maintains.
   - The author feels uncomfortable with unaccompanied guests in the house.

2. **Fault Assessment:**  
   - The author is not *doing* anything yet; they are asking if they would be the jerk (""WIBTA"") for setting a boundary.
   - The roommate is acting within the lease agreement (the friend having a key is allowed), but the *spirit* of the agreement (key for emergencies) is being stretched.
   - The roommate's guests are using shared spaces, which is common in shared housing, but the author feels their privacy and comfort are being compromised.

3. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The author is not at fault for *considering* setting a boundary or for feeling uncomfortable.
   - The roommate is arguably inconsiderate, but not necessarily ""at fault"" in a rule-breaking sense, unless the lease or house rules specify otherwise.
   - The guests are acting as permitted by the roommate.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - No one is strictly ""at fault"" yet; this is a situation of mismatched expectations and boundaries, not clear wrongdoing.

You are the speech captain, which gives you a position of leadership and responsibility, especially toward new team members.

As a leader, it's important to balance honesty with empathy, particularly when someone is vulnerable. The fact that she walked away feeling hurt and said you had ""no feelings"" suggests your approach was lacking in necessary empathy and support.

Neither party acted with ill intent; both wanted to enjoy the holiday decorations, but their communication styles and priorities clashed. The author could have checked one more time before starting, and the husband could have been clearer about his intentions or made more effort to participate.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**

Step by step:

1. **Context:** The author is a coach running a serious self-defense class. A disruptive participant is skeptical, sarcastic, and not engaging fully, which affects others' learning.

2. **Action:** The author singles her out for a demonstration, after she agrees, and physically overpowers her in front of the class to show the reality of an attack.

3. **Aftermath:** The participant feels humiliated and helpless, tells the author, and leaves with her friend. The author feels bad but justifies the action as standard practice and necessary for learning.

4. **Fault Analysis:**
   - The participant was disruptive and dismissive, which is rude and unhelpful, but not a justification for public humiliation.
   - The author, as the person in authority, escalated the situation by using a hands-on demonstration specifically with the disruptive participant, in front of the class, knowing she was skeptical and not fully consenting in spirit (even if she verbally agreed).
   - The author did not consider the power dynamic, the potential for humiliation, or the emotional impact, especially given the sensitive nature of self-defense training for women.

5. **Conclusion:** While the participant was rude, the author is at fault for using their authority to make a point at her expense, rather than de-escalating or handling the disruption in a less confrontational way. The author’s intent may have been educational, but the execution was insensitive and resulted in harm.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The situation is a classic case of miscommunication between friends.
- The author found the shirt and was considering buying it, but let the friend try it on.
- The phrase ""up to him"" was interpreted differently by each party: the author meant it about fit, the friend took it as permission to buy.
- There was no explicit agreement or clear communication about ""dibs"" or intent to buy.
- The author ultimately convinced the friend to let them buy it, but the friend is upset.
- There is no clear malice, deception, or violation of an explicit agreement by either party.
- The conflict arose from ambiguous communication, not from anyone acting in bad faith.

Therefore, while feelings are hurt, nobody is truly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense—it's a misunderstanding.",stop,434,180,614

- The ""good looking guy"" was simply given an opportunity to have dinner; there is no indication of harm or deceit.
- The author apologized and explained his actions, and the coworker accepted this and continued to see him.

- Everyone has the right to set boundaries about what they share, especially regarding images of themselves.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is asking if they are wrong (""AITA"") for thinking their boyfriend is moving on and that he is in the wrong (""ITA"").
- The boyfriend has made it clear he wants to move out, possibly without the author, and has even said he might find a new girlfriend.
- The boyfriend is making choices that prioritize his own desires and independence, and his communication seems insensitive (telling the author to ""deal with it"").
- The author is not at fault for feeling hurt or for interpreting the boyfriend's actions as moving on.
- The boyfriend's actions (and words) are inconsiderate and suggest he is at fault for the hurt caused.

**Reasoning:**
- The author acted reasonably in both situations: 
  - Politely informing a roommate about a persistent odor (which is a shared living concern).
  - Turning off an unattended heater that was causing a smoky smell (a potential fire hazard and shared safety concern).
- The roommate responded with disproportionate hostility, passive-aggressive behavior, and escalated the situation by calling campus police and making threatening comments.
- The author did not violate privacy or act maliciously; their actions were motivated by shared living standards and safety.
- The roommate's actions (ignoring hygiene, leaving a heater on unattended, threatening violence, and escalating to authorities without cause) are inappropriate and at fault.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The situation describes a family Christmas that feels inauthentic and unsatisfying to the author, who is frustrated by the lack of genuine sentiment, the commercialized nature of the holiday, and the performative aspects of gift-giving.
- The author expresses resentment about being included in gift-giving when they did not participate, and about being criticized for their coping mechanisms (drinking, withdrawing).
- The family as a whole seems to be going through the motions of a holiday none of them truly value, but there is no clear evidence of malicious intent or direct harm.
- The issues described are rooted in miscommunication, mismatched expectations, and perhaps a lack of emotional connection, but not in anyone doing something objectively ""wrong"" or blameworthy.
- The author is venting frustration, but their actions (not buying gifts, not wanting to participate, drinking, withdrawing) are understandable given the context, and the family's actions (labeling gifts, expecting participation) are also understandable, if misguided.
- This is a situation of mutual dissatisfaction and dysfunction, but not clear fault.

- The girlfriend made a reasonable request based on her discomfort with the noise, not understanding the consequences for the fish.
- The author explained why the filters could not be turned off, which is reasonable and responsible for the fish.
- However, when the girlfriend continued to express discomfort, the author escalated the situation by making a sarcastic and dismissive comment (""you can go sleep outside in the -20 Celsius degree weather""), which is unnecessarily harsh and unkind.
- The author then further dismissed her feelings in the morning, showing little empathy for her experience.
- While the girlfriend could have been more understanding about the fish, the author’s response was disproportionate and dismissive, making them primarily at fault for the conflict escalation and lack of empathy.

- Your sister-in-law scheduled a last-minute birthday party for her daughter (L) on the same day, despite knowing it was your daughter's birthday and that you had plans.
- You communicated your reasons for not attending clearly: prior commitments and the importance of your daughter's special day.
- Your sister-in-law repeatedly called and pressured you to attend, which is inconsiderate given the circumstances.
- There is no indication that you were rude or dismissive; you simply prioritized your daughter's birthday.

You asked your friends if they were okay with your wife joining the group season ticket arrangement. One friend expressed that he valued the group as ""guy time"" and didn't want to change the dynamic. You respected this by not pushing for your wife to join the group account. Instead, you started your own account and bought separate tickets, which did not affect the original group or their arrangement.

Now, your friend is upset that you ""ignored"" their response, but in reality, you did not force your wife into the group or change their setup—you simply made a separate arrangement for yourself and your wife. Your actions were considerate and respected their wishes.

**Reasoning:**

- **Author:** The author did not proactively communicate with his girlfriend about hanging out with a female friend, especially given the context that this has been an issue in the past. While he may not have intended anything inappropriate, a lack of transparency can understandably make a partner feel uncomfortable or insecure, especially if there’s a history of jealousy.
- **Girlfriend:** The girlfriend’s reaction was excessive and involved berating and sending repeated messages, which is not a healthy way to express concern or jealousy. While her feelings are valid, her method of communication was not constructive.
- **Summary:** Both parties contributed to the conflict: the author by not being upfront, and the girlfriend by responding in a way that escalated the situation rather than resolving it. Both could have handled the situation better.

- The mother is disregarding the author’s age, autonomy, and personal feelings about having children.
- The author responded by telling their mother to ""shut up"" about the topic, which could be considered rude, but was a reaction to repeated, inappropriate pressure.
- The mother escalated the situation by calling the author selfish for not wanting to have children, which is unreasonable and emotionally manipulative.
- The author acknowledges that their response could have been more tactful, but the primary fault lies with the mother for her persistent and inappropriate behavior.

It seems worse ...",Other,Other,0.95,1.0,True,"This is a complex and emotionally charged situation involving mental health, relationship dynamics, and financial stress. Let’s break it down step by step:

1. **Mental Health:** The husband has struggled with depression for a long time, refuses therapy or medication, and his behavior (anger, withdrawal, lack of support) is affecting the marriage and family.
2. **Relationship Dynamics:** The author feels neglected, unsupported, and sometimes afraid to ""stir the pot"" due to his anger. She has made efforts to communicate and seek help (counseling, moving out, asking for support).
3. **Financial Issues:** The husband initially refused to share assets or provide adequate financial support, despite a significant income disparity and shared childcare responsibilities.
4. **Recent Improvements:** After counseling, there was some improvement, but the husband's depression and related behaviors have resurfaced.
5. **Author’s Dilemma:** The author is torn between compassion for his illness and the toll it takes on her own well-being.

**Fault Analysis:**
- The husband is responsible for refusing to seek help for his depression, for his anger, and for not providing adequate emotional and financial support.
- The author has made efforts to address the issues, seek help, and communicate her needs.
- Depression is an illness, but refusing treatment and taking out anger on others is not excused by illness alone.
- The situation is not the author’s fault, nor is it a case where ""everybody"" is equally at fault.

**Conclusion:**  
The husband (other) is primarily at fault for refusing help, not managing his illness, and for his treatment of the author.

- The author is communicating her feelings and boundaries, which is reasonable.
- The boyfriend's response to her concerns is dismissive and verbally aggressive (""told to fuck off"").

Many students use their funds for a variety of personal expenses, and sending a small amount to help family is not ""embezzlement"" or illegal. Your friend is upset because she feels her parents' taxes are being misused, but the system is designed to support students broadly, not to micromanage their spending.

The nephew's behavior may be a result of instability, lack of consistent parenting, or emotional distress, none of which are his fault.

Step by step reasoning:

1. **Author's actions:** The author has a close friendship with a coworker, involving teasing, inside jokes, and some flirtatious behavior at work. She has made him food, given him rides, and had lunch with him. She acknowledges that sometimes the behavior has been ""a bit too close"" and ""flirty,"" but insists she has not crossed a line or cheated.

2. **Boyfriend's actions:** The boyfriend has apparently been uncomfortable with the closeness between the author and her coworker for some time, but did not communicate his feelings until the spaghetti incident. He is now expressing his discomfort and frustration, possibly in a way that feels overwhelming or accusatory to the author.

   - The author is at fault to some degree for not recognizing or addressing how her actions might be perceived by her boyfriend, especially given the flirtatious nature of the friendship and the ongoing jokes about marriage and babies.
   - The boyfriend is at fault for not communicating his feelings earlier and letting resentment build up, and for possibly overreacting or not trusting the author.
   - Both parties could have handled the situation with better communication and clearer boundaries.

4. **Conclusion:** Both the author and her boyfriend share responsibility for the situation due to a lack of communication and unclear boundaries. The coworker and other colleagues are not at fault, as they are not in the relationship.

**Reasoning:**  
You are not at fault for clarifying that English is your first language and that you were born and raised in America. The compliment, while well-intentioned, is based on an assumption about your background. Responding honestly and with a little humor is not rude, especially since you have previously tried to avoid awkwardness by just thanking people, which led to more confusion and discomfort. Your friend may have felt your response was abrupt, but you did not insult or belittle anyone; you simply clarified a misunderstanding. The people giving the compliment are also not at fault—they are making a common assumption based on your appearance and location, not out of malice.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**
- James and Emma both engaged in consensual sex and took reasonable precautions (pill & condoms), but contraception is not 100% effective.
- Emma has the right to decide whether to continue the pregnancy or not; James can express his wishes, but cannot force her.
- James' family expectations and inheritance issues are not Emma's responsibility.
- While James' behavior (seeing other women, not being clear about the relationship) may be considered ""dickish,"" it is not directly relevant to fault in the pregnancy or the abortion decision.
- There is no evidence of coercion, deception about contraception, or other unethical behavior directly related to the pregnancy itself.
- The argument is a result of a difficult situation, but neither party is clearly ""at fault"" for the pregnancy or for having conflicting desires about what to do next.

- The girl avoids him, which is her prerogative; she is not obligated to dance or interact further.
- The author, feeling slighted, chooses to confront her at the end of the night and tells her to ""go fuck herself.""
- This response is disproportionate and hostile, especially since the girl did not directly insult or harm the author—she simply avoided him.
- While the girl's avoidance may be frustrating or confusing, it is not inherently wrong or malicious.
- The author's verbal outburst is inappropriate and makes him at fault for escalating the situation with rudeness and hostility.

1. **Summary of Actions:**  
   - The author intentionally tried to derail a colleague's project to improve their own chances of getting a job offer.
   - The author withheld information and progress, despite being involved in the project and having the expertise the colleague lacked.
   - The author admits to sabotaging the project for personal gain.

2. **Ethical Considerations:**  
   - Sabotaging a colleague's work for personal benefit is unethical.
   - Withholding information and not collaborating, especially when the other person is dependent on your expertise, is unprofessional.
   - The author’s actions directly harmed another intern’s chances and the quality of the project.

   - The author is fully aware of their actions and motives.
   - There is no indication that the colleague or manager acted inappropriately or contributed to the situation in a way that would share the blame.

- The author checked in with her before acting on the agreement, showing respect for her feelings.

Step by step reasoning:
- The author is not at fault for politely asking a neighbor to turn down music that is extremely loud, even if it is outside of official quiet hours. Excessive noise that penetrates into other apartments can be considered inconsiderate at any time.
- The neighbor is not necessarily at fault either, as they did comply immediately both times and did not respond with hostility. They may not have realized how loud the music was.
- There is no evidence of malice or unreasonable behavior from either party. The author did not demand silence, just a reduction in volume, and the neighbor complied.
- This is a common neighborly issue and both parties acted reasonably.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault for several reasons:

1. **Disregard for Tenant's Request:** The tenant specifically asked the author not to let the cat into the bedrooms. The author ignored this request without a valid reason, which is disrespectful and could be seen as a violation of the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment of their home.

2. **Assumptions Without Evidence:** The author assumed the cat is damaging the property without any evidence, and threatened to raise the rent or evict the tenant based on hypothetical future damages. This is not a fair or legal basis for such actions.

3. **Threatening Retaliation:** Threatening to raise rent or evict a tenant because of a pet that has been there for 15 years, especially when the pet is for an autistic child, could be considered retaliatory and potentially discriminatory under fair housing laws.

4. **Lack of Empathy:** The author dismisses the importance of the cat to the tenant's autistic daughter without understanding the situation, showing a lack of empathy and consideration.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is a 20-year-old college student living at home, working part-time, contributing financially and with labor to the household, and generally being responsible.
- The parents pay for college, but the author has offered to pay, and they declined.
- The mother is strict about certain rules (e.g., not allowing the author to spend the night at his girlfriend's), while the father is indifferent but defers to the mother.
- The author feels he should have more autonomy given his age, contributions, and responsibilities.
- The author is not being disrespectful or neglectful; he is simply seeking more independence.
- The parents are not being abusive or unreasonable in a way that would make them clearly ""at fault""—they are enforcing their own house rules, which is common, though perhaps strict.
- There is no clear wrongdoing or harm; this is a typical family dynamic involving boundaries and independence.

Therefore, nobody is clearly ""at fault""—this is a situation of differing expectations and generational perspectives, not one of blame.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is hosting in their own home and has a reasonable expectation to not have to lock up their small, non-aggressive dog for guests, especially when the dog lives there.
- The sister and niece have a strong aversion/fear of dogs, which has been enabled by the rest of the family always accommodating them. This has not helped the niece overcome her fear.
- The author’s fiancé chose to put the dog away to avoid drama, but the author disagreed and let the dog out, which is within their rights in their own home.
- The sister escalated the situation by yelling, cursing, and insulting the author and the dog, which is inappropriate, but likely comes from frustration and a pattern of being accommodated elsewhere.
- The author did not escalate, simply asked them to leave, and did not engage in the argument.

While the sister’s behavior is rude, the core issue is a clash of expectations and boundaries, not a clear moral failing. The author is not at fault for not wanting to lock up their dog in their own home, and the sister is not at fault for wanting to protect her child from something she fears, though her reaction is excessive. The real problem is a lack of communication and boundary-setting in the family, not a single person’s fault.

Therefore, nobody is truly at fault in a way that makes them the sole or primary wrongdoer. This is a situation of mismatched expectations and poor communication, not clear wrongdoing.",stop,886,315,1201

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author and friends are discussing post-high school plans.
   - ""L"" says they want to be an engineer without a degree, just with high school co-op experience.
   - The author bluntly tells L that’s not possible, and L gets upset.
   - The author asks if they were the ""asshole"" for saying this.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - L’s plan is unrealistic, but it’s their own life and choice.
   - The author’s comment (“just because you believe the world is one way, doesn’t mean it is”) is blunt and dismissive.
   - The author admits to being bothered by L’s “holier than thou” attitude, which may have influenced their tone.
   - The author’s delivery hurt L’s feelings, even if the information was factually correct.

3. **Social Context:**  
   - It’s generally okay to give honest advice, but tone and delivery matter, especially among friends.
   - The author’s approach was unnecessarily harsh and dismissive, rather than supportive or constructive.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for how they communicated, not for the content of their advice.
   - L’s unrealistic expectations are not the author’s responsibility, but the author could have handled the conversation more kindly.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The girlfriend is at fault for putting up intimate pictures (including kissing) of her ex and his belongings in shared spaces, especially after a fight, which is insensitive to the current partner and confusing for their child.
- The author is not at fault for being hurt or upset by this, as it is a reasonable emotional response.
- However, the girlfriend found the author's box of ex memorabilia (albeit tucked away and forgotten), and she was wrong to throw out his things without his knowledge or consent.
- Both parties have acted in ways that are inconsiderate to each other’s feelings and boundaries: the girlfriend by displaying her ex’s things so openly, and the author by (even if unintentionally) keeping mementos from a past relationship.
- The situation is exacerbated by poor communication and mutual disrespect of boundaries.

Final Answer: Everybody

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Friend's Actions:**  
   - The friend asked a stranger about her drink.  
   - When she did not respond, he tapped her on the shoulder to get her attention.  
   - In a bar, touching a stranger without consent, even on the shoulder, can be considered inappropriate, especially given social norms around personal space and consent.  
   - However, the friend apologized immediately when she reacted negatively.

2. **Woman's Reaction:**  
   - She responded very strongly, loudly accusing the friend of inappropriate behavior and even using the word ""rape,"" which is an extreme escalation for a shoulder tap.  
   - Her reaction, while possibly rooted in personal boundaries or past experiences, was disproportionate to the situation as described.

3. **Author's Actions:**  
   - The author intervened to defend the friend, minimizing the woman's reaction and questioning why it was a big deal.  
   - This could be seen as invalidating the woman's feelings and escalating the situation further, rather than de-escalating or simply apologizing and moving on.

4. **Bartender/Bar Staff:**  
   - The staff sided with the woman, enforcing a policy of not touching patrons without consent.  
   - They asked both the author and the friend to leave, citing that their presence was making others uncomfortable.  
   - The staff's response was firm, perhaps a bit rude, but within their rights to maintain a comfortable environment for all patrons.

5. **Fault Assessment:**  
   - The friend was at fault for touching a stranger without consent, even if the intent was innocent.  
   - The woman was at fault for escalating the situation to an extreme degree and using inflammatory language.  
   - The author was at fault for not de-escalating and for challenging the bar's decision, which prolonged the conflict.  
   - The bar staff could have handled the explanation more diplomatically, but their primary responsibility is to the comfort and safety of their patrons.

**Conclusion:**  
Everyone involved contributed to the escalation and discomfort in the situation. The friend made a social misstep, the woman overreacted, the author failed to de-escalate, and the staff could have communicated more calmly. Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
Step by step:

1. **Author's Actions:** The author reminded his wife about her allergy and the Pepcid AC, and suggested she not drink for her own well-being and their plans. He did not forbid her or insist—he made a suggestion based on concern and past experience.
2. **Wife's Actions:** The wife made her own decision to order a drink anyway. She exercised her autonomy and was not coerced.
3. **Friend's Actions:** The friend overheard the conversation and interpreted the author's suggestion as controlling, confronting him about it. However, the friend did not have full context and may have misjudged the situation.

**Fault Analysis:**
- The author acted out of concern, not control, and respected his wife's choice.
- The wife made her own decision.
- The friend was trying to stand up for the wife but did so without full understanding.

**Conclusion:**  
No one is truly at fault here. The author was not controlling, the wife was not pressured, and the friend, while perhaps overstepping, was acting on a misunderstanding rather than malice. This is a case of miscommunication and differing perspectives, not wrongdoing.",stop,569,255,824

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is not smoking weed around his wife or kids, and is using his own late-night time for his habit, which he enjoys and which was part of his life before their relationship.
- The wife is upset because his late-night routine (falling asleep on the couch, coming to bed late) disrupts her sleep, which is a valid concern, especially as a light sleeper and a parent.
- The author has tried coming to bed at her time, but it makes him miserable and resentful, which is not sustainable for his well-being.
- The wife feels compelled to wake him up or is disturbed when he comes to bed late, but she could potentially let him sleep on the couch and not wake him, or they could work together to find a compromise (e.g., he sets an alarm to come to bed at a certain time, or they agree he sleeps on the couch if he falls asleep there).
- Both have communicated but reached an impasse, and both have valid needs and frustrations.

Therefore, both parties are contributing to the problem by not finding a workable compromise and by holding firm to their own preferences without fully accommodating the other's needs. This makes it a shared issue.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Initial Situation:** The author arrives on time, looks for his wife in a crowded restaurant, and eventually finds her. She is already seated and sharing a table with strangers.

2. **Wife's Reaction:** Upon his arrival, the wife immediately criticizes him harshly (""That was the most pathetic thing I've ever seen"") for not spotting her sooner. She continues to insult him, calling him dumb and arguing with him in front of others.

3. **Author's Response:** The author tries to explain his actions calmly, suggests that they should be nice to each other since it's a date, and gives a clear boundary: if she continues to be mean, he will leave.

4. **Escalation:** The wife continues to be hostile, and the author follows through on his boundary by leaving.

5. **Aftermath:** The wife accuses the author of being an ""asshole"" for leaving her.

**Fault Analysis:**
- The author made a reasonable effort to find his wife in a crowded place and was not late.
- The wife's reaction was disproportionate, insulting, and public, escalating a minor issue into a confrontation.
- The author set a clear, reasonable boundary and left when it was not respected.
- There is no indication that the author endangered his wife by leaving, as the restaurant is close to home.

**Conclusion:** The wife is at fault for her unnecessarily harsh and insulting behavior, both privately and publicly, and for refusing to de-escalate when given the opportunity. The author’s actions were reasonable and assertive without being aggressive.

- The acquaintance is persistent but not aggressive, and the author has not fully committed to hosting.
- The author plans to politely decline, which is a reasonable and honest course of action.
- The acquaintance is simply trying to recruit for her business, which, while potentially annoying, is not inherently unethical or malicious in this context.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The author describes a situation where her husband has repeatedly failed at business ventures, is depressed, and wants to try again. She is the higher earner and wants to be practical about their future, especially as they plan to have children.
2. When her husband expresses his feelings of failure and desire to do something meaningful, she tells him to quit his job and be a stay-at-home father, implying that his business ideas are not viable and that he should give up on them.
3. Her husband is deeply hurt by this, feeling unsupported and possibly emasculated, and leaves after the conversation.
4. The author’s sister tells her that her approach was rude.

Analysis:
- The author’s intentions may have been practical and even caring (wanting him to avoid more failure and depression), but the way she communicated her thoughts was dismissive and unsupportive.
- She invalidated his ambitions and feelings at a vulnerable moment, rather than offering empathy or a more constructive discussion about their future.
- While the husband has made poor financial decisions, in this specific interaction, the author’s words and approach were unnecessarily harsh and likely contributed to his distress.

- Dan later passed away due to a terminal illness, which was not disclosed to him or his classmates at the request of his parents.
- The author questions whether it was right for the teacher to have him help Dan, knowing Dan was terminally ill, and also questions the parents' decision not to tell Dan about his prognosis.
- The author asks if they are ""the asshole"" for their actions or feelings.

Analysis:
- The author did nothing wrong; they helped a classmate as requested and had no knowledge of Dan's prognosis.
- The teacher followed the parents' wishes and tried to give Dan as normal a school experience as possible.
- The parents made a difficult decision, likely with Dan's best interests at heart, and this is a complex ethical issue with no clear right or wrong.

**Reasoning:**
- The author’s initial action (tickling, picking up girlfriend to dance) was playful and not malicious, and he even acknowledges in hindsight that maybe he shouldn’t have forced her to get up, but there’s no indication of ill intent or escalation.
- The girlfriend’s response (smashing a cupcake in his face, especially after the earlier cupcake incident) was disproportionate, especially since the author was not expecting it and was embarrassed by it.
- The friends’ actions (trying to take pictures, picking the bathroom lock) further invaded the author’s privacy and boundaries.
- The girlfriend’s refusal to apologize and her dismissive attitude toward the author’s feelings show a lack of empathy and respect for his boundaries.
- The author’s reaction (removing himself from the situation, expressing anger, cursing) was a response to being embarrassed and having his boundaries crossed, which is understandable.

Step by step reasoning:
- The author’s boyfriend gave a compliment (“you look pretty and beautiful”).
- The author, triggered by past trauma, responded by saying he reminds her of her ex, which upset him.
- The boyfriend responded with frustration, pointing out that he doesn’t like being compared to an ex and expressing annoyance that the author hasn’t moved on.
- The author got upset and left, and the boyfriend hasn’t apologized.

Analysis:
- The boyfriend’s initial action (giving a compliment) was positive and not at fault.
- The author’s response, while understandable due to trauma, was hurtful and unfair to the boyfriend, as he was not responsible for the ex’s actions.
- The boyfriend’s reaction was blunt and perhaps lacking in empathy, but it was a response to being unfairly compared to someone who hurt the author.
- The core issue is the author projecting past trauma onto the current boyfriend and vocalizing it in a way that hurt him.

Final Answer: Everybody

**Reasoning:**

- **You/Author:** You brought a dog over without explicitly informing your roommate, even though the house is generally dog-friendly and this has been common practice. However, it’s still courteous to let all roommates know when a new dog is coming, especially if it’s not one of the regular six.
- **Roommate (A):** He waited until after the fact to express his frustration, and did so in a hostile, threatening manner rather than communicating calmly or earlier. This escalated the situation unnecessarily.
- **General dynamic:** There seems to be a lack of clear communication and boundaries about bringing new dogs into the house, despite the general dog-friendly atmosphere.

**Summary:**  
Both sides contributed to the misunderstanding: you could have communicated more clearly, and your roommate could have handled his concerns more maturely. Therefore, ""Everybody"" is at fault to some degree.",stop,583,193,776

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The boyfriend (Will) is at fault for getting speeding tickets by driving significantly over the speed limit (20-30 mph over).
- The author acknowledges that Will is responsible for the tickets and that he should slow down.
- However, the author is now telling Will to drive faster than the speed limit in certain scenarios, even after he has received multiple tickets and is trying to avoid further penalties.
- The author is pressuring Will to speed up, which is both unsafe and could lead to more tickets.
- While Will may have overreacted by driving under the speed limit, it is not unreasonable for him to be cautious after multiple tickets.
- The author is at fault for encouraging unsafe and illegal driving behavior, especially after the consequences have been made clear.

Therefore, the author is at fault for telling Will to drive faster when he is trying to avoid further tickets.",stop,1249,192,1441

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author broke up with their girlfriend because they realized they are gay. This is a matter of personal identity and honesty, not malice or wrongdoing.
- The author did not disclose the real reason for the breakup due to legitimate fear of harassment in a religious high school environment. This is a reasonable concern for personal safety.
- The girlfriend is understandably hurt and upset, but her reaction is emotional and not a matter of fault.
- There is no evidence of intentional harm, betrayal, or malice from either party.
- The situation is sad and difficult, but not one where anyone is truly ""at fault."" It is a result of circumstances and personal truths.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author was approached with a request and politely declined, offering an alternative (contact info for someone else).
- When pressed, the author explained their reasoning in a tactful and honest way, without being rude or dismissive.
- The friend, while disappointed, was polite in her direct response but later vented in a private group, which led to others criticizing the author.
- The author did not insult, belittle, or act maliciously toward the friend or her children.
- The friend’s venting and the group’s piling on are unkind, but not directly the author’s fault.
- The situation is a result of mismatched expectations and feelings, not wrongdoing or malice.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is asking if they are ""the asshole"" for being upset about a colleague's behavior.
- The described colleague is ignoring emails, misattributing tasks, CCing superiors in a way that could be seen as undermining, and using a nickname the author does not prefer, despite being told otherwise.
- The author has not described any retaliatory or inappropriate behavior on their own part—only frustration and a desire for input.
- The problematic actions (ignoring communication, misassigning blame, using unwanted nicknames) are all being done by the colleague, not the author.
- Therefore, the person at fault in this situation is the colleague, not the author.

- The referees failed to control the game early, allowing things to escalate.
- Both teams started flopping and trying to draw penalties, contributing to the mess.
- While the opposing player’s actions were the worst, the author and others also contributed to the negative atmosphere and escalation.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author was frustrated by the early closure of the lifts due to wind, which is a safety issue outside anyone's control.
- The hotel and lift staff followed their stated policy (no refunds for weather-related closures), which is common in ski resorts.
- The author became insistent and argumentative, but ultimately apologized to the cashier for their behavior, showing self-awareness and remorse.
- The staff, while perhaps not the most empathetic, were following policy and safety protocols.
- The closure was due to weather, not negligence or malice.
- The author’s persistence led to a refund, but no one acted with clear malice or gross negligence.
- The situation was handled as best as possible given the circumstances, and the author made amends for any rudeness.

Therefore, while there was frustration and some heated exchanges, there is no clear ""fault"" in a moral or procedural sense—just a difficult situation handled imperfectly by all, but with no major wrongdoing.",stop,740,214,954

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is expressing distress about a friend's withdrawal during a difficult time, and is seeking clarity and reassurance, not demanding unreasonable things.
- The friend is dealing with mental health issues and is communicating their boundaries as best as they can, which is a healthy thing to do for themselves.
- The author is not at fault for having emotional needs or for feeling anxious about the lack of communication; these are natural feelings.
- The friend is not at fault for needing space or being unable to provide a concrete timeline for when they'll be ready to communicate again.
- The situation is difficult for both parties, but neither is acting maliciously or irresponsibly.
- The previous situation with the ex-friend may have been handled poorly (the author admits to a ""mental breakdown"" and telling the friend to get out of their life), but in the current situation, the author is seeking advice and self-reflecting, which is positive.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
This is a situation involving relationship dynamics, work-life balance, and expectations. The author is upset that their partner is working unpaid overtime and not prioritizing time together, especially when guests are coming over. The partner, on the other hand, is enjoying his new job, wants to make a good impression, and feels that working extra is part of the job culture.

- The author is not at fault for wanting to spend time with their partner or for being concerned about unpaid labor, especially since they share finances.
- The partner is not at fault for being enthusiastic about his new job and wanting to work hard, even if it means unpaid overtime, as this is common in some industries.
- There is a communication breakdown, but both parties have reasonable perspectives and neither is acting maliciously or unreasonably.
- The argument seems to stem from mismatched expectations and stress, not from anyone being objectively ""at fault.""

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Background:** The author is insecure about their drumming and has only played for their boyfriend a few times. The boyfriend is aware of this insecurity.
2. **Event:** The author sends a private video as a birthday gift. The boyfriend posts it publicly on Facebook, tagging the author.
3. **Reaction:** The author is mortified and asks for the video to be taken down. The boyfriend initially resists, then agrees, but later calls the author ""ridiculous"" for being upset.
4. **Fault Analysis:**
   - The author did not explicitly say ""don't share this,"" but the boyfriend knows about the author's insecurity and that the video was a personal gift.
   - The boyfriend did not ask for permission before posting, despite knowing the author's feelings.
   - The boyfriend dismisses the author's feelings and seeks validation from a friend, rather than apologizing or empathizing.

**Conclusion:**  
The boyfriend is at fault for sharing a private, personal gift without permission, especially given his knowledge of the author's insecurity. The author is not at fault for being upset or asking for the video to be taken down.

- The roommate (and her mother) bought tickets as a gift, expecting everyone to attend, but did not confirm interest or commitment from all parties before purchasing. This is also a lapse in communication and assumption.
- The roommate's reaction to the author's cancellation is understandable, but shaming and escalating the situation is not constructive.
- The author is dealing with a difficult week and has valid personal reasons for not wanting to attend, but last-minute cancellation is generally inconsiderate.
- Both parties could have handled the situation better: the author by communicating earlier, the roommate by not assuming attendance and by responding more empathetically.

Step by step reasoning:
- The author is upset that her sister's speech at her wedding focused on the sister's struggles and her relationship with the groom, rather than the bride herself.
- The author felt overshadowed and asked her sister to leave the wedding, which caused the sister distress.
- While it is understandable to feel hurt if a speech feels self-centered, the sister's speech also highlighted the groom's positive qualities and their supportiveness, which is relevant to a wedding.
- The author’s reaction—asking her sister to leave the wedding—was disproportionate and harsh, especially given the context of the speech and the positive reaction from other guests.

- There is a lack of clear communication and empathy on both sides: the author could have been more sensitive and direct, and the boyfriend could have been more understanding of her cultural background.

- Sarah is also at fault for engaging in emotionally and sexually intimate conversations with the author while still in a relationship, and for not setting boundaries with both her boyfriend and the author.
- Sarah's boyfriend's behavior (ignoring her, chatting with other girls) is described as upsetting to Sarah, but not necessarily as cheating or abuse, though it may have contributed to her seeking emotional support elsewhere.
- The author’s friend who called him an ""arse"" is not at fault; they simply gave their opinion.

- In relationships, especially marriage and parenting, compromise is important, and refusing to even consider alternatives is generally unreasonable.
- The fiance is not demanding only her way, but is offering middle-ground solutions.

- The children are extremely young (2-5 years old), and crying is developmentally normal at those ages.
- The parents may not be able to ""stifle"" the crying, and there's no evidence of neglect or malice—just normal family life.
- The author and roommate's actions are not just venting privately; they are actively directing negative comments at the neighbors, which is inappropriate and could be distressing or intimidating, especially to the parents or children.

- While the friend is also involved in spreading the information, the author was the original source and chose to disclose private matters that were not theirs alone to share.

- The fiancé (FH) is not at fault for wanting to maintain a relationship with the stepkids he helped raise, nor for scaling back contact as their behavior worsened.
- The stepkids, while young and possibly influenced by their upbringing and circumstances, are responsible for their own actions, especially as they are now 16 and 18. Their repeated disrespect, theft, and dangerous behavior (e.g., pop tart packaging) are not justified.
- The ex-wife appears to have enabled or encouraged the stepkids' negative behavior and used them to manipulate FH for money and favors.
- The situation is primarily the result of the stepkids' and ex-wife's actions, not the author or FH.

- The argument stems from a difference in comfort levels and communication, not malice or clear wrongdoing.
- Both parties have reasonable perspectives: the boyfriend sees the sheets as just stained but usable, the author sees them as unsanitary and emotionally uncomfortable.

Final Answer: Everybody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author’s Faults:**  
   - The author admits to a history of poor time management and being late, which has repeatedly upset his girlfriend. This pattern sets a precedent and contributes to the current dynamic.
   - The author also acknowledges feeling hurt about his girlfriend spending time with a male coworker, but recognizes that this is his own insecurity to manage.

2. **Girlfriend’s Faults:**  
   - The girlfriend changed plans last minute to spend time with a male coworker, which is not inherently wrong, but she was late as a result and did not communicate clearly about the delay until after the fact.
   - She has previously been upset with the author for being late, but now expects understanding when she is late herself, which is a double standard.
   - She admits she would be upset if the roles were reversed, acknowledging the unfairness.

3. **Double Standard:**  
   - Both parties are engaging in behaviors that upset the other, but expect more understanding when they are the ones at fault. This mutual lack of empathy and communication is a shared issue.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - Both the author and the girlfriend have contributed to the problem: the author by repeatedly being late and the girlfriend by not holding herself to the same standard she expects from him. The double standard and lack of clear communication are issues on both sides.

- The author is simply relaying the situation and not directly involved in the conflict.
- The brother is expressing his needs in a reasonable way and is not at fault for wanting better communication and support.

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author bought a gun and chose not to tell their roommate, knowing the roommate disapproves of guns. The author kept the gun locked up and did not leave it accessible.
- The roommate found out through a third party and reacted very strongly, calling the author names and demanding the gun be removed or the author move out.
- The author feels the reaction is excessive, especially since the gun is stored safely and there are no children in the home.

Fault analysis:
- The author is at some fault for not disclosing the presence of a firearm in a shared living space, especially knowing the roommate's strong feelings. In shared homes, major decisions that affect the sense of safety and comfort should be discussed, even if the item is legally owned and stored safely.
- The roommate is also at fault for reacting with name-calling and public shaming, rather than addressing the issue directly and respectfully. Demanding immediate removal or eviction without discussion is an extreme response.
- Both parties could have handled the situation with more communication and respect for each other's boundaries and concerns.

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
- The author made a loud, insensitive comment (""oh shit what a Legend"") in response to a story about someone being hurtful and disrespectful in relationships.
- This comment was overheard by the people involved in the story, understandably upsetting them.
- The bartender, likely aiming to maintain a safe and respectful environment, asked the author to leave after the situation escalated.
- While the lady's reaction (throwing a glass) was extreme, the initial fault lies with the author for making an inappropriate comment in a public setting, especially about a sensitive topic.
- The author’s actions directly caused the escalation, so the author is primarily at fault.",stop,340,148,488

Final Answer: Author

Step by step reasoning:
- The author was bothered by another person's body odor in a public study space.
- The author directly asked the person to put on deodorant and offered some if he didn't have any.
- This request was made in a public setting, which could be considered embarrassing or insensitive.
- The reaction from others (""a lot of people looked a bit weird to me"") suggests that the author's approach was socially inappropriate.
- While the discomfort is understandable, addressing personal hygiene issues with strangers in public is generally considered rude or tactless.
- The other person did not do anything intentionally wrong; body odor can be due to many factors, some beyond immediate control.
- Therefore, the author is at fault for how the situation was handled.",stop,305,161,466

**Reasoning:**  
The author admits to intentionally not allowing other cars to merge in front of them out of a sense of competitiveness and territoriality, even in situations where merging is a normal part of traffic flow (e.g., at the end of a lane or where two lanes become one). While ""cutting in line"" can be frustrating, safe and efficient merging is a necessary part of driving, and intentionally blocking others can create dangerous situations and increase road rage. The author recognizes that sometimes merging is necessary (e.g., from an on-ramp), but their general attitude and behavior toward merging is problematic and contributes to traffic issues.

You (the author) are not at fault for not wanting to have sex while you are very sick, pregnant, and exhausted. Consent is always required, and your boyfriend's repeated requests and physical advances after you have said no are inappropriate and disrespectful. While he is under stress and helping a lot, that does not entitle him to sex, especially when you are unwell and have clearly communicated your boundaries.

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author describes a long history of being targeted by their aunt with judgmental, dismissive, and offensive social media posts, especially regarding mental health and sexuality.
- The aunt repeatedly tags the author in memes that belittle their struggles and identity, despite knowing these are sensitive topics.
- The author finally responds with a long, direct message pointing out the hypocrisy and hurtful behavior, but does not use slurs or explicit insults.
- The aunt and her family escalate the situation by blocking the author, sending nasty messages, and publicly shaming the author on social media.
- The author’s response, while blunt and emotional, is a reaction to ongoing provocation and boundary violations.
- The aunt’s behavior is the root cause of the conflict, and the family’s reaction is disproportionate and hostile.

Therefore, the aunt (and by extension, the family members who joined in) are at fault for instigating and escalating the situation. The author’s response, while strong, is understandable given the context and does not rise to the same level of fault.

Step by step reasoning:
- The author is expressing feelings and reactions to a situation, not acting on them inappropriately.
- The friend is dressing as she chooses in her own living space, which is her right, especially if there are no agreed-upon house rules.
- The wife is not directly involved in the conflict, as described.
- There is a clash of comfort levels and expectations, but no one is described as acting maliciously or violating clear boundaries.
- The situation is about differing perspectives and comfort, not clear-cut fault.

**Reasoning:**
- The author (retail worker) followed store policy: the coupon is only valid with the rewards card, and the register/accounting system requires this for inventory and financial accuracy.
- The customer was frustrated, but she did not have the required card or cash, so she could not complete the transaction as intended.
- The author was polite and explained the situation, and did not have the authority to override the system or issue a coupon without cause.
- The customer’s frustration is understandable, but not the fault of the author, who was simply enforcing the rules set by the store and the coupon program.
- There is no evidence of malice, negligence, or wrongdoing by either party—just an unfortunate situation.

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Situation Summary**: The author is expressing frustration that her husband is willing to help friends quickly but is not following through on commitments at home, specifically hanging shelves that are important to her. There is also a history of the husband losing his temper and breaking something important, but he has since improved his temper.

2. **Fault Analysis**:
   - The author has communicated her needs and feelings to her husband.
   - The husband has acknowledged some understanding but has not acted on the specific request (hanging shelves), despite having time and willingness to help others.
   - The author attempted to do the task herself but was unable to complete it due to the size of the shelves.
   - The husband’s lack of follow-through on a promise, especially after a significant incident (breaking a wedding item), is the main source of the author’s hurt.

3. **Responsibility**:
   - The author is not at fault for feeling hurt or for communicating her needs.
   - The husband is at fault for not following through on a promise and for not prioritizing his partner’s needs at home, especially after a prior incident that required rebuilding trust.

4. **Conclusion**: The fault lies with the husband (Other), as he has not fulfilled a reasonable expectation in the relationship and has not matched his actions at home to his willingness to help others.

- The girlfriend wants to go, which is also a valid personal preference.
- The author is not forbidding or preventing the girlfriend from going; he is simply explaining his reasons for not wanting to attend.
- There is no indication of disrespect, coercion, or wrongdoing from either party—just a difference in opinion.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Both you and your girlfriend were in a bad mood from an earlier argument, which likely affected your emotional states and communication.
- She got frustrated when she couldn't orgasm and abruptly ended foreplay, which understandably left you feeling confused and rejected.
- Your reaction—accusing her of ""teasing"" you and expressing frustration—was also emotionally charged and not particularly empathetic.
- When she initiated sex again and admitted it was ""pity sex,"" you felt insulted and stopped, which is within your right, but the way the conversation unfolded escalated the tension.
- Both of you exchanged harsh words (""asshole,"" ""fuck this""), which contributed to the conflict.
- You both apologized in the morning, indicating recognition of shared responsibility.

- The author is expressing frustration and annoyance over their girlfriend not texting as much after work, despite her working long hours and being tired.
- The girlfriend is still making an effort to communicate, even if it's less frequent or less detailed than the author would like.
- The author escalates the situation by expressing anger, demanding a certain type of communication, and ultimately blocking her, rather than communicating calmly or giving her the space he claims to want.
- The girlfriend's responses, while perhaps not perfectly attuned to the author's emotional state, are not disrespectful or malicious.
- The author’s expectations for constant communication and immediate responses, especially given her work schedule and fatigue, are unreasonable and controlling.
- Blocking her over this is a disproportionate response and not a healthy way to handle relationship conflict.

- The author made a pact with another person (C) to hook up if either becomes single, and both acknowledged mutual attraction.
- Even though no physical cheating occurred, making such a pact can be seen as emotional infidelity or at least disrespectful to the current partner.
- The author’s best friend points out that this is a breach of trust and could be considered ""gatekeeping"" for future unfaithfulness.
- The author admits to not thinking much of it, but also asks if they are being an ""asshole,"" indicating some awareness of possible wrongdoing.
- C is also in a relationship, but the question is about the author’s responsibility.

- The author has set a boundary by asking him not to keep bringing it up if he won't try the suggested solution.
- Setting boundaries when feeling emotionally exhausted is reasonable and not inherently ""being an asshole.""

- Even though the author intended it as a joke and did not intend harm, impersonating a staff member and sending a fake email (especially in a stressful academic context) is inappropriate and can be distressing.
- The friend (Ani) was justified in feeling hurt and reporting the incident, as impersonation and misuse of university systems are serious matters.
- The university found the author at fault, though they decided not to take further action due to it being a first offense and not part of a pattern.
- The author’s remorse and lack of malicious intent are mitigating factors, but do not absolve responsibility for the action.

Final Answer: Other

Step by step reasoning:
- The author describes receiving poor service: only food was brought, had to ask for basics like water and soy sauce, and the staff were ""particularly rude.""
- The author tipped $2 on a $40 meal (5%), which is below the customary 15-20% in the US, but justified it based on the poor service.
- The waiter responded rudely, calling the author a ""lousy person"" and refusing the tip.
- The author asks if they are at fault (AITA).

Analysis:
- Tipping is generally expected for good service, but it is also customary to reduce the tip for poor service.
- The author’s actions (leaving a small tip due to poor service) are within social norms.
- The waiter’s reaction (rudeness, personal insults) is unprofessional and escalates the situation.

- The author’s reaction (being upset) is understandable but not unreasonable or harmful; they did not act out or mistreat anyone.
- The parents’ expectation that the author entertain the guest is typical in family settings, though it could have been communicated better.

   - The author is a woman who works in a small town store.
   - A regular customer persistently flirts and asks her out, despite her polite rejections.
   - The customer escalates to asking for a kiss and physically leans in, which the author rejects.
   - The author has tried to deflect his advances, even lying about her sexuality to get him to stop.
   - She is now considering being more direct or ""colder"" in her rejection.

2. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The customer is at fault for repeatedly making unwanted advances, ignoring polite rejections, and escalating to physical behavior (leaning in for a kiss without consent).
   - The author has not done anything wrong; she has tried to handle the situation politely and has a right to set boundaries.
   - Lying about her sexuality is not ideal, but it is a defensive response to persistent harassment, not an act of wrongdoing.
   - There is no indication that anyone else (e.g., management, coworkers) is at fault.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - The customer is at fault for making the author uncomfortable and not respecting her boundaries.
   - The author is not at fault for wanting to be more direct or ""colder"" in her rejection, especially after polite attempts have failed.

You (the author) are at fault here.

The fact that you are okay with your ex coming but not your current boyfriend, and that you frame it as ""these are my friends,"" is exclusionary and could be seen as prioritizing your ex and your friend group over your current relationship. Your boyfriend's desire to share an activity with you and get to know your friends is reasonable, especially since you didn't object to him going to his own event with his friends. 

While everyone needs time with their own friends, the way you handled this situation lacks empathy for your boyfriend's feelings and doesn't foster inclusion or trust in your relationship.

- The ex-partner (Jessica) is now seeking forgiveness, citing a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) as justification for her past actions, but has not actually apologized or taken responsibility.
- The author is being pressured by Jessica, her friends, and her mother to forgive, with the rationale that her mental health condition excuses her behavior.
- The author is questioning whether refusing to forgive is wrong.

Analysis:
- Abuse, regardless of the abuser's mental health status, is not excusable. While BPD can contribute to emotional dysregulation, it does not absolve someone of responsibility for abusive actions, especially when there is no genuine apology or effort to make amends.
- The author is not at fault for refusing to forgive or re-engage with an abuser, especially in the absence of a sincere apology or demonstrated change.
- The fault lies with Jessica for her abusive behavior, and with those pressuring the author to forgive without accountability or apology.

Therefore, the author is not at fault; the fault lies with others (Jessica and those pressuring the author).",stop,1540,262,1802

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Nature of the Behavior**: The author and their friends are approaching strangers under the pretense of genuine interest, but their real motivation is to play a game and boost their own confidence, not to form real connections.

2. **Potential Harm**: The people being approached are not aware of the true intent and may feel objectified, misled, or uncomfortable. This can be emotionally manipulative, especially since the author admits they rarely follow up, making the interaction disingenuous.

3. **Consent and Respect**: While the author claims nothing is forceful, the act of approaching strangers for a ""game"" without their knowledge or consent can cross boundaries and make others feel like objects or ""tools"" for someone else's amusement.

4. **Responsibility**: The author is aware of the potential harm (""this is kinda borderline sexual harassment,"" ""we're basically using people as ways for us to feel better"") and continues the behavior. This self-awareness increases their responsibility for the negative impact.

5. **Others' Involvement**: While the friends are also participating, the question is about the author's responsibility in the situation as described.

Given these points, the author is at fault for knowingly engaging in behavior that uses others for personal gain and may cause discomfort or harm, even if unintentionally.",stop,376,283,659

Step by step reasoning:
- The author is expressing frustration about being told not to get a dog, but is not actually harming anyone or any animal yet.
- The author is considering the needs of the dog (parents-in-law have a garden, SO can work from home, etc.).
- The people advising against getting a dog are expressing their opinions, possibly out of concern, but are not at fault for simply giving advice.
- No dog has been acquired yet, so no harm has occurred.
- The author is not being selfish just for wanting a dog, especially if they are planning for the dog's welfare.
- There is no clear wrongdoing or harm in the situation as described.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is describing a situation where their partner offers a sexual act but is visibly uncomfortable or disgusted by certain aspects of it.
- The author, in turn, feels anxious and unable to enjoy the act, leading them to decline the offer, which then upsets their partner.
- The author is not at fault for their feelings or for declining something that makes them uncomfortable or anxious.
- The partner is not at fault for having a phobia or discomfort, nor for feeling a bit rejected, as these are natural emotional responses.
- There is no evidence of malice, manipulation, or intentional harm from either party.
- This is a situation of mismatched comfort levels and communication, not wrongdoing.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**

Step by step:

1. **Initial Unprotected Sex:**  
   The author acknowledges that having unprotected sex with someone they just met was a mistake. However, both parties were adults, consented, and the author took responsibility the next morning by getting a morning-after pill and discussing the situation.

2. **Subsequent Encounters:**  
   The author was clear about not wanting a relationship, and the woman agreed. They used protection in all subsequent encounters.

3. **Breakup:**  
   The author communicated their intentions and ended things respectfully. The woman's strong emotional reaction is unfortunate, but the author cannot control her feelings or mental health.

4. **Pregnancy/Miscarriage Claim:**  
   The author responded with empathy and support, even though there was some uncertainty about the claim's legitimacy.

5. **Aftermath:**  
   The author continued to respond with empathy, provided resources for mental health support, and maintained boundaries.

**Conclusion:**  
While the author made a mistake by having unprotected sex, they took responsible steps afterward. Both parties were adults making their own choices. The emotional fallout is unfortunate, but not the result of malice or neglect. There is no clear ""fault"" in the sense of wrongdoing beyond the initial lapse in judgment, which the author already acknowledges and regrets. The situation is complex and sad, but not one where blame can be squarely placed on any one person.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**
Step by step:

1. **Situation Overview:** The author describes a history of emotional neglect, controlling behavior, and lack of appropriate support from their parents, especially regarding mental health and identity. The parents' actions (or inactions) are described as major contributors to the author's mental health struggles, including a suicide attempt.

2. **Author's Actions:** The author is considering cutting off contact with their parents for their own well-being, after years of distress and after consulting with a counselor who supports this decision if it is what the author wants.

3. **Fault Assessment:** The question is whether the author would be ""the asshole"" (i.e., at fault) for cutting off their parents. The author is not at fault for seeking to protect their own mental health, especially after years of harm and after attempting to process the situation with professional help.

4. **Parents' Responsibility:** The parents, while having their own trauma (loss of a child), failed to provide a supportive, healthy environment and did not appropriately address the author's mental health needs. Their controlling and dismissive behaviors, as described, are the root cause of the author's distress.

5. **Other Parties:** The family doctor may have also failed in their duty of care, but the primary focus is on the parents' long-term impact.

6. **Conclusion:** The parents are at fault for the situation described. The author is not at fault for wanting to cut contact for their own health and safety.

- The author is considering keeping the relationship going with the girl, despite knowing he does not see her as a long-term partner and is interested in pursuing other girls.
- He acknowledges that he might cheat if he continues, and is only staying because he doesn't want to hurt her, not because he genuinely wants to be with her.
- This is unfair to the girl, as she is emotionally invested and believes the relationship is genuine.
- The ethical course of action would be to be honest with her about his feelings and intentions, even if it causes short-term pain, rather than stringing her along or risking cheating.

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author initiated teasing and provoked M, including making a personal comment about M's sexuality, which is inappropriate and could be considered bullying.
- M responded physically (flicking, gripping neck, pushing on chair), which is not an appropriate response and could be considered physical aggression.
- M escalated further by writing a deeply hurtful and homophobic message, which is a serious verbal attack.
- The author then retaliated with a personal comment about M's girlfriend, knowing it would upset him.
- Both parties continued to escalate the situation with personal attacks.
- The teacher intervened and had both apologize, indicating both were at fault.

Both the author and M engaged in inappropriate, hurtful behavior and escalated the conflict. Therefore, everyone involved in the conflict (the author and M) shares responsibility.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The author admits to ""snooping"" on their partner—specifically, looking up her LoL (League of Legends) account and match history to check her activity, motivated by trust issues and suspicion.
2. The author had previously engaged in similar behavior, which had already caused a fight and a breakup, but they got back together and agreed to work on things.
3. The partner had a stated boundary about social media, which the author respected outwardly but still felt suspicious about.
4. The author confronted their partner with the information they found through snooping, which led to a major argument and the end of the relationship.
5. The author is asking if they are at fault for snooping and bringing it up.

Analysis:
- Snooping on a partner's private accounts or activity without their consent is generally considered a breach of trust and privacy, regardless of the suspicions or motivations.
- The author had a history of trust issues and had already discussed this with their partner, who was upset by it previously.
- The partner's reaction, while strong, was in response to a repeated violation of trust.
- There is no evidence in the situation that the partner did anything wrong (even if she was playing games while sick, that is not inherently deceptive or malicious).

Therefore, the author is at fault for violating their partner's privacy and trust, especially after a previous incident and discussion about this very issue.",stop,1114,304,1418

Final Answer: Author

Step by step reasoning:  
- The author describes a habit of piling up trash (""trash mountains"") and not flattening boxes, which makes it harder for someone else (her husband) to take out the trash.
- The husband has communicated that this makes the task more difficult and has asked for a change in behavior.
- The author acknowledges that the requests are reasonable and that her actions are due to being busy, not maliciousness.
- However, the question is about fault (""AITA?""), which in this context means: Is the author at fault for making things harder for her husband by not managing the trash in a more considerate way?
- While being busy is understandable, the author is still responsible for her own actions and their impact on others in a shared living space.
- The husband is not at fault for asking for reasonable consideration.
- Therefore, the author is at fault, though not in a malicious or egregious way—just in a minor, everyday inconsiderate way that can be easily remedied.

Final Answer: Nobody

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author and their twin sister usually wish each other happy birthday.
   - This year, the author made a Facebook post with a collage for their sister, but the sister did not text or message the author directly.
   - The author noticed this a week later and texted the sister late at night, asking why she hadn’t wished them a happy birthday.
   - The sister responded defensively, saying the author was making an issue out of nothing and that it was unfair to bring it up a week later.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - The author did make an effort to wish their sister a happy birthday, but did so via Facebook, not text.
   - The sister did not reciprocate, but may have seen the Facebook post as sufficient or may have missed it.
   - The author waited a week and then brought it up late at night, which could be seen as poor timing, but not malicious.
   - The sister’s response was defensive, but not overtly cruel.

3. **Intent and Harm:**  
   - There is no evidence of malice or intentional harm from either party.
   - The author was hurt and expressed their feelings, albeit late and perhaps awkwardly.
   - The sister was dismissive, but not abusive.

4. **Social Norms:**  
   - Forgetting to wish someone a happy birthday, especially a twin, can be hurtful, but is a common oversight.
   - Bringing up hurt feelings is not inherently wrong, though timing and tone matter.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - This is a minor miscommunication and a case of hurt feelings, not a situation where someone is clearly at fault.
   - Both parties could have handled things better, but neither is truly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense.

Even though the author paid for the meal, it was her food, and eating someone else's leftovers without permission is generally considered inconsiderate, especially after a first date.

Final Answer: Info

Step by step reasoning:

1. The situation involves a potential ethical dilemma: whether the author (you) would be ""the asshole"" (at fault) for telling C (your sister) that D (your brother-in-law) is smoking weed and possibly planning to cheat a drug test, which could put M's (C's husband) job and reputation at risk.

2. The core question is about fault: Is anyone at fault yet, or is this a hypothetical about what would happen if you told C?

3. D is at risk of being at fault for smoking weed when he knows he needs to pass a drug test for a job recommendation that could impact someone else's career. He may also be at fault for potentially planning to cheat the test.

4. M is not at fault; he is offering help with a reasonable condition.

5. The author is not at fault yet; they are only considering whether to inform C.

6. The question is ""WIBTA if I tell C about this?""—so the author is asking if they would be at fault for telling C.

7. To determine fault, more information is needed:
   - Is D definitely planning to cheat the test, or is the kit just there?
   - Would telling C actually help, or would it just cause drama?
   - Is there a better way to handle the situation (e.g., talking to D directly)?

8. The situation is complex and depends on motivations, relationships, and possible outcomes.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Food Habits and Money**: The author is not at fault for being upset about the roommates' changing food habits or the overestimation of food. People's preferences change, and misjudging portions is a common mistake. This is a shared miscommunication and not a moral failing.

2. **Blood in the Food**: The critical issue is that the author knowingly served food that had blood in it (from Aaron's cut) to guests, without informing them or discarding the contaminated portion. This is a clear breach of food safety and social trust. Even if Aaron was acting erratically, the author had agency and responsibility as the cook and host.

3. **Responsibility**: While Aaron is at fault for being careless and unsanitary, the author had the final say in whether to serve the food. The author recognized the contamination, felt disgusted, but still served it to 12 people, which is a significant lapse in judgment.

4. **Conclusion**: The author is at fault for serving contaminated food to guests, regardless of the circumstances leading up to it. The other issues (food habits, money) are minor compared to this.

2. **Power Dynamics:** Offering money to a friend in a financially vulnerable position for a sexual act introduces a problematic power dynamic and could be seen as coercive, even if unintentionally.
3. **Friend's Boundaries:** The friend has been supportive and nonchalant about the author's feelings, but there is no indication that he is interested in a sexual relationship. Pushing the issue, especially with a financial incentive, risks disrespecting his boundaries.
4. **Potential Harm:** The author recognizes that this could ""potentially worsen our friendship,"" indicating awareness that the request could be inappropriate or damaging.
5. **Intent vs. Impact:** While the author may not intend harm, the impact of such a request could be significant, making the author at fault for crossing a line.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Overview:**  
   - The author feels hurt and excluded by a long-time friend who has become distant and unresponsive.
   - The friend stopped engaging in group chats, unfollowed the author on Instagram, and did not acknowledge gifts or messages.
   - The author eventually reciprocated the distance by unfollowing and leaving the group chat.
   - The friend later sent a parcel with gifts and a thank you card, but the author feels it’s too late.

2. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - **Author:** The author’s actions (unfollowing, leaving the chat) were reactive to feeling ignored and hurt. They did not act maliciously or escalate the situation.
   - **Friend:** The friend’s withdrawal is unexplained. While it’s hurtful, people sometimes pull away for personal reasons (mental health, life changes, etc.). There’s no evidence of malice or intent to harm.
   - **Mutual Friend:** The mutual friend tried to de-escalate and did not take sides.
   - **Everybody/Nobody:** This is a case of miscommunication, unmet expectations, and possibly personal struggles. There is no clear wrongdoing, just a breakdown in the friendship.

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - No one is clearly at fault. The situation is sad and frustrating, but it’s not about someone being an “asshole.” It’s about drifting apart, possibly due to unspoken issues or personal circumstances.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Situation Summary**: The author has lost romantic feelings for their girlfriend for about a year but stayed in the relationship because her relative was very ill, and then passed away. The author feels their lack of affection may have hurt her more than helped, and is now wondering if they are at fault for staying, and if breaking up now would make them the ""bad guy.""

2. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The girlfriend is not at fault; she is unaware of the author's true feelings and is dealing with a family tragedy.
   - The author is aware of their lack of feelings and has chosen to stay, not out of love, but out of a sense of obligation or fear of hurting her during a difficult time.
   - The author admits their behavior (lack of affection, forced interactions) may have caused more harm than good, as the girlfriend likely senses something is wrong.

3. **Ethical Considerations**:  
   - While the author's intentions (not wanting to hurt her during a crisis) are understandable, staying in a relationship without genuine feelings, especially for an extended period, is generally considered unfair to the other person.
   - Prolonging the relationship can lead to more pain and confusion for the girlfriend, who may sense the emotional distance but not know the reason.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - The author is at fault for not being honest sooner. While the timing was difficult, continuing a relationship without love is not a kindness in the long run.
   - The author would not be at fault for breaking up now; in fact, ending things honestly is the right thing to do.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Your feelings are valid:** It's normal to feel hurt, confused, or even angry when someone you care about doesn't reciprocate your feelings, especially after a close friendship and what felt like ""couple-like"" behavior. Emotions are not inherently wrong or blameworthy.

2. **Her actions are understandable:** She may have realized that the closeness was being interpreted as romantic, which made her uncomfortable, especially if she didn't feel the same way. It's reasonable for her to want space to avoid leading you on or to process her own feelings.

3. **No one is at fault for feelings:** You are not at fault for being upset, and she is not at fault for not reciprocating your feelings or for needing space. Both of you are navigating a difficult and emotionally charged situation as best you can.

4. **Communication breakdowns happen:** Misunderstandings and awkwardness are common after one person expresses romantic interest and the other doesn't feel the same way. This doesn't make either party ""at fault""—it's a natural, if painful, part of human relationships.

5. **No malicious intent:** There is no evidence of anyone acting with malice or intentionally hurting the other. Both parties are reacting to a tough situation.

Therefore, while the situation is painful and frustrating, nobody is truly ""at fault"" here. It's just an unfortunate outcome of mismatched feelings and expectations.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Background:** M was offered a place to stay by the author and their suitemate, under the condition that she not get back together with her ex-boyfriend, as the original reason for her needing a place was to get away from him.

2. **Repeated Behavior:** M repeatedly broke this agreement, lied about her whereabouts, and continued to see her ex-boyfriend, despite clear communication from the author and suitemate about the boundaries.

3. **Confrontation:** The author and suitemate confronted M after multiple instances of dishonesty and boundary-crossing, and asked her to move out, as per the original agreement.

4. **Social Feedback:** Some people told the author they should have handled it differently and were ""bitches"" for how they confronted M.

**Fault Analysis:**
- The author and suitemate provided free housing with a clear, reasonable boundary.
- M repeatedly broke the agreement and was dishonest.
- The confrontation, while perhaps blunt, was a direct response to repeated boundary violations.

**Conclusion:**  
The author and suitemate are not at fault for setting a boundary in their own home, especially when providing free housing. M is responsible for her own choices and for breaking the agreement.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- You asked your friend if she would be willing to share the referral bonus since you are the reason she would get it.
- She declined, saying she wants to keep the points for herself.
- You expressed your opinion that it would be fair to share, but you did not demand or insist beyond asking.
- Asking for a share of the bonus is not inherently wrong or rude; it’s a reasonable question.
- Your friend is also not at fault for declining, as the referral program is designed to reward the referrer.
- No one acted maliciously or unfairly; it’s a matter of personal preference and boundaries.

**Reasoning:**  
- The author had a strong phobia and reacted accordingly, but did not cause a public scene or damage property.
- The staff could have been more empathetic, but roaches are common in Japan, especially in summer, and it was late at night.
- The staff did offer to refund the night and told the author they could leave if unhappy, which is a reasonable solution.
- The author did not leave a bad review or escalate the situation.
- Both parties acted within reasonable bounds given the circumstances, though communication was strained.

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author ordered a $15 meal, while others ordered more expensive items (including drinks).
- The group decided to split the bill evenly, but the author was not aware of this decision and did not participate in the conversation.
- When the author noticed their share was double what they ordered, they spoke up, but the group insisted on the even split and did not accommodate the author's reasonable concern.
- The author is under financial stress and did not want to be petty, but was still upset by the situation.

Fault analysis:
- The author is not at fault for being unaware of the split and for objecting when they noticed the discrepancy.
- The group (the ""other"" people) are at fault for not communicating the split decision clearly and for not being considerate when the author raised a valid concern, especially given the significant difference in what was ordered and the author's financial situation.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author watched porn and saved some pictures, then deleted them from the phone but forgot about cloud backup. This is a common technological oversight, not malicious intent.
- The girlfriend found the pictures accidentally while looking for photos of them as a couple. She was upset, which is a valid emotional response, but she did not find evidence of cheating or direct betrayal.
- The author did not cheat or break any explicit relationship rules (based on the information given). Watching porn is a personal activity and, unless previously discussed as a boundary, is not inherently a breach of trust.
- The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but not necessarily ""at fault""—she is entitled to her feelings, even if the author feels she is overreacting.
- There is no evidence of intentional wrongdoing, deception, or harm by either party.

- The coworker is being reimbursed by the company for mileage, which covers gas and wear/tear.

- In business travel, when the driver is reimbursed by the company, it is standard that passengers do not owe the driver additional money.

Final Answer: Info

Step by step reasoning:
- The author is expressing frustration about shared use of a common space (the kitchen) for activities other than cooking/eating, such as meetings and calls.
- The author feels entitled to use the kitchen for its intended purpose without worrying about disrupting others.
- The other party (presumably a housemate or family member) is using the kitchen for work, meetings, and calls, despite other available spaces.
- The author is considering intentionally disrupting these activities to make a point.

To determine fault, we need to know:
- What agreements or house rules exist about shared spaces?
- Have the parties communicated about this issue and tried to compromise?
- Is there a reason the other person must use the kitchen (e.g., better internet, lack of privacy elsewhere)?
- Is the author actually disrupting calls, or just thinking about it?

Without this context, it's hard to assign fault definitively. Both parties have reasonable needs, but the situation hinges on communication and shared expectations.

The author’s repeated ""No one cares"" comments are insensitive, but the friend’s behavior could also be seen as excessive. However, the author is specifically asking about their own actions in response to the friend's behavior.

Step by step:
- The friend is enthusiastic, possibly to an annoying degree, but not malicious.
- The author responds in a way that is likely to hurt the friend's feelings.
- The conflict arises from the author's dismissive comments, not just the friend's enthusiasm.

Given this, the author’s response is unnecessarily harsh, and that is what is causing the friend to be upset. The friend’s behavior may be annoying, but it is not inherently wrong or hurtful.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Author's Actions:** The author overheard two people being cruel about a third (A) and decided to inform A about it, possibly loudly and in a way that caused her distress. The author did not embellish or fabricate, but relayed what was said.

2. **The Other Girls' Actions:** The two girls were being mean-spirited, talking behind A's back, and even joked about (or possibly actually) tampering with her food. This is clearly unkind and potentially harmful behavior.

3. **A's Actions:** A was not at fault; she was the victim in this scenario.

4. **Fault Analysis:**
   - The two girls are at fault for being mean and possibly threatening (or actually) to tamper with A's food.
   - The author intervened, which some might see as meddling, but did so out of a sense of justice and empathy. While the delivery may have been blunt or disruptive, the intent was to protect A from harm and dishonesty.
   - The author did not escalate the situation beyond informing A; there was no physical confrontation or further drama instigated by the author.

5. **Ethical Considerations:** While some might argue the author should have ""minded their own business,"" most would agree that alerting someone to potential harm (especially food tampering) is justified. The author could have been more discreet, but the core action was not malicious.

6. **Conclusion:** The primary fault lies with the two girls, but the question is ""AITA?"" (Am I the Asshole?), i.e., is the author at fault? Given the context, the author acted out of concern and did not create the original problem. Therefore, the author is **not** at fault.

The author is also self-aware and concerned about not burdening their mother, which shows care and respect.

- The boyfriend is now upset, but there is no evidence of infidelity or deception on the author's part.
- The boyfriend's own behavior (lying about job, staying with friends who proposition him) may contribute to mutual suspicion, but does not directly make the author at fault.
- The situation seems to be about boundaries and trust, not about clear wrongdoing.

- The author is only expressing annoyance, not acting out or blaming unfairly.
- The mom's actions (taking unprescribed drugs) are the root cause of the illness and subsequent situation.

- The event is significant for the children (a rare family reunion and Disneyland trip), and the refusal is causing them distress.
- The author’s justification is based on principle and past precedent, not on the best interests or happiness of the children.
- While the ex could have communicated better and not painted the author as the villain, the core issue is the author’s inflexibility, which is directly causing the children’s unhappiness.
- The best interests of the children should take precedence over rigid adherence to the schedule, especially for special occasions.

**Reasoning:**

- **Author:** The author is at fault for losing their temper and expressing their frustration in a harsh, disrespectful way about people who are important to their wife. While their feelings are understandable, the way they communicated them was insensitive and escalated the situation.
- **Wife:** The wife is at fault for not communicating the full expectations of the honeymoon in advance, and for not being understanding of her husband's discomfort during a clearly unpleasant visit. She also escalated the situation by leaving abruptly and cutting off communication.
- **Wife's Parents:** They are somewhat at fault for attaching unspoken conditions to their gift and not making those expectations clear to both parties.
- **The ""Friends"":** While their behavior was unpleasant, they are not really at fault in the context of the marriage conflict.

**Summary:** Both the author and his wife contributed to the conflict through poor communication and emotional escalation. The situation could have been avoided or de-escalated with better communication and empathy on both sides. Thus, ""Everybody"" is the most accurate answer.",stop,763,228,991

- The author is not acting out of malice, but out of uncertainty and concern for family dynamics.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The uncle was wrong to physically hit (slap) the author over a relatively minor disagreement. Physical violence is not an appropriate response to frustration, especially with a family member.
2. The author was wrong to escalate the situation by punching the uncle in the stomach and shouting insults. Physical retaliation and verbal abuse are also inappropriate.
3. The uncle's later comments about the author's mental health were insensitive and dismissive, though he did apologize for hitting.
4. The author admits to being ""lazy"" and not contributing much, but also explains that this is due to depression and mental health struggles, which complicates the issue. However, not immediately helping with a small request (buying ketchup) is not a major fault, especially given the context.
5. The grandmother and mother seem to be minimizing the uncle's physical aggression and focusing on obedience, which is not a balanced view.
6. Both parties could have handled the situation with more patience and understanding, and both escalated the conflict unnecessarily.

Given all of this, fault is shared among the author, the uncle, and to some extent the other family members for their responses. Therefore, ""Everybody"" is the most accurate answer.",stop,906,257,1163

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Author's actions:** The author withdrew from the roommate, spent less time together, and did not communicate about the new boyfriend or the reasons for being less available. The author also admits to ""digging their heels in"" and refusing to initiate a conversation, even after learning the roommate was upset.

2. **Roommate's actions:** The roommate did not directly communicate her feelings to the author, instead choosing to complain to mutual friends and act passive-aggressively (e.g., not cleaning, restricting groceries, closing doors, etc.). She escalated the situation by venting to others and not addressing the issue head-on.

3. **Communication breakdown:** Both parties failed to communicate openly. The author avoided confrontation, and the roommate chose indirect methods to express her frustration.

4. **External factors:** The author was dealing with personal issues (breakup, death of a friend, family problems), which understandably affected her capacity to handle roommate drama. However, this does not absolve her from all responsibility in the breakdown.

5. **Conclusion:** Both the author and the roommate contributed to the deterioration of their relationship through poor communication and avoidance. Neither party is solely at fault; both share responsibility.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author dated someone, broke up, and months later learned she is pregnant with his child.
   - The author never wanted children and was clear about this.
   - The ex wants to keep the baby; paternity is confirmed.
   - The author wants to ""opt out"" of all parental responsibility, including financial support (""financial abortion"").
   - The ex and her friends are upset at the author's refusal to acknowledge or support the child.

2. **Moral and Legal Considerations:**  
   - **Legally:** In most jurisdictions, both biological parents are responsible for supporting their child, regardless of intent or desire. There is no legal mechanism for a ""financial abortion"" in the way the author describes.
   - **Morally:** While the author was clear about not wanting children, both parties engaged in consensual sex, knowing that contraception is not 100% effective. The author is now the biological parent of a child who will exist and have needs, regardless of his wishes.
   - The mother cannot force the author to be emotionally involved, but the child is an innocent party who did not choose the circumstances of their conception.

3. **Fault Assessment:**  
   - The author is at fault for wanting to completely abdicate responsibility for a child he helped create. While he is not at fault for the pregnancy itself (assuming contraceptive failure), he is at fault for refusing to accept any responsibility for the consequences of his actions.
   - The mother is not at fault for choosing to keep the child; that is her right.
   - The friends' reactions, while perhaps harsh, are understandable given the situation.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The author is at fault for wanting to ""opt out"" of all responsibility for his child. While his feelings are understandable, his actions are not morally or legally justified.

Step by step reasoning:
- The author was asked to be a bridesmaid by a friend she hadn't spoken to in years, and accepted, rekindling the friendship.
- After the wedding, the friend stopped communicating, with no fight or clear reason.
- The author planned her own wedding, chose bridesmaids from her closest friends and family, and posted about it on social media.
- The former friend was upset (as seen in a screenshot) that she wasn't told directly she wouldn't be a bridesmaid.
- There was no explicit promise or expectation set that the author would reciprocate the bridesmaid invitation.
- The friendship had faded again after the friend's wedding, with no communication for months.
- The author did not intentionally exclude or insult the friend, nor did she owe her a bridesmaid spot or a special message.

Given these facts, there is no clear wrongdoing or malice from either party. The situation is more about mismatched expectations and drifting friendships than fault. The friend may feel hurt, but the author is not at fault for her choices or for not reaching out specifically.

- The author is within their rights to feel disappointed and to decline the ""do-over"" party, as personal boundaries and feelings are valid.
- The brother is also making an effort to make amends, which is a positive action.
- There is no clear malicious intent or egregious wrongdoing on either side; it's a matter of differing expectations and values about family obligations and ""do-overs.""
- This is a situation where feelings are hurt, but no one is objectively ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense.

- The author is offering to use their points for a free, nice hotel, which is generous and reasonable.
- The girlfriend wants to stay at the designated hotel to be with the wedding party, which is also reasonable given the social context of weddings.
- Both perspectives are understandable: the author is trying to save money and use their resources, while the girlfriend wants to maximize her experience at her best friend's wedding.

- While the friend's conversational style may be repetitive or not engaging for the author, the author’s response is unnecessarily harsh and dismissive.
- The author could have communicated their feelings more tactfully or redirected the conversation without invalidating the friend's enthusiasm.

- The author is frustrated by repeated last-minute cancellations and lack of communication, which is understandable.
- The girl has a demanding, irregular job and has provided work-related reasons for bailing, but has not communicated well or apologized for repeated cancellations.
- The author is considering not responding to her latest message as a way to end things, which some might see as ""ghosting.""
- The friend thinks not texting back is a ""dick move,"" but the author feels justified given the pattern of behavior.
- There is no clear malicious intent or egregious wrongdoing from either party; rather, it's a case of mismatched expectations and poor communication.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is feeling disappointed that their friend got them a different game than the one they were hinting at, but has not expressed this disappointment to the friend.
- The friend bought a gift in good faith, likely wanting to reciprocate kindness and share something they thought the author would enjoy.
- The author is questioning whether their internal feeling of disappointment makes them an ""asshole"" (at fault).
- Feeling disappointed about a gift, especially when you had a preference, is a normal human emotion and not a moral failing.
- The author has not acted on this disappointment in a way that would hurt the friend (e.g., complaining, being ungrateful).
- The friend is not at fault for not picking up on hints or for choosing a different game; gift-giving is subjective and based on personal judgment.
- There is no evidence of malice, neglect, or unreasonable behavior from either party.

**Reasoning:**  
The author is at fault here. While casual hookups are fine if both parties are on the same page, the author noticed clear signs that Cindy was inexperienced, insecure, and possibly emotionally attached. Despite this, the author proceeded with the hookup and then ""ghosted"" her, ignoring her messages and feelings. The author also admits to not communicating intentions clearly and dismisses Cindy's feelings as unimportant. This lack of communication and disregard for the other person's emotional state is inconsiderate and irresponsible, especially given the power imbalance and Cindy's inexperience.

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**  
Based on your description, you (the author) have communicated your needs and expectations clearly and reasonably: you asked your husband to spend time with you, with or without the kids, after he had already spent a significant portion of the day watching streams and doing other activities. Your husband, however, prioritized watching the streams over spending time with you, and even attempted to negotiate more in-app purchases (despite a previous agreement not to spend more money on the game) in exchange for his attention. 

Your feelings of disappointment and sadness are valid and understandable given the circumstances. Wanting to spend time with your partner, especially after handling household tasks and preparing dinner, is not an unrealistic expectation. The husband's behavior—prioritizing a stream and potential cash giveaways over quality time, and leveraging the situation for more game spending—suggests a lack of consideration for your feelings and prior agreements.

Therefore, you are **not** at fault for being upset or for your expectations. The fault lies with your husband for not balancing his interests with your needs and for reneging on a previous agreement about spending.",stop,469,236,705

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
- The author discovered something deeply unsettling (incest porn and activity in related subreddits) on her fiancé’s computer.
- She confronted him directly and is now feeling disturbed, especially as a mother of two young girls.
- She has not accused him of any crime or acted on anything but her own feelings of discomfort and protectiveness.
- The fiancé was embarrassed and denied being ""into it personally,"" but there is no evidence of actual harm or illegal activity.
- The author is not against porn in general, but is specifically disturbed by the nature of this content.
- Her reaction (not letting him change diapers or be alone with the kids) is protective, but not based on any evidence of actual risk—just her emotional response to what she found.
- She is asking if she is at fault for calling him out and being unable to deal with it.

**Conclusion:**  
Nobody is objectively ""at fault"" here. The author is reacting to a discovery that understandably makes her uncomfortable, especially as a parent. The fiancé’s porn preferences are disturbing to her, but there is no evidence of actual harm or intent to harm.

- There is no indication of misuse or negligence by the author.

The main issue here is that Harriet, the cousin, was pushy about her dish and disregarded the children's polite refusals, even after knowing about the youngest child's needs (being on the spectrum). The author and her husband have a reasonable family policy of not making food a battleground, and the children were polite in their refusals. The author could perhaps have been more diplomatic, but the primary fault lies with Harriet for not respecting boundaries and for being insistent, especially with a child who has known sensitivities. The MIL's suggestion is more about social niceties, but it is not a requirement to force children to eat or try food, especially when boundaries have been clearly communicated.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author has been generous in the past, driving her friend everywhere and not asking for gas money.
- The friend has started to rely on the author for last-minute rides due to her own poor planning (leaving late for the bus).
- On the author's day off, the friend uses a passive-aggressive tone to try to guilt the author into giving her a ride.
- The author chooses not to offer a ride, which is within her rights, especially since the friend’s predicament is due to her own actions.
- The friend is not entitled to a ride, and the author is not obligated to provide one, especially when it’s being taken for granted.
- There is no clear wrongdoing; the author is setting a boundary, and the friend is facing the natural consequence of her own choices.

Therefore, nobody is truly at fault in this situation. The author is not obligated to always help, and the friend is not wrong for being disappointed, but her expectation is unreasonable.",stop,466,214,680

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the information provided, the author was banned from r/legaladvice and r/bestoflegaladvice after using curse words and calling a moderator ""an absolute jerk"" in messages questioning a moderation decision. While the author feels the moderation was unfair and possibly abusive, the use of profanity and personal insults toward moderators is a clear violation of most subreddit rules and Reddit's content policy regarding civility and harassment. Moderators have the right to enforce rules and maintain order, and responding with hostility or insults—even if you disagree with their decision—typically results in bans.

The author admits to using curse words and making personal attacks, which are generally not acceptable in most online communities, especially when directed at moderators. While the moderation decision itself (locking a post for not having a question mark) may be debatable, the author's reaction and language are what led to the ban.

- The girlfriend continues to initiate physical affection (kissing, etc.) even after the author expresses a lack of interest or says no.
- The author communicates their discomfort and asks for space, but the girlfriend becomes upset.
- The core issue is the girlfriend not respecting the author's stated boundaries and using affection in a way that feels manipulative to the author.
- There is no indication that the author is at fault for expressing their needs and boundaries.

- **The Author** is at fault for escalating the situation into an ""epic"" text fight and for not communicating expectations clearly before agreeing to go to Mitch's place. The author also could have clarified the cab situation before hailing it, especially since there was hesitation about going in the first place.
- **Rob** and **Caleb** are less at fault, but Rob did not express any disagreement with Mitch's request, and Caleb was passive, so their roles are minor but present in the group dynamic.
- **Overall**, this is a classic case of mismatched expectations and poor communication among friends, with both sides feeling justified and neither side being completely unreasonable. The situation could have been avoided with clearer communication about hosting norms and cab fare before the night began.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Context:** The author and his girlfriend have been together for 1.5 years. She has been financially independent but became more frugal after a medical accident and resulting debt. She explicitly told the author she didn't want to discuss her finances or accept help.

2. **The Incident:** At brunch, the girlfriend didn't order food, likely due to financial stress, and was annoyed at having to split the bill. Afterward, she asked the author for $2 for a tamale, explaining she was hungry and didn't have cash or enough in her account.

3. **Author's Response:** The author refused to give her $2, told her to go to the bank, and then snapped at her for not ordering at brunch. When she explained her situation, he doubted her claim of food insecurity and accused her of guilt-tripping and mooching.

4. **Fault Analysis:**
   - The girlfriend did not communicate her financial struggles until this point, but she had previously set a boundary about not discussing her medical debt.
   - The author, upon learning she was hungry and struggling, responded with skepticism and a lack of empathy, despite being in a much better financial position and having the means to help.
   - The author’s reaction was dismissive and unsupportive, especially given the context of her recent hardship and the small amount of money involved.

5. **Conclusion:** While communication could have been better on both sides, the author is primarily at fault for his lack of empathy, his dismissive attitude, and his unwillingness to help his partner in a moment of need, especially given the power imbalance in their financial situations. The girlfriend’s request was reasonable under the circumstances, and the author’s response was unnecessarily harsh.

- The wife is managing alone and using a method that works for her, and she directly asks for less judgment.
- The author’s approach lacks empathy for the increased burden on the wife and frames the situation in a way that centers their own discomfort rather than supporting their partner.
- While the wife’s method may not be ideal long-term, the author’s response is unnecessarily critical given the circumstances.

   - The author demanded an apology from the boyfriend.
   - The sister cut off contact with the author.

2. **Who is at fault?**  
   - The author disclosed deeply personal and traumatic information about their sister without her permission. This is a violation of her privacy and agency.
   - The boyfriend's angry reaction is understandable given the context—he was put in a difficult and emotional situation by the author.
   - The sister's response is also understandable, as her trust and privacy were violated.

- The father may have made mistakes in the past (leaving when the author was a baby), but the situation's details are unclear, and he is now reaching out, possibly to make amends.
- The mother is not described as having done anything wrong in this scenario.
- There is no evidence of malice or wrongdoing in the present moment—just a difficult, emotionally charged situation.
- The author is not obligated to forgive or reconnect, nor are they ""an ass"" for feeling hesitant.

**Reasoning:**  
Based on the situation, the author has clearly communicated their boundaries and preferences regarding social media use, which is a personal choice. The partner is upset and feels that being ""claimed"" on Facebook is important, possibly due to her own insecurities or social expectations, and her friend is encouraging her to end the relationship over this issue. However, there is no clear wrongdoing or malice from any party—this is a difference in values and expectations about social media and relationships. The author is not hiding anything and is open about their life with their partner in real life, just not online. The partner and her friend may be overreacting, but that does not constitute fault in a moral or ethical sense; it's a mismatch in priorities.

- The author decided to publicly confront and shame the BIL on social media, essentially saying he shouldn't have an opinion because he doesn't contribute to society.
- The family is now upset with the author, and the sister is not speaking to them.

Analysis:
- The BIL's life choices may be frustrating, but everyone is entitled to their own opinions and free speech, regardless of employment or tax status.
- Publicly shaming or attacking someone for their views, especially in a personal and derogatory way, is generally considered inappropriate and unkind.
- The author escalated the situation by making it personal and public, which is why the family is upset.

2. You confronted him, expressed your hurt, and he showed little remorse, saying it ""doesn't mean anything"" and that he has ""nothing to apologize for.""
3. You are asking if you are at fault (""AITA"") for being upset about these photos.

Analysis:
- Taking sexualized photos of an ex while in a new, exclusive relationship is generally considered disrespectful and a breach of trust, even if there is no physical cheating.
- Your boyfriend's lack of remorse and failure to acknowledge your feelings further compounds the issue.
- You are not at fault for feeling hurt or upset by this; your reaction is reasonable given the circumstances.

The author is not outing him, shaming him, or being disrespectful; rather, she is expressing acceptance and concern for his comfort and self-acceptance. The boyfriend's anger and refusal to engage in honest communication, especially after evidence to the contrary (the porn, his own admissions), is what leads to the conflict. While the author could perhaps be more sensitive to his discomfort, the main issue is the boyfriend's unwillingness to be honest with himself or his partner, and his lashing out at her for trying to discuss it.",stop,692,175,867

Final Answer: Other

**Reasoning:**
- The author (you) has set a reasonable boundary: you’re happy to give up your bed for your sister and her kids, but only when you don’t have work the next day, as sleeping on the sofa affects your rest and job performance.
- Your sister and parents disregarded this boundary by adding an extra night without asking or discussing it with you, and then criticized you for expressing discomfort.
- You are not being selfish; you are balancing significant responsibilities (caring for disabled parents, working, and accommodating family).
- The fault lies with your sister (for not asking) and your parents (for not supporting your reasonable request and calling you selfish).

Therefore, the other people involved are at fault for not respecting your boundaries and for their reaction when you voiced your concerns.",stop,455,174,629

Final Answer: Everybody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author made a joke that unintentionally hurt M’s feelings, especially given the context of income differences and her pregnancy. The author did apologize immediately, which shows some awareness and responsibility.
- M, while understandably sensitive, escalated the situation by screaming and later continued to blame the author, even after the apology and after initially attributing her reaction to pregnancy hormones.
- There was a lack of clear communication and empathy on both sides: the author could have acknowledged M’s research and concerns more, and M could have communicated her feelings without escalating.
- Both parties contributed to the breakdown in communication and the resulting fallout.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that both share some responsibility for the situation.",stop,719,157,876

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
You (the author) were instructed by your employer not to share the news of your permanent contract, and you followed those instructions. You did not intentionally deceive or hurt your friend; you simply complied with a workplace request. Afterward, your friend’s reaction—repeated, insistent messaging—seems to stem from her own emotional struggles and loneliness, not from any wrongdoing on your part. While her behavior may be uncomfortable and even inappropriate, it is not the result of any fault or malice on your end. You are not obligated to maintain a friendship that feels overwhelming or unhealthy to you, especially given the circumstances.

Therefore, in this situation, **nobody is truly at fault**: you acted appropriately, and your friend’s actions, while problematic, are more a reflection of her personal difficulties than a clear moral failing.",stop,578,184,762

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
This situation is a classic case of cross-cultural/language miscommunication. The British customer’s phrase “keep twenty, give me back the rest” could be interpreted in two ways:
- “Keep $20 as a tip, give me the rest of my change” (which is how the author interpreted it).
- “Give me back $30, keep the rest as a tip” (which is what the customer apparently meant).

The author acted in good faith, did the math, and even double-checked with a calculator. The customer did not clarify their intent, and their friend agreed with the author’s math. The coworker’s insistence that the author “perceived them wrong” is not entirely fair, as the phrase was ambiguous and the author made a reasonable interpretation.

No one acted maliciously or with clear negligence; it was simply a misunderstanding. Therefore, **nobody is truly at fault**—it was a miscommunication that could have been resolved with clearer language or a brief clarification.",stop,414,219,633

Final Answer: Other

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author (the high school senior) agreed to play touch football, which is generally a low-risk activity, especially among friends and family.
- The sister's boyfriend, however, escalated the game by tackling the author ""as hard as he could"" in what was supposed to be a touch football game. This is a clear violation of the expected conduct for such a game and resulted in a serious injury.
- The sister's reaction was dismissive and unsupportive, despite knowing how important hockey is to the author.
- The author is asking if he is ""in the wrong"" for being upset and not speaking to his sister much since the incident.
- The injury and the resulting consequences were not the author's fault; he did not act recklessly or irresponsibly.
- The primary fault lies with the sister's boyfriend for his reckless behavior, and the sister for her lack of empathy and support.

Final Answer: Author

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Summary:**  
   - The author dislikes Sharon due to her cold behavior and negative social media posts.
   - The author wants to invite Paul (fiancé’s long-time friend) to the wedding, but not Sharon.
   - The fiancé thinks it would be rude to exclude Sharon and worries Paul wouldn’t attend without her.

2. **Social Norms:**  
   - It is generally considered rude to invite a married person to a wedding without their spouse, unless there are extreme circumstances (e.g., abuse, safety concerns).
   - Sharon’s behavior is unpleasant and rude, but not to the level that would justify a social snub of this magnitude.

3. **Fault Assessment:**  
   - Sharon is rude and posts mean things online, but the question is about whether the author would be at fault for excluding her.
   - The author would be breaking a strong social norm by inviting Paul without his wife, which is widely seen as disrespectful to both Paul and Sharon.
   - The fiancé is correct that this would likely cause drama and hurt feelings.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - While Sharon’s behavior is bad, the author would be at fault for escalating the situation and violating etiquette by excluding her.
   - The correct answer is that the author is at fault if they choose to invite Paul without Sharon.

- The friend is struggling with addiction, but asking for money (even if possibly for the wrong reasons) is a symptom of that struggle, not necessarily a moral failing.

Final Answer: Other

---

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Mother's Behavior:** The mother is described as having a long history of abusive tendencies, including physical violence, screaming, emotional manipulation, and lack of genuine apology. These are clear signs of emotional and physical abuse, which are never justified, regardless of the circumstances.

2. **Author's Behavior:** The author admits to being ""lazy"" and not contributing much to household chores, but also explains this is due to being a busy, high-achieving student with mental health struggles. The author is a minor, still developing, and is not responsible for the overall household functioning or for managing their own trauma responses.

3. **Father's Behavior:** The father is described as emotionally distant and not very involved, but there is no indication of abusive behavior. His lack of involvement may be problematic, but it does not rise to the level of abuse.

4. **Responsibility for Abuse:** Abuse is always the responsibility of the abuser. While other family members may have their own shortcomings (e.g., not helping enough around the house), these do not justify or excuse abusive behavior.

5. **Household Chores:** While it is reasonable for parents to expect some help from their children, the way the mother handles these expectations (through abuse) is not appropriate. The author and father may share some responsibility for not contributing more, but this is a separate issue from the abuse.

6. **Conclusion:** The primary and overwhelming fault lies with the mother for her abusive behavior. The author and father may have areas for improvement, but they are not at fault for the abuse.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is upset that their mom did not take more medicine or drink more fluids while sick, and blames her for ""not really attempting to fight the sickness,"" which the author believes led to them getting sick.
- However, adults have autonomy over their own medical choices, and there is no guarantee that taking over-the-counter cold medicine or zinc would have prevented transmission or shortened the illness in a way that would have protected the author.
- The mom did take Advil for her fever, so she was not ignoring her symptoms entirely.
- The author acknowledges that there are ""no guarantees"" and that they could have gotten sick anyway.
- Blaming someone for getting you sick, especially when they are already unwell and you are caring for them, is generally unfair unless they were being reckless (e.g., refusing to isolate, coughing on you deliberately, etc.), which is not described here.
- The mom apologized and did not deny the possibility of transmission.
- Therefore, the author is at fault for blaming their mom for getting them sick and for her personal choices in managing her illness.",stop,540,236,776

Final Answer: Other

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Ian's Behavior:** Ian insulted your boyfriend, acted out in strange ways (refusing to talk, using sign language), and made comments to others about your relationship not lasting. These are all inappropriate and immature responses to his own disappointment.

2. **Communication:** You communicated about your boyfriend when you started dating him. You were not obligated to ""announce"" your relationship status in any special way, especially since you did mention it.

3. **Expectations:** Ian assumed you knew about his feelings, but you had no reason to know unless he told you directly. It's not your responsibility to intuit unspoken crushes.

4. **Guilt:** Feeling guilty is understandable, but you did nothing wrong. Ian is responsible for his own feelings and actions, and he is at fault for lashing out and blaming you for not knowing about his crush.

5. **Conclusion:** Ian (the ""other"" in this scenario) is at fault for his behavior and for making you feel guilty about something that was not your responsibility.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The author has set a strict boundary: he will not stay with his girlfriend if she goes clubbing, regardless of her reasons or behavior.
2. The girlfriend initially protested but ultimately agreed not to go clubbing to avoid losing the relationship.
3. The girlfriend later expresses a desire to go clubbing with friends and asks if the author would break up with her if she did.
4. The author becomes upset, reiterates his stance, and ends the call.

Analysis:
- The author is attempting to control his girlfriend's social activities based on his own discomfort and assumptions about clubbing and her friends.
- The girlfriend is communicating openly about her desires and is seeking clarity about the consequences.
- The author’s reasoning is based on stereotypes and mistrust (""you should see the type of girls that club here in the UK, and the usual 'it was a drunken mistake'""), rather than trust in his partner.

The author is at fault for setting an unreasonable and controlling ultimatum, rather than addressing his insecurities or working towards a compromise. The girlfriend is not at fault for wanting to socialize with her friends or for communicating openly.",stop,509,248,757

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author created ""starter pack"" memes for friends, poking fun at their quirks, which was initially well-received.
- For friend T, the author was asked to ""pull no punches"" and to avoid certain ""low effort"" jokes.
- The author, knowing T's insecurities, included references to T's ""deepest insecurities"" in the meme.
- The author hesitated, even making T ""sign a consent form,"" indicating awareness that the content might be hurtful.
- After posting, T reacted negatively, then disappeared from the group, later revealing the meme was the reason.
- While T did request a roast, the author knowingly targeted sensitive insecurities, which is a step beyond lighthearted teasing.
- The author had reason to believe the meme could be hurtful, as shown by their hesitation and the ""consent form.""
- The negative outcome (T leaving the group and being hurt) was a direct result of the author's actions.

Therefore, while T did ask for a roast, the author is at fault for crossing the line into personal and potentially hurtful territory, especially after recognizing the risk. The responsibility lies with the author for not exercising better judgment and empathy.",stop,781,261,1042

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author put up a ""Do not knock"" sign to avoid being disturbed by package deliveries, which is a reasonable request for a new mom.
- The sign worked as intended for package couriers, but also influenced the behavior of a food delivery person, who left the food without knocking, resulting in cold food.
- The food delivery person followed the instructions on the sign, likely out of respect for the request.
- The author did not intend for the sign to apply to food deliveries, but the sign did not specify exceptions.
- The husband’s comment (""we were asking for it"") suggests that the outcome was a predictable consequence of the sign, but it does not make anyone an ""asshole"" or at fault in a moral sense.
- The food delivery person used reasonable judgment based on the sign.
- The author was not malicious or negligent, just unaware of the unintended consequence.

Final Answer: Nobody

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Situation Overview:**  
   - The author (you) is upset after hearing from a mutual friend that your girlfriend (GF) plans to break up with you after she moves.
   - You confront her via text, expressing frustration about feeling ""dragged along"" and not being told her intentions.
   - She responds that she didn't want to hurt you, wanted to make the most of the time together, and struggles with long-distance relationships.
   - Both of you have depression, which may affect communication and emotional responses.

2. **Key Points of Conflict:**  
   - Miscommunication about when she told you she was moving.
   - She didn't explicitly say she would break up after moving, but you found out through a friend.
   - She says she didn't want to hurt you and wanted you to be happy for a while.

3. **Fault Analysis:**  
   - **Author:** Expressed feelings honestly, but also accused her of ""dragging you along."" However, you were reacting to a difficult and emotional situation.
   - **GF:** Did not clearly communicate her intentions about breaking up after moving, but her motivation was to avoid hurting you and to enjoy the present.
   - **Both:** There is a lack of clear communication, but both parties seem to be acting out of emotional vulnerability rather than malice or manipulation.

4. **Intentions and Harm:**  
   - Neither party appears to have acted with the intention to hurt the other.
   - The GF's lack of communication was motivated by a desire to spare your feelings, not to deceive.
   - You reacted emotionally, which is understandable given the circumstances.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - This is a situation where both people are struggling with difficult emotions and imperfect communication, but neither is truly ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense.
   - It's a sad and complicated situation, but not one where blame should be assigned.

**Summary:**  
Nobody is truly at fault here. Both of you are dealing with a tough situation as best you can, given your emotional states and the circumstances. Apologizing for any harsh words or misunderstandings could help, but you did not ""fuck up"" in a way that makes you solely responsible.",stop,638,471,1109

**1. The Folder’s Existence:**  
- The author kept a private folder of photos (not nudes, just faces) of past sexual partners, as a personal memory aid.
- The photos are not shared, not explicit, and were taken from public sources (selfies, Facebook).

**2. The Discovery:**  
- The author’s boyfriend found the folder after being given access to the phone.
- The author explained the folder’s purpose and that it predated the relationship.

**3. The Boyfriend’s Reaction:**  
- He became very upset, accused the author of lying, and left.

**4. The Author’s Current Stance:**  
- The author does not want to delete the folder, seeing it as a personal diary.

---

**Fault Analysis:**

- **Author:**  
  - Did not hide or share the folder; it was private.
  - Did not update the folder during the relationship.
  - Was honest when asked about it.
  - The folder is arguably unusual, but not inherently harmful or deceitful.

- **Boyfriend:**  
  - Reacted with anger and accusations.
  - Did not listen to the explanation.
  - Threw the phone and left, refusing further communication.

---

**Ethical Considerations:**
- Keeping private mementos of past relationships is not uncommon, though the form (a folder of faces) is unusual.
- The author did not violate trust or privacy, nor did they hide anything intentionally.
- The boyfriend’s reaction is understandable from an emotional perspective, but his behavior (anger, accusations, refusal to communicate) is not constructive.

---

**Conclusion:**  
- The author is not at fault for having the folder, as it was private, not malicious, and predated the relationship.
- The boyfriend’s reaction is disproportionate and unconstructive, but it stems from emotional hurt, not malice.
- There is no clear wrongdoing, just a clash of expectations and boundaries.

**Reasoning:**  
This situation describes a conflict of values and expectations in a relationship, not a clear-cut case of someone being ""at fault"" in a moral or ethical sense. The author is expressing frustration about perceived double standards and a mismatch in expectations around gender roles, finances, and chores. The wife has her own set of beliefs, which may be influenced by upbringing or culture. Both parties are acting according to their own values, and the conflict arises from incompatibility rather than malice or wrongdoing.

While the wife’s selective application of traditional and modern roles may seem unfair to the author, and the author’s frustration is understandable, neither is objectively ""at fault"" for having their own perspectives. The real issue is a lack of alignment and communication about core values, which is common in relationships and best addressed through honest discussion or counseling.

   - R, a group member, consistently does not contribute, tries to get answers from others, and is generally negative.
   - You decided to stop helping R and asked him to ignore you, ending the friendship.

2. **Fault analysis:**  
   - **You (Author):** You did your work, tried to organize the group, and only cut off R after repeated negative behavior and lack of contribution. You are not obligated to maintain a friendship with someone whose values and actions you dislike.
   - **R (Other):** R did not contribute to group work, tried to benefit from others' efforts, and displayed negative behavior. However, the question is not about whether R is at fault for the group work, but whether you are at fault for ending the friendship and refusing to help.
   - **Everybody:** There is no evidence that the rest of the group or others are at fault.
   - **Nobody:** You are within your rights to set boundaries and end relationships that are not healthy for you. R is responsible for his own actions, but you are not at fault for your response.

**Reasoning:**  
You communicated your boundaries clearly and honestly when she expressed her feelings. You offered to stop the sexual aspect of your relationship to avoid hurting her, but she chose to continue. As long as both parties are adults, informed, and consenting, and you have not misled her, you are not at fault.

Final Answer: Everybody

**Reasoning:**

- **Author's responsibility:** The author continued to use the command hook after being (albeit drunkenly) told not to, and admits to sometimes ""forgetfully"" using it even after the issue was raised. While the author may not have remembered the initial conversation, they were made aware of the issue afterward and still sometimes disregarded the request.
- **Roommate J's responsibility:** J's method of communicating (waiting until 1am when the author was drunk, then using passive-aggressive sticky notes and hiding the towel) was not a mature or direct way to handle the situation. This escalated the conflict unnecessarily.
- **Other roommates:** The other housemates ""ganging up"" on the author rather than helping mediate or de-escalate the situation also contributed to the negative environment.
- **Proportionality:** The conflict is over a minor issue (a $2 command hook), and both sides have escalated it beyond what is reasonable.

**Summary:** Both the author and the roommate (and to some extent, the other housemates) have contributed to the escalation and poor handling of a minor issue. Therefore, ""Everybody"" is at fault.",stop,760,254,1014

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
While there are several people behaving poorly in this situation (students putting sticks in wheels, pedestrians being rude), the author admits to threatening to run over pedestrians, which is an escalation and an inappropriate response. Regardless of frustration, threatening harm is not justified. The author recognizes this was ""a bit harsh,"" which shows some self-awareness. The other parties may have been rude or inconsiderate, but the author’s threat crosses a line, making them at fault in this specific interaction.",stop,513,113,626

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
This situation describes a conflict between the author and his wife during a very stressful and emotional time. The author is recovering from major surgery and is experiencing pain and complications. His wife, while supportive and present, makes a comment that seems to minimize his suffering, which understandably upsets him. However, both parties are under significant stress: the author is physically suffering, and the wife is emotionally distressed seeing her partner in pain.

No one is acting maliciously or with clear intent to harm. The wife's comment may be insensitive, but it likely comes from her own stress and exhaustion. The author's reaction is also understandable given his condition. This is a classic case of miscommunication and emotional strain in a difficult situation, not a case of clear fault.

Therefore, **nobody** is truly ""at fault"" here; it's a tough situation for both, and emotions are running high.",stop,551,192,743

Final Answer: Everybody

**Reasoning:**
- The author is breaking a posted house rule by eating in their room, even if they feel justified due to food theft.
- The other roommates (or at least one of them) are at fault for stealing the author's food, which is a clear violation of trust and basic courtesy.
- The homeowner is at fault for not addressing the food theft issue, which is a significant problem in shared living situations, and for inconsistent enforcement of house rules (complaining about noise but not about food theft).
- Everyone involved is contributing to the conflict: the author by breaking the rule, the thief by stealing, and the homeowner by not managing the situation effectively.

1. **Background**: The author started dating her boyfriend in late 2016. He had an ex-girlfriend of 9 years who lost her house and needed a place to stay. He let her move in, didn't charge rent, and loaned her a significant amount of money, knowing he likely wouldn't get it back.

2. **Relationship Dynamics**: The author and her boyfriend were together, but he wouldn't let her come to his house for fear of the ex seeing them. Their relationship was kept somewhat secret for 8 months, and the author felt like a ""runner up"" while the ex stayed in his house.

3. **Current Situation**: The ex is gone, the author moved in, but had to beg to do so and is now paying rent. The boyfriend's mother is still friendly with the ex and her son, and the author is upset about seeing a picture of the ex's son at the mother's house.

4. **Resentment**: The author feels deep resentment over how she was treated during the period the ex was living with her boyfriend, and is upset about the ongoing relationship between the boyfriend's mother and the ex.

**Fault Analysis:**
- The boyfriend could be seen as at fault for not setting clearer boundaries with his ex and for not being more transparent or assertive in his relationship with the author.
- The ex is not really at fault for accepting help when in need, though she could be at fault for not repaying the loan.
- The mother is not at fault for maintaining a relationship with someone she knew for 9 years, especially if she doesn't know the full story.
- The author is not at fault for feeling hurt or resentful, but her reaction to the photo (leaving abruptly) is more about her feelings than anyone else's wrongdoing.

**Conclusion:**  
The main source of the author's resentment is the boyfriend's actions (or lack thereof) in handling his relationships and boundaries. The mother is acting on incomplete information, and the ex is not directly involved anymore. The author is justified in her feelings, but not at fault for the situation.

Final Answer: Author

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The coworker’s repeated, unwanted advances and physical contact are clearly inappropriate and constitute harassment. She is at fault for this behavior.
- However, the author’s response—making a cruel, body-shaming comment (“I hope they make whaling legal again so somebody harpoons you”)—is unnecessarily hurtful and targets her appearance rather than her actions.
- While the author was provoked and had legitimate grievances, responding with a personal, body-shaming insult crosses a line and is not an appropriate or justified way to handle the situation.
- The correct way to address harassment is to continue to set boundaries, document the behavior, and escalate to management or HR, even if the workplace culture is dismissive.
- Therefore, while the coworker is at fault for harassment, the author is at fault for the specific action of making a cruel, body-shaming remark. Since the question is about whether the author went too far, and who is at fault for the *action described* (the insult), the author is at fault for that action.",stop,392,228,620

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
The author was confronted by an older man who expressed concern about the baby's clothing in cool weather. The author responded by telling the man to mind his own business and did not engage further, even after the man persisted. While unsolicited advice from strangers can be annoying, the older man's comments were not aggressive or threatening—he was expressing concern for the child's well-being, which, while perhaps culturally influenced and unwelcome, was not malicious.

The author escalated the situation by telling the man to ""mind his own business"" rather than simply acknowledging the concern and moving on. This response was unnecessarily confrontational, especially given the cultural context where elders may feel a responsibility to comment on child care. The author could have defused the situation politely.

Therefore, the author is at fault for being rude in response to a non-hostile, if intrusive, comment.",stop,676,187,863

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**  
You are not at fault for not contributing financially, given your own difficult circumstances (supporting your homeless family, being a full-time student with no job, and already sending money home). While your friends are understandably emotional and want to help, it is unreasonable for them to demand money from you and insult you for not contributing, especially when you have already expressed your support and condolences. The situation is emotionally charged, but you are not an ""asshole"" for prioritizing your own survival and responsibilities. The blame does not rest on you, nor is it fair to say ""everybody"" is at fault, as the main issue is the unreasonable demand from your friends, but their actions stem from stress and concern for their friend. Thus, in terms of your actions, you are not at fault.",stop,481,177,658

You responded honestly to the RSVP with ""Maybe,"" which was a valid option provided. You also explained your situation and your intent to try your best to attend.

**Reasoning:**  
You are not at fault for refusing to drive someone who repeatedly chooses not to get a license, refuses public transportation, and spends money on non-essentials while claiming poverty. You have communicated your boundaries and reasons clearly. While her behavior may be frustrating or inconsiderate, simply asking for a ride is not inherently ""at fault"" behavior—she is allowed to ask, and you are allowed to say no. The situation is a clash of expectations and boundaries, not a clear-cut case of wrongdoing. Therefore, nobody is strictly ""at fault"" here.",stop,430,129,559

Final Answer: Nobody

**Reasoning:**

Step by step:

1. **Author’s Actions:** The author is being supportive, preparing healthy meals, and reminding his pregnant wife to check her blood sugar due to gestational diabetes. His concern is for both her health and the baby's, and he is not being controlling or malicious—he is responding to a legitimate medical risk.

2. **Wife’s Actions:** The wife is under significant stress (work, school, pregnancy, gestational diabetes). She sometimes neglects her diet and blood sugar checks, which is not ideal, but her reaction (frustration, feeling nagged) is understandable given her emotional and physical state.

3. **Intentions:** Both parties have good intentions. The author wants to help; the wife is overwhelmed and may feel micromanaged, but she is not intentionally endangering herself or the baby.

4. **Fault Assessment:** There is no clear malice, neglect, or irresponsibility from either party. The conflict arises from stress, concern, and the challenges of managing a high-risk pregnancy, not from anyone acting wrongly.

5. **Conclusion:** This is a difficult situation with understandable emotions on both sides. Neither is truly ""at fault""—it’s a matter of stress, communication, and care.

This is a classic case of a stressful situation where both people are doing their best, and the conflict is a result of circumstances, not fault.",stop,823,303,1126

Final Answer: Author

**Reasoning:**  
You (the author) hosted a party and made a reasonable effort to include the guest: you talked to him, introduced him to someone with similar interests, and suggested he join a game. However, when he continued to feel left out and refused to participate, you told him to leave. While it’s understandable to feel frustrated, telling a guest to leave your party because they’re not socializing enough is generally considered rude and unwelcoming, especially since he was not causing any disruption—just being quiet and awkward. The guest may have social anxiety or simply be shy, and as a host, it’s generally your responsibility to make all guests feel comfortable, within reason. Telling him to leave was an overreaction and not the most gracious way to handle the situation.

Therefore, you (the author) are most at fault in this situation.",stop,571,187,758

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is voluntarily allowing their friend to live with them, not pay bills, and share food.
- The friend is not demanding food, but rather silently hoping for a share, and the author usually gives in.
- There is no evidence of explicit coercion, manipulation, or agreement being broken.
- The situation is based on mutual (if perhaps unspoken) consent and tolerance.
- The linked image (a dog staring at food) suggests the ""best friend"" is a pet dog, not a human.
- Given this, the described behavior is normal for a pet, and the author is not being taken advantage of by a person.

Final Answer: Nobody

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is expressing confusion and concern about the nature of their feelings and the lack of physical intimacy in the relationship.
- The author is not blaming or mistreating their partner, nor is the partner at fault for her own trauma or difficulties with intimacy.
- Both individuals have communicated about the issue, and the partner has even said she would understand if the author left.
- The author is staying partly out of concern for the partner’s well-being, not out of malice or manipulation.
- There is no evidence of wrongdoing, malice, or neglect from either party.
- This is a difficult, emotionally complex situation, but not one where anyone is clearly ""at fault.""

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The author is expressing a desire to leave a relationship where her boundaries are not respected (her boyfriend ignores her ""no"" and physically insists on things she is uncomfortable with).
- The boyfriend's behavior, as described, is disrespectful and disregards consent, which is a serious issue.
- The author is considering leaving the relationship to pursue personal growth and happiness, which is a reasonable and healthy response to her needs and the situation.
- There is no indication that the author has done anything wrong or harmful in this scenario.
- The boyfriend is at fault for not respecting boundaries and for his dismissive attitude toward the author's wishes (e.g., not using her preferred name).
- Therefore, the person at fault in this situation is the boyfriend, not the author.
