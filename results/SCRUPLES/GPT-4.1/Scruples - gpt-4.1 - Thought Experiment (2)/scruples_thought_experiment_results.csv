- The central responsibility is assigned to the primary actor whose actions directly caused harm (here, the mother – ""Other""), especially when manipulation and power imbalances are present.
- Minor/shared responsibility among others is noted but not sufficient to override the primary assignment.
- The author is not at fault when manipulated as a child/teen and not in a position of power.
- A “Nobody” or “Info” answer is only chosen if there is no clear harm or not enough evidence, respectively.

Given these principles, the most likely correct classification is ""Other"" (i.e., the mother/another person is at fault, not the author, not everybody, and not nobody).
