Final Answer: Nobody

You are not an asshole for not wanting kids. This is a fundamental, personal life choice, and you have been clear and consistent about your position from the beginning. You established a child-free future as a core tenet of your relationship with your boyfriend, and he explicitly agreed to it. Holding firm to this deeply held conviction does not make you wrong.

Your boyfriend is also not necessarily an asshole, but his actions are becoming problematic. People are allowed to change their minds, and his experience raising a puppy may have genuinely awakened a desire for fatherhood he didn't know he had. However, his change of heart fundamentally alters the foundational agreement upon which your shared future was built. While he has a right to his new feelings, he does not have the right to pressure you or disregard your well-established position. His jokes about pregnancy and a nursery, while perhaps not malicious, are insensitive and dismissive of your feelings. They place the entire emotional burden of this new incompatibility on you.

The core issue here is not about assigning blame but recognizing a profound and potentially irreconcilable incompatibility. Neither of you is an ""asshole"" for wanting what you want out of life. However, this is one of the few disagreements in a relationship where compromise is impossible—one cannot have half a child. The situation requires a serious, non-joking conversation about whether your life paths have diverged permanently. Your boyfriend needs to respect your position, and you both need to decide if a future together is viable when your fundamental life goals are now in direct opposition.",stop,1,1746,766,2737

The core ethical dilemma is navigating external pressure while also impartially evaluating the relationship at the center of the conflict.

The critique of the previous analysis is astute. While your family's delivery is problematic—constant complaining, creating arguments, and using guilt are forms of emotional pressure—it is an error to dismiss the substance of their concerns simply because their reasoning is ""old-fashioned."" The underlying principles they are referencing—effort, care, and investment in a partner—are timeless. The question is whether their observations, filtered through their traditional lens, are pointing to a genuine issue.

Your family's behavior is ethically flawed. By creating a constant state of conflict, they are making your happiness conditional on their approval. This is a controlling dynamic that places an unfair emotional burden on you, forcing you to constantly defend your choices. Their actions are likely causing more damage than the behaviors they are criticizing.

However, it is also necessary to evaluate your boyfriend's actions independently of your family's pressure. A partner living a 15-minute drive away who consistently allows you to take a 30+ minute, two-bus journey to see him, especially when you cannot afford a car and he can, could be seen as lacking consideration. Similarly, while splitting bills is standard, a consistent pattern where a working partner does not occasionally treat their non-working student partner, especially when this is a known point of contention, could be interpreted as a lack of generosity or investment. These actions may be perfectly acceptable to you, but they could also be legitimate data points suggesting a low-effort or imbalanced dynamic.

This creates a complex, multi-faceted problem:
1.  Your family is handling their concerns poorly, creating a toxic environment.

Final Answer: Author

This is a classic case where a seemingly small, impulsive action violates trust and personal boundaries, and the subsequent reaction pours gasoline on the fire. The author is unequivocally the one at fault.

**1. Why liking the photo was a significant breach:**

The core issue isn't the technical act of liking and unliking a photo. The issue is the violation of trust in a moment of vulnerability. Your sister was sharing something personal and sensitive with you: her crush. This was an act of confidence. By taking her phone and interacting with her private social world without her consent, you breached that trust. You took a situation where she felt safe and turned it into one of potential exposure and embarrassment. It doesn't matter if the notification disappeared; you weaponized her vulnerability for a cheap laugh at her expense. It was a ""dick move"" because it was a betrayal of the intimate context she had created.

**2. How you made it exponentially worse:**

Your second, and arguably worse, mistake was telling her she was ""overreacting."" This is one of the most invalidating things you can say to someone who is expressing hurt. You were essentially telling her: ""Your feelings are wrong, and my intent (to make a joke) is more important than the impact my actions had on you.""

This dismissal communicates a profound lack of respect and empathy. It shifted the focus from your poor judgment to her ""incorrect"" emotional response. Her anger escalated because you weren't just a sibling who made a dumb mistake; you became a sibling who made a dumb mistake and then refused to acknowledge the hurt it caused, instead blaming her for feeling that hurt. Her friends agreeing with her isn't about them ganging up on you; it's a sign that your actions were objectively out of line.

This refined response incorporates the insights from the critique, aiming for a more balanced, nuanced, and constructive analysis.

The core of this situation is a conflict between your developing autonomy and your father's rigid, control-oriented parenting style. While you bear some responsibility for minor miscommunications, the disproportionate and harmful nature of your father's response places the primary ethical fault with him.

**Ethical Analysis of Actions:**

1.  **Your Conduct:**
    *   **The Initial Decision:** You made a reasonable judgment call. Given the cold and rainy weather, and the established precedent of being excused for either condition separately, substituting an indoor workout for an outdoor run was a logical and responsible decision. You acted in good faith based on the existing rules.
    *   **Communication:** You were proactive in your communication by texting your father and informing him in person. While you could have been more specific about the *type* of workout (e.g., ""I'm doing a strength workout instead of cardio because of the weather""), your actions demonstrated an intent to uphold your end of the fitness agreement.
    *   **Conflict Navigation:** During the argument, you attempted to use reason and logic, referencing his own stated goals (self-discipline) and even his own phrasing. Your emotional response (crying) appears to be a genuine reaction to distress, not a manipulative tactic.

The communication breakdown and hurt feelings between the author and her ex are symptoms of the immense trauma and stress the author is experiencing.

The author's actions—pushing him away, not explaining the situation, feeling possessive—are understandable, albeit confusing for him, as they are classic trauma responses. She is in survival mode after being physically abused, disowned, and suffering a miscarriage alone. Her priority is self-preservation, not managing his feelings perfectly.

The ex-boyfriend's actions—not checking on her after the incident with her brother, pushing for sex again, and moving on quickly—are insensitive and self-centered, especially given their long history. However, he is also a teenager who was kept in the dark about the horrific abuse she endured. His frustration stems from being shut out and told she only ever saw him as a friend, which, from his perspective, feels like being led on.

Both individuals are young and ill-equipped to handle the gravity of this situation. They have both hurt each other through poor communication and immature actions. However, the author's behavior is a direct result of severe trauma and abuse, which is the most significant ethical factor here. Assigning blame in the conventional AITA sense is inappropriate and unhelpful. The real ""assholes"" are the parents who abused and abandoned their child. Since that is not an option, and both parties in the direct conflict have contributed to the misunderstanding and hurt, ""Everybody"" is the most fitting classification.

Final Answer: Other

The boyfriend is the asshole in this situation. While the couple's lack of clear financial rules is a foundational problem, his reaction to the author's purchase is hypocritical, controlling, and unreasonable, making him the primary wrongdoer in this specific conflict.

The author's purchase of $130 heels for a mandatory work event is a legitimate ""work expense,"" a category they supposedly agreed upon for the joint account. Given that she contributes 70% of the funds and the event required a specific dress code she could not otherwise meet, this is a reasonable and justifiable use of the shared money. While it would have been better to discuss the purchase beforehand, her failure to do so is a minor communication misstep, not an asshole move.

The boyfriend's behavior, however, is egregious for several key reasons:

1.  **Glaring Hypocrisy:** He spends over **$1,200 per month** ($300/week) on weed, which he dubiously classifies as a work expense. To then attack the author's one-time, genuinely work-related $130 purchase is an act of staggering hypocrisy. He is holding her to a standard he flagrantly violates himself, on a much larger and more consistent scale.

2.  **Controlling and Dismissive Behavior:** He didn't just question the expense; he immediately invalidated her reasoning (""That's obviously not for work""), belittled her purchase (""it’s probably like $20 tops""), and demanded she repay the account. This isn't a partner seeking to understand; it's someone attempting to exert financial control over a partner who is, by a wide margin, the primary contributor to the account.

3.  **Poor Conflict Resolution:** Instead of having a mature conversation, he escalated the argument and then stormed out.",stop,3,8572,1959,11256

**Original Post Analysis:**

*   **Core Conflict:** The user (16M) bought a personal Pro Controller with his own money for a shared family console (Nintendo Switch). His younger brother (11M) wants to use it. The user refused.
*   **User's Justifications for Refusal:**
    1.  **Ownership:** He paid for it with his own birthday money.
    2.  **Brother's History:** The brother has a history of being careless with shared items (dropping the Switch, throwing Joy-Cons) and financially irresponsible (prioritizing V-Bucks over replacing a lost charger, then using the user's).
    3.  **Fear of Damage:** The user is concerned the brother's carelessness and temper will lead to the new, expensive controller being broken.
    4.  **Specific Need:** The user bought the controller to solve a specific problem (Joy-Con drift) that was preventing him from enjoying a game he also paid for (Switch Online subscription).
    5.  **Brother's Alternatives:** The brother's primary game (Fortnite) can be played on another device (laptop), and his other activity (YouTube) is not significantly hampered by Joy-Con drift.
*   **Brother's/Mother's Arguments:**
    1.  **Fairness/Sharing:** The console is shared, so accessories should be shared.
    2.  **Reciprocity:** The user has borrowed the brother's headphones in the past.

When this came out I of course believed ...",Author,,,0.9285714285714286,True,"This is a situation of profound ethical complexity where your duties to different people are in direct conflict, and your actions, regardless of intent, carry a significant risk of causing severe harm. The core of the issue is not just about managing consequences, but about the inherent nature of your actions and the duties you hold.

**Ethical Analysis:**

1.  **The Inherent Betrayal of Trust (Deontology):** Your primary ethical failing is not the *risk* of your friend finding out, but the act of deception itself. When you supported your friend through her trauma, you accepted a profound duty of loyalty and care. A friendship, particularly one forged in such a vulnerable context, is built on a foundation of trust. By secretly pursuing a relationship with the person who caused her trauma, you are actively violating that trust in the present moment. The friendship becomes a lie from your side, regardless of whether she ever discovers the truth. The deception is not a tool to prevent harm; it is the harm itself, corroding the integrity of a relationship you claim to value.

2.  **The Nature of ""Change"" and Accountability:** You state that the abuser ""has changed."" While personal growth is possible, true change and remorse in the context of severe harm like sexual abuse require more than just personal improvement and therapy. A crucial component of accountability is accepting the consequences of one's actions and taking responsibility for the harm caused. This includes respecting the victim's boundaries and right to a safe space, free from the perpetrator. By entering a relationship that necessitates hiding from the victim, the abuser is not demonstrating full accountability; she is participating in a deception that prioritizes her desires over the victim's well-being and right to an honest support system. Her ""change"" cannot be considered complete if it requires the betrayal of the very person she harmed.

My analysis acknowledges that the core issue is not the transactional nature of a mobile game, but the emotional dynamics and expectations within a romantic relationship. The author is technically correct that he is not obligated to trade his Pokémon. However, his failure to recognize the emotional significance of the situation for his partner, his dismissive attitude towards her feelings (""childish,"" ""annoyed""), and his lack of reciprocity transform a petty game dispute into a significant relational conflict.

The girlfriend's emotional reaction, while perhaps disproportionate to the stimulus of a game, stems from a place of hurt and a perceived lack of care from her partner. She isn't upset about the rules of the game; she's upset that her partner celebrated his luck at her expense (the dancing) and then prioritized a digital collectible over her happiness, especially when she had previously offered him a similar, selfless gesture.

The author's focus on being logically ""right"" (it's his Pokémon, it's just a game) causes him to be relationally ""wrong."" He failed to show empathy and kindness, which are far more important in a partnership than adhering to the unwritten rules of Pokémon Go. His annoyance and dismissal of her feelings, rather than his decision to keep the Pokémon, are what make his behavior problematic.

Final Answer: Nobody

Your action of ignoring your brother's girlfriend does not make you an asshole; it is a reasonable, non-confrontational strategy for self-preservation in a complex and volatile family dynamic. You are caught between two undesirable options: engaging with someone whose behavior you find disrespectful (which could lead to a ""blow up"") or disengaging entirely. Given the context of your brother's substance abuse, his anger towards you for setting boundaries, and your parents' fear-based approach, your silence is a form of boundary-setting. It is a de-escalation tactic aimed at protecting your own peace without actively antagonizing anyone.

Your brother's girlfriend's behavior is objectively disrespectful and violates basic social norms, particularly as a guest in someone else's home. Your brother is also acting unethically by enabling her behavior and attempting to guilt you for not ""welcoming"" someone who is actively rude to you and your parents. However, his judgment is clouded by his own significant issues, and his actions likely stem from a place of defensiveness and addiction rather than simple malice. Finally, your parents, while enabling the situation, are operating from a position of fear for their son's well-being, which is an understandable, albeit ineffective, motivation.

In this dysfunctional system, no single person is ""the asshole."" Rather, this is a situation where multiple individuals are responding, however imperfectly, to the central crisis of your brother's addiction and its fallout. You are choosing the path of least engagement to protect yourself, which is a valid and ethically sound choice.",stop,3,3908,1562,6116

The Sister-in-Law (SIL) and her family are acting unethically in this situation. While the SIL's circumstances as a single mother are challenging, this does not justify the family's expectations or their reaction to the author's reasonable boundary-setting.

The family's ethical missteps are rooted in a series of flawed assumptions and behaviors:

1.  **Mistaken Assumption of Obligation:** The family operates under the incorrect belief that the author's lack of paid employment automatically translates into an obligation to provide free, on-demand childcare. They fail to recognize that her time is her own, regardless of her employment status, and that she is entitled to use it for her own well-being, personal projects, and time with her husband. Her ""free time"" is not a communal resource for them to claim.
2.  **Disregard for Boundaries and Consent:** The SIL's practice of dropping off her children with little to no notice demonstrates a consistent lack of respect for the author's autonomy and schedule. True help is requested and consented to, not demanded or assumed. When the author clearly communicated a new boundary—that she would no longer be available on-demand except for emergencies—the family rejected this reasonable limit.
3.  **Use of Guilt and Social Pressure:** Instead of respecting the author's decision or attempting to find a compromise, the family resorted to negative labels (""lazy,"" ""sit on your ass""). This is a manipulative tactic intended to shame the author into compliance rather than engaging in a respectful dialogue. It shifts the focus from their unreasonable demands to a baseless attack on her character.

The author, in contrast, has acted ethically and reasonably. She initially tried to help, but when the demands became excessive and draining, she took appropriate steps. She discussed the issue with her husband to ensure they were aligned, and then communicated her new boundary to her SIL clearly and directly. Her",stop,3,7177,2365,10246

The prior ""Nobody"" classification was an oversimplification. It failed to adequately parse the distinct ethical components of the situation: the initial boundary violation, the subsequent communication breakdown, and the user's internal conflict regarding the relationship's dynamics. A more nuanced analysis is required to address the user's core ethical dilemma.

The initial act, while not intended to be malicious, was a boundary violation. The user correctly identified this, stopped immediately when asked, and apologized sincerely. This demonstrates ethical awareness and accountability. The user is not an asshole for the initial, unintentional triggering event, especially given their immediate compliance and remorse.

The girlfriend's reaction—being triggered—is valid and beyond ethical judgment. Her feelings are her own, and as a survivor of assault, she is entitled to them. Her initial anger and withdrawal are understandable parts of processing a triggering event.

However, the ethical calculus shifts during the morning interaction. The user attempts to engage in restorative communication: apologizing again, asking what their partner needs, and offering space. The girlfriend responds with prolonged silent treatment, passive aggression (kicking things), and what appears to be manipulative behavior (getting angry when the user tries to create space by leaving separately, then forcing a tense, inefficient commute). While her feelings are valid, her *actions* are not conducive to a healthy resolution and place the full burden of emotional management back onto the user.

The user's frustration in this context is an understandable human reaction, not an ethical failing. Their core question is whether it's wrong to suspect their girlfriend might be leveraging a legitimate trigger to reinforce a codependent dynamic they have been actively trying to change.

The core ethical question is whether the author is wrong (""the asshole"") for choosing a life path that prioritizes their own mental health, happiness, and sense of purpose over the specific, pre-defined expectations of their father.

The author is an adult who has found a fulfilling and stable path that directly relates to their personal life experiences as a recovering addict. This new path makes them happy and offers a future they genuinely desire. Prioritizing one's own well-being and self-determination, especially when it leads to a productive and healthy life, is not an asshole move.

The father, while likely motivated by love and fear for his child's future, is reacting in a controlling and emotionally manipulative way. He is framing the author's personal choice as a betrayal (""spitting in his face"") and a personal failure (""throwing away the future *he* built""). His predictions of doom (""dying in the street"") are designed to instill fear and coerce the author into compliance. While his fear is understandable given the author's history, his methods are inappropriate and place an unfair burden on the author. The author is not responsible for managing their father's disappointment when making fundamental life choices for themselves.

Therefore, the author is not the asshole for pursuing their own happiness and independence.

Final Answer: Author

The author is not the asshole for prioritizing her child's safety and emotional well-being over her in-laws' desire for unsupervised time. The core responsibility of a parent is to protect their child, and the author has acted consistently in service of that duty based on a clear and repeated pattern of untrustworthy behavior from the MIL.

The MIL has demonstrated, on multiple occasions, that she cannot be trusted to respect the parents' boundaries or to shield her granddaughter from traumatic situations. Her actions—from secretly allowing contact with the BIL to exposing the child to a volatile, profanity-laced public argument—are not minor missteps. They are significant breaches of trust that have a direct negative impact on the child, as evidenced by the daughter's physical distress (""making my belly hurt""). The MIL's subsequent deception about the FIL's presence at the mall confirms she is aware of the rules but is willing to manipulate the situation to get her way, rather than rebuild trust honestly.

While the husband's role is problematic, it does not shift the primary judgment. He acts as a conflict multiplier by minimizing his wife's valid concerns, pressuring her to relent without ensuring his parents understand the conditions, and accusing her of ulterior motives. His failure to present a united front with his wife and enforce boundaries with his parents makes the situation more difficult for the author, but it does not make her actions wrong. She is essentially forced to be the sole enforcer of safety rules that both parents should be upholding.

The author's pre-existing dislike for the MIL is relevant context but does not invalidate her current position. Her decision is not based on a vague dislike but on specific, repeated, and harmful actions by the MIL. The author has made",stop,3,11675,1493,14060

Next week I'm going back to London for work without her, which happens...",Other,,,0.8,True,"This situation presents a nuanced conflict between an individual's right to pursue their own happiness and their relational duty to consider the feelings of a loved one, especially when a shared, meaningful experience is involved.

The core of the conflict is not simply about one person wanting to do something and the other not wanting them to. It's about the meaning and context of the shared experience. The initial concert was a Christmas gift from the author to the sister, intended to create a special, shared memory. For the author to almost immediately seek to replicate and ""upgrade"" that experience for themselves (with better, standing tickets) can be reasonably interpreted by the sister as devaluing the original gift and the memory they created together. It changes the narrative from ""we had this amazing, unique experience"" to ""we had a good experience, and now I'm going to have an even better one without you.""

While the sister's inability to articulate the precise reason for her hurt doesn't help, her emotional response is understandable. Feelings of being left out, of the shared memory being tarnished, or of the gift being cheapened are valid emotional grievances in a close sibling relationship. The author's argument that their new experience shouldn't diminish the old one is logical, but it fails to account for the emotional reality of the situation. In relationships, perception and feeling often matter more than pure logic.

The author is not malicious, but they are being insensitive to the context and the emotional impact of their actions. They identified the risk themselves: ""I'm very conscious about kinda poisoning that memory for her."" Proceeding despite this awareness, and prioritizing a second concert over preserving the specialness of a recent, gifted experience with their sister, would be an unkind and self-centered act. The sister's demand might seem unreasonable in a vacuum, but given the context of the gift and the immediacy of the situation, the author bears the primary",stop,3,6074,2409,9102
