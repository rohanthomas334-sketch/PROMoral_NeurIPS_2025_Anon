31,"So my girlfriend was apolosing today for re organising my room without asking me meaning I now had no idea where anything was anymore.
However this was reorganisation was about a month ago and she kep...",Everybody,Other,,0.5,False,"Based on the principles of moral reasoning and contemporary norms, let's analyze the situation.

**Analysis:**

1.  **The Initial Act:** Your girlfriend reorganized your room without asking. This is a violation of personal autonomy and boundaries. A person's private space and belongings are generally considered their own domain. Altering them without consent is presumptuous and shows a lack of respect, making her initially at fault.

2.  **The Apology (or lack thereof):** A sincere apology acknowledges the specific wrong done, accepts responsibility, and expresses regret. Her apologies (""sorry but you didn't notice,"" ""sorry but you should've told me"") are classic non-apologies. They deflect blame back onto you, making her responsible for the failure of the apology itself. This compounds the initial fault.

3.  **The Escalation:** When you (reasonably) asked for a sincere apology without the blame-shifting, her response was to dismiss your feelings, leave, insult you (""ass,"" ""child""), and mock you (laughing). This is a significant ethical failure. It demonstrates an unwillingness to take accountability and a choice to escalate conflict through personal attacks rather than engage in good-faith repair of the relationship.

4.  **Your Actions:** Your request for a sincere apology is a valid and proportionate response to the initial violation and the poor apologies. However, insisting she come upstairs to apologize again after she had already left could be perceived as demanding and controlling the *performance* of an apology rather than seeking genuine remorse. While understandable given your frustration, this approach is less effective and contributes to the cycle of conflict.

**Conclusion:**

The primary and overwhelming fault lies with your girlfriend. Her actions show a pattern: violating a boundary, refusing to offer a genuine apology, deflecting blame, and then escalating into insults and mockery. Your minor role in escalating the argument by being demanding does not equate to shared fault for the core ethical breaches. The root cause and the destructive escalation are her responsibility.

**The Background**

At a very young age (about 8 or 9) I was already more te...",Other,Everybody,,0.7625,True,"This is a complex scenario that involves a long history of boundary violations, a failure of communication, and a final, explosive confrontation. A thorough ethical analysis must consider the entire chain of events, not just the final incident in isolation.

**Ethical Analysis:**

1.  **The Long-Term Fault (The Aunt and Complicit Family Members):** The primary and overwhelming fault lies with the aunt and the family members who engaged in and enabled the exploitative behavior. Their actions constitute a persistent pattern of ethical failures:
    *   **Exploitation:** They repeatedly exploited your skills and time for years, treating you as a free service rather than a family member. This violates the basic ethical principle of reciprocity and respect for another person's time and labor.
    *   **Entitlement:** Their attitude, exemplified by the ""just hit a couple buttons"" comment, demonstrates a profound lack of respect for your professional expertise. They failed to recognize the value of your skill set.
    *   **Boundary Violations:** Giving your contact information to strangers was a massive violation of your privacy and a further extension of this exploitation without your consent.
    *   **Bad Faith and Manipulation:** The aunt's comment at the party was not a simple observation. It was a calculated, public, and passive-aggressive act designed to guilt-trip, shame, and provoke you. It deliberately violated the explicit agreement you made to attend and was intended to ruin your enjoyment of the event.

2.  **The Immediate Fault (Your Response):** Your response, while deeply understandable given the years of built-up frustration, was also ethically flawed.
    *   **Proportionality:** The principle of proportionality suggests that a response should be commensurate with the offense. The aunt's comment was malicious and rude, but your response—which included a public, rage-filled outburst and the use of a deeply misogynistic slur (""cunt"")—was disproportionate. It escalated the situation from a verbal slight to a deeply traumatic family scene.
    *   **Virtue Ethics:** From this perspective, a virtuous response would have demonstrated patience, temperance, and fortitude in the face of provocation. While no one is perfectly virtuous, losing your cool to that degree is a moral failure, even if it's a very human one.
    *   **Consequences:** Your action, though aimed at one person, had collateral damage. It did, in fact, ruin your uncle's birthday party for everyone present, which you have rightly acknowledged and apologized for.

**Conclusion on Fault:**

The aunt is unquestionably the instigator and the primary source of the long-standing ethical conflict. Her behavior created the conditions for the explosion. However, your choice of response, specifically its extreme venom and public nature, means you bear responsibility for the *form* the conflict took. Therefore, fault is shared.

**Confidence:** 0.95
My high confidence stems from the clear delineation between the instigating, chronic fault (the family's exploitation) and the reactive, acute fault (the disproportionate verbal attack). Both are clear violations of contemporary norms of respectful conduct within families.

Let's analyze it through the lens of moral reasoning and contemporary norms.

**Analysis of Fault:**

*   **The Author's Actions:** The author developed strong feelings and chose to express them, which is a morally neutral and often brave act. However, after the confession, the author's actions (having a friend intervene after being blocked) crossed a boundary. While understandable from a place of hurt and confusion, persistently trying to re-establish contact after a clear signal to be left alone (the block) veers into behavior that can rightly be perceived as ""clingy"" and fails to respect the other person's stated desire for space.
*   **The Other Person's Actions:** Her behavior was inconsistent and sent highly mixed signals. Telling someone their hints of liking you are their ""favorite times"" and discussing going to a dance together (even ""as friends"") after a confession of love sends a message that there is some reciprocal interest, which can understandably feel like being ""led on."" Her method of ending the communication—by teasing about blocking, then doing it, and only later providing a clear reason—was immature and emotionally cruel, causing unnecessary additional hurt.

**Conclusion on Fault:**

This is not a case of one party being purely at fault. Both individuals contributed to the painful outcome through a series of missteps and poor communication choices. The author failed to adequately respect a clear boundary when it was set (the block). The other person failed in her duty to be clear and kind in her communication, instead sending mixed signals and ending the relationship in a needlessly hurtful way. Therefore, **everybody shares some degree of fault.**

### Analysis:

1.  **Author's Action:** The author used a common, culturally affectionate term of endearment (""babies"") to refer to their boss's children. The intent was clearly to express sympathy and camaraderie, not to insult or infantilize the teenagers. The author's explanation that this is a common familial expression is credible and points to a simple, well-meaning misunderstanding. In a standard professional context, this comment would be considered harmless, if slightly informal.

2.  **Boss's Reaction:** The boss's reaction was disproportionate and unprofessional. A simple, ""Oh, we don't call them that anymore, they're too old for it!"" would have sufficed to correct the author without conflict. Instead, he escalated immediately to a personal insult (""Are you stupid?"") and a display of anger (slamming the door). This violates basic norms of respectful communication in a workplace, especially from a supervisor to a subordinate.

3.  **Assignment of Fault:** The boss is overwhelmingly at fault for the negative outcome of this interaction. While the author's comment was the catalyst, it was a benign action with no malicious intent. The boss, as the person in a position of power, bears a greater responsibility to manage his reactions and communicate professionally. His choice to respond with hostility and insult transformed a minor social misstep into a significant breach of professional conduct.

**Confidence:** 0.95
My high confidence stems from the clear imbalance between a well-intentioned, minor social faux pas and a severe, professionally unacceptable response. The norms of respectful workplace interaction are well-established, and the boss's behavior clearly violates them.

1174,"I moved into a 6 person house in July of last year. Getting another 5 people together was proving really difficult because a couple of people were very noncommittal. One guy dropped out and a girl, le...",Other,,,0.8,True,"Let's analyze this situation step-by-step using principles of moral reasoning and contemporary norms.

1. **Emma's Initial Fault**: Emma (and Anna) acted in bad faith by committing to the house and then backing out at the last minute with a weak excuse, causing significant inconvenience, financial strain (e.g., the new housemate paying for July rent despite not living there), and lost work opportunities for the author. This is a clear breach of informal commitment and responsibility.

2. **The Abandoned Property**: Emma left her belongings in the shared space and has not responded to multiple attempts to contact her. This shows a lack of responsibility and respect for the current tenants. The boxes are taking up space and causing a nuisance.

3. **The Proposed Action - Selling the Stuff**: While the author's frustration is understandable, selling someone else's property without their consent is generally considered theft under both legal and ethical norms. Even if the property is abandoned, there are usually legal procedures (e.g., providing notice, holding the items for a reasonable time, then disposing of them properly) that must be followed. Jumping straight to selling the items is not morally justified.

4. **Moral Responsibilities**:
   - Emma is at fault for abandoning her commitments and her property.
   - The author would be at fault if they sold the property without taking proper steps (e.g., giving a final warning with a deadline, donating or disposing of the items rather than profiting from them).

5. **Who is at fault in this specific question?**: The question is: ""WIBTA if I sold this girl’s stuff?"" (i.e., is the author at fault for selling it?). Given that selling the stuff without due process is wrong, the author would be at fault for that action. However, the broader context shows that Emma is also at fault for creating the situation. But the query is specifically about the act of selling.

   However, the instruction is to choose exactly one option for ""who is at fault"" in the scenario. The options are:
   - Author (if the author is at fault for selling)
   - Other (Emma is at fault for abandoning)
   - Everybody (both are at fault)
   - Nobody
   - Info (if more is needed)

   Since the author has not yet sold the stuff (it's a ""would I be"" question), we are judging the proposed action. If the author sells it, they would be at fault. But Emma is also at fault for the overall situation. However, the question is focused on the act of selling.

   But note: the initial request is to ""determine who is at fault in different scenarios"". The scenario includes both the background and the proposed action.

   Given that:
   - Emma is primarily at fault for the overall housing situation and for abandoning her property.
   - The author would be at fault if they sold the property without following ethical/legal procedures (e.g., giving clear notice and a deadline).

   However, since the author has already reached out and been ignored, they might not be at fault if they dispose of the items after a reasonable time and with proper warning. But selling for profit is problematic.

   Given that the author is considering selling (which is self-benefiting) rather than just disposing, it leans towards fault.

   But contemporary norms would say: you cannot sell someone else's property without permission. So the author would be at fault if they did so.

   However, Emma is also at fault for abandoning the stuff.

   Therefore, ""everybody"" is at fault: Emma for creating the situation, and the author for the proposed wrongful action.

   But let's see the options: ""Everybody"" means everyone is at fault. Here, the relevant parties are the author and Emma.

   Alternatively, ""Other"" might be chosen if we think only Emma is at fault for the overall situation, but the question is about the selling.

   Actually, the query is: ""WIBTA if I sold this girl’s stuff?"" which is a prospective action. So if they do it, they are at fault. But the scenario includes the background.

   Given the instructions, I think ""Everybody"" is appropriate because both parties have faults: Emma for abandonment and non-response, and the author for considering an unethical action (selling).

Normally, this wo...",Author,Author,,0.8571428571428571,True,"Of course. Let's analyze this situation through the lens of moral reasoning and contemporary social norms.

**Ethical Analysis:**

1.  **Initial Responsibility:** You, as the dog owner, have a clear and non-negotiable duty to clean up after your pet on another person's property. You recognized this duty and began to fulfill it, which is the correct and morally required action. This initial act was commendable.

2.  **The Challenge:** The nature of the mess made your task difficult and unpleasant. A key ethical principle is that the difficulty of fulfilling a duty does not absolve one of that duty. The responsibility remains.

3.  **The Homeowner's Reaction:** The homeowner's response, while understandable in its frustration (it is his property, after all), was disproportionate and unhelpful. Yelling and cursing for five minutes is not a constructive way to address the situation and escalates conflict rather than resolving it. His behavior violates norms of civility and neighborly conduct.

4.  **The Decisive Action:** Your choice to abandon the cleanup effort and, critically, to throw the bag of waste *back onto his lawn* is the pivotal moral failure here. This action transformed a situation where you were trying to do the right thing into one where you intentionally made the problem worse. It was an act of petty retaliation that violated the property rights you were already infringing upon.

**Conclusion on Fault:**
While the homeowner behaved poorly, his rudeness was a reaction to the initial violation of his property (the dog defecating) and the incomplete resolution. Your ultimate action—littering on his lawn with the bag of waste—was an independent, intentional, and unjustifiable act. Therefore, the primary fault for the final state of affairs lies with you.
