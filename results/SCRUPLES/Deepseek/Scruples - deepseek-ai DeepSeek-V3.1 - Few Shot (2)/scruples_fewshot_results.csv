The author is going through a difficult time and opened up to his girlfriend about his struggles. Instead of offering support, she responded with a self-centered ultimatum about her own needs, showing little empathy for his situation. Her response revealed a pattern where she expects the author to prioritize her happiness without reciprocating support during his challenging times.

While the girlfriend's behavior is unsupportive and self-centered, the author is considering breaking up rather than continuing an unbalanced relationship where his needs aren't met. Ending a relationship that isn't working is a reasonable decision, not an asshole move.

The fault lies with the girlfriend for her lack of empathy and support when the author was vulnerable with her.

The author is a 26-year-old woman who has chosen not to have children and does not like being around them. Her parents, in their 50s, have a 7-year-old son (her brother) with special needs who sometimes behaves aggressively. The author feels no obligation to help with childcare, arguing that her parents chose to have a child at an advanced age. She admits to locking her brother in his room when he becomes aggressive because she fears she might physically harm him otherwise.

- The author is at fault for locking a child in a room, which is an inappropriate and potentially harmful way to handle the situation, regardless of her lack of parenting skills or discomfort.
- The parents are at fault for potentially pressuring her to babysit despite knowing her limitations and for not providing adequate care or support for their son, especially given his special needs.
- The child, due to his age and special needs, is not at fault for his behavior.

This is a case where multiple parties share responsibility: the author for her harmful action, and the parents for their poor judgment in expecting her to care for a child she is unequipped to handle.
