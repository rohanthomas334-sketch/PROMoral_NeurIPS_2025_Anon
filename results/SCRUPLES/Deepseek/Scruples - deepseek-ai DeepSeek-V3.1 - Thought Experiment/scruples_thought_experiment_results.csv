The situation involves two main parties: the Other (who engaged in past harmful actions) and the Author (who is considering retaliatory action). The Other is clearly at fault for their initial harmful behavior (name-calling, false accusations, creating a hostile environment). However, the Author is also at fault for planning to escalate the conflict by leaving mean comments on a YouTube channel, which is a disproportionate and harmful response. This creates a cycle of retaliation where both parties share responsibility for the ongoing harm.

The ""Everybody"" category is appropriate because both parties are contributing to the conflict through their actions (past and proposed). The Other's actions are wrong, but the Author's planned retaliation is also ethically culpable. This is not a case where nobody is at fault (harm is occurring), and it is not solely one party's fault (both are involved). Sufficient information is provided to make this judgment without needing additional context.

The interaction is a clear case of mutual escalation where both parties contributed to the conflict. The Author initiated with a critical observation about the friend's eating, and the friend responded with a harsh, generalized judgment. The Author then escalated further with a deeply personal and body-shaming retort. Both individuals failed to communicate respectfully, and each person's actions justified the next misstep in a cycle of provocation and retaliation. While the Author's final comment is the most severe, it was a direct response to the friend's ungracious and judgmental critique.

The analysis indicates that fault depends on the communication and responses that have not yet occurred. Since the scenario is presented as a current state with no action taken or communication initiated, the necessary details about her reasons, her willingness to consider change, and the author's approach to the conversation are missing. Therefore, the classification is ""Info"" because the outcome hinges on these unknown factors.

The reasoning clearly outlines how both parties share responsibility for the communication breakdown and the failure to collaboratively solve a shared problem. The analysis also heavily emphasizes that key unknowns (the wife's medical context, her exploration of alternatives, and the financial details) are crucial for a complete assessment, making ""Info"" a very compelling secondary choice.
