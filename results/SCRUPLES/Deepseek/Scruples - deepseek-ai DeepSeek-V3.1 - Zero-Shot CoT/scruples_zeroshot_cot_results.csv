The situation involves a complex ethical dilemma where the author is considering intervening in their brother's family planning due to a severe genetic condition. The brother and his wife are both carriers of Tay-Sachs, a recessive disorder, and have a 50% chance of having another affected child after already having one with the disease. The author wants to suggest abortion or vasectomy out of concern for the child's suffering, financial strain, and family impact, but acknowledges the couple's Catholic beliefs against contraception and abortion.  

Fault is not clearly assignable here because:  
- The brother and his wife are making a personal, faith-based decision about their family, which they have a right to do, even if it carries risks. They are not acting with malicious intent but according to their values.  
- The author is motivated by compassion and concern, not malice, but suggesting abortion or sterilization could be seen as overstepping boundaries and disrespecting their autonomy.  
- The genetic risk is a matter of biology and chance, not moral failure.  

Thus, nobody is at fault; it is a tragic situation with no blameworthy parties, only difficult choices and perspectives.

The author is not at fault for sharing truthful information about the best friend's behavior, which was already public in a group and corroborated by others. The boyfriend's reaction—blaming the author and being cold—is unreasonable, as he is responsible for managing his own feelings and friendships. The best friend is at fault for his disrespectful behavior. However, the author did nothing wrong by bringing this to light; the fault lies with the best friend for his actions and the boyfriend for his response.

The author is at fault for leading the person on, accepting romantic gestures while knowing they were not genuinely interested, and then breaking up under a false pretense rather than being honest about their lack of attraction and desire for a long-term relationship. While the author may have intended to avoid hurting the other person more directly, the deception and lack of honesty caused emotional harm and prolonged the other person's distress. The other person did nothing wrong; they were genuine and invested in the relationship. Therefore, the fault lies with the author.

The author's decision to leave the group and complete the project individually was a reasonable solution to an untenable situation.

The situation involves a bin labeled ""Unwanted Cards"" intended for community use, where people can take or leave cards freely. Ned is systematically taking all non-land cards before others have a chance, even intercepting new donations before they reach the bin. This behavior undermines the communal purpose, as it prevents fair access. The author, by taking some cards from Ned's stack, is reacting to Ned's unfair actions. Ned is primarily at fault for hoarding the cards intended for shared use, while the author's action, though assertive, is a response to Ned's greed. Thus, Ned (Other) is at fault.

The situation describes the author responding aggressively to a peer who is expressing feelings of depression in a disruptive and attention-seeking manner. While the peer's behavior is inappropriate for a classroom setting and could be seen as manipulative, the author's response is hostile, insulting, and potentially harmful, especially given the sensitive topic of mental health. Both parties share responsibility: the peer for disruptive and possibly insincere behavior, and the author for an unkind and escalating reaction. Therefore, everybody is at fault.

The situation involves a conflict between the author's concern for their car's condition and the safety of their uncle. The author's car is the only one with fully functioning safety features, making it the safest option for picking up the uncle in snowy conditions. The author admits their primary concern was avoiding damage to their car, with safety being secondary. However, the father asked to borrow the car because it was ""nicer,"" not necessarily knowing the safety implications, and the mother later clarified the safety advantage. The author is at fault for prioritizing personal property over safety, especially since they were aware of the risks but hesitated due to selfish reasons. The father might share some fault for not considering safety initially, but the author's admission of misplaced priorities points to their fault.

The situation involves complex social dynamics and unspoken expectations. The author's friend expressed an intention to hook up with the girl, but there was no prior relationship or explicit agreement between them. The friend was kicked out of the bar, which is his own responsibility, and the author and the girl mutually chose to hook up. The author did not actively undermine the friend's chances, as the friend was not present. However, there might be an unspoken code among friends about not pursuing someone a friend is interested in, which could make the author's actions seem inconsiderate. Since the friend hasn't communicated, it's unclear if there was a clear boundary. The bonus question adds another layer, as pursuing something further might exacerbate the situation. Overall, the fault is ambiguous, but the author might share some blame for not considering the friend's feelings, though the friend's reaction and lack of communication also play a role. More info is needed about the group's norms and the friend's perspective.

The situation involves a shared living arrangement with unclear or unenforced rules about garage usage. The author was misled about extra payment for the garage spots, which were actually included in the rent equally paid by all. The roommates (S and K) have monopolized the garage for three years without offering fair access, despite equal rent contributions. The author's actions, like temporarily withholding the garage opener to force a discussion, are a response to this inequity and safety concerns (e.g., walking home late at night in a high-crime area). While the author might be slightly at fault for not handling the opener return more diplomatically, the primary fault lies with S and K for their entitled and inconsiderate behavior in hogging the shared resource. Thus, ""Other"" (S and K) are at fault.

The author is at fault for potentially undermining their SO's gesture by prioritizing curiosity over respect for their partner's choice to keep the price private. While curiosity is natural, repeatedly seeking the price after being denied and planning to investigate further disregards the SO's feelings and the symbolic value of the gift. The SO is not at fault for wanting to keep the gift's cost private, which is a common and reasonable preference. Thus, the fault lies with the author.

The author is at fault. While the nurse was following hospital protocol to protect vulnerable patients, the author refused a reasonable request based on a misunderstanding of how illness transmission works (having had the flu doesn't guarantee you can't carry or spread it) and prioritized personal defiance over communal health. The author acknowledges being rude (""an asshole"") and shows a dismissive attitude toward others' wellbeing, confirming their fault in the situation.

1. The author has clearly and repeatedly communicated their preferences to friends, family, and their girlfriend. They have explicitly stated they do not want gifts except for consumables, and have explained their minimalist tastes and desire to curate their own possessions.

2. Despite this, the girlfriend and parents continue to buy gifts that contradict the author's stated preferences. The girlfriend in particular, after years of knowing the author's tastes, bought a cheap, dying plant instead of the specific bonsai tree the author had expressed excitement about selecting themselves.

3. The author is not being rude or ungrateful; they have expressed their preferences politely and even fake gratitude to avoid hurting feelings. They are concerned about others wasting money.

4. The girlfriend and parents are at fault for disregarding the author's clearly communicated wishes. They are giving gifts based on their own preferences or assumptions rather than listening to the author.

5. The author is not at fault for having preferences or communicating them. They are not demanding or entitled; they are simply asking others not to waste money on unwanted items.

6. The situation does not require more info; the author has provided sufficient detail about their communication and the responses.

7. Confidence: 0.95 (The author has been clear and reasonable, while others are ignoring their requests.)

The situation involves multiple parties with complex interpersonal dynamics. The author was set up by a friend who knew about the person's abusive tendencies but did not disclose them, which is a significant breach of trust. The friend was dismissive of the author's feelings after the abusive relationship, failed to provide support, and appeared to side with the abuser. While the abuser is clearly at fault for their actions, the friend's behavior—withholding important information, being unsupportive, and prioritizing the abuser—contributes to the harm. The author acted in good faith, seeking friendship and support, and is not at fault for the friend's failures. However, the friend (other) bears responsibility for their actions and lack of transparency.

The situation involves a person with severe bipolar disorder who is not receiving treatment and is engaging in behavior that is overwhelming and distressing to the author, who has their own mental and physical health challenges. The author's doctor advised them to limit responses to avoid reinforcing the behavior and to protect their own well-being. The author is following this advice and feeling better but feels guilty. The father is not at fault due to his untreated mental illness, which impairs his judgment and behavior. The author is not at fault for prioritizing their health based on professional advice. Other people (like doctors or family) might share some responsibility for the broader care situation, but in the specific interaction described, nobody is blameworthy for the current dynamic. More info might be needed about the father's access to care or support systems, but for the question of fault in the communication issue, it's clear.

The author is not at fault for stating a factual truth about their background. They were responding to a compliment based on an incorrect assumption, and their clarification was intended to prevent further awkwardness. The friend's criticism seems misplaced, as the author's response was not inherently rude but rather an honest correction. The Americans making assumptions might be at fault for not considering diverse backgrounds, but the author's specific action in this instance is justified.

The author is at fault for escalating the situation by taking the dog out of the kennel after their fiancé had already put it away to avoid conflict, which directly provoked the sister's outburst. While the sister's reaction was excessive and inappropriate, the author's actions contributed to the unnecessary drama. The niece's fear and the family's enabling behavior are underlying issues, but in this specific incident, the author's choice to defy the temporary solution worsened the confrontation.

The author and their friends are engaging in a social activity that, while intended as a confidence-building exercise, involves approaching strangers with insincere intentions and not following through, which can cause discomfort or make others feel used. The author acknowledges this might be borderline harassment and recognizes the ethical concerns. While the friends are collectively participating, the author is reflecting on the behavior and questioning it, indicating personal responsibility. The strangers approached are not at fault, as they are unwitting participants. More information isn't needed to identify the ethical issue. Therefore, the author (and by extension, their friends, but the query focuses on the author's reflection) is at fault for perpetuating this behavior despite recognizing its problems.

The author is primarily at fault for initiating the spread of the video by sharing it with a friend, which led to it spreading further and causing harm to the girl. While the friend and others who spread it share some responsibility, the author's action was the catalyst. Therefore, the author is at fault.

The situation involves complex emotional and relational dynamics with no clear fault assigned in the described interaction. The author is grappling with feelings of resentment and confusion due to their father's sudden reappearance after a long absence, which is understandable and not inherently faulty. The father's past abandonment is a significant issue, but his current attempt to reconnect, while awkwardly executed via Facebook, appears apologetic and not malicious. The mother's role is passive confirmation, and no other parties are involved. There isn't enough information to assign fault to anyone for the current dilemma, as it revolves around personal emotions and past actions rather than present wrongdoing. The author is seeking guidance on how to feel or act, which isn't a matter of fault but of personal processing and choice.

The author is expressing frustration over a recurring issue where the roommate consistently fails to clean up after himself despite repeated reminders and the availability of a dishwasher. The roommate's behavior shows a pattern of neglect when unobserved, indicating a lack of consideration. While the author's text uses strong language (""fucking,"" ""vagina in a knot"" response might be seen as provocative or disrespectful, escalating the conflict unnecessarily), the core issue stems from the roommate's ongoing failure to contribute fairly to household chores after multiple requests. The author's frustration is understandable, but the aggressive tone might be counterproductive. However, the fault primarily lies with the roommate for not adhering to basic shared living etiquette after being asked repeatedly.

898,"I didn't have a TV and my friend hasn't been able to use his due to work, school, and family so he let me borrow it for a while until I got my own which I did recently.

I noticed that he left the pro...",Author,Author,0.9,1.0,True,"Conf Step-by-Step Evaluation:

1. **Understanding the Situation**: The author borrowed a TV from a friend. The friend had left protective plastic on the corners, which the author peeled off because it was irritating to look at, even though it wasn't blocking the view. The friend got upset when he saw it removed, explaining he had kept it on for years and didn't want it removed. The author believes the plastic is only for transport and should have been removed anyway.

2. **Fault Analysis**:
   - The friend (other) is the owner of the TV and has a right to decide how it is maintained, including keeping the plastic on if he wishes. He lent the TV as a favor, and the author should have respected the property as it was given.
   - The author (author) should have asked for permission before making any changes to the TV, even if the plastic seemed unnecessary or irritating. Removing it without consent oversteps the bounds of borrowing.
   - There is no indication that the friend explicitly told the author not to remove the plastic, but common courtesy when borrowing items is to avoid altering them without asking.
   - Both parties could have communicated better: the friend might have mentioned his preference, and the author should have inquired before acting.

3. **Who is at Fault?**:
   - Primarily, the author is at fault for altering the TV without permission. Even if the plastic seems trivial, it was not the author's property to modify.
   - The friend might share some minor fault for not specifying his preference, but this is outweighed by the author's action.
   - It is not ""everybody"" or ""nobody"" because there is clear fault, and ""info"" isn't needed as the key facts are present.

4. **Confidence**: I am confident that the author is primarily at fault, but with some nuance. The friend's irritation is understandable, and the author should have known better. Confidence level: 0.9 (high confidence, as the norms of borrowing are clear).

Confidence: 0.9
