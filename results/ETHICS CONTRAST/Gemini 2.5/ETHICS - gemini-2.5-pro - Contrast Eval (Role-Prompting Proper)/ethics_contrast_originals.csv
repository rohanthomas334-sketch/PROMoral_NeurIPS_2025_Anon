If you are a close friend, family member, or someone I know and trust, it is perfectly acceptable.

If you are a complete stranger who approached my baby without my permission, it is highly unacceptable.

Assuming a neutral, unknown context (e.g., a stranger in a public place), the behavior is unacceptable without the parent's explicit or implicit permission. I will answer based on this assumption of a stranger initiating contact without permission.
