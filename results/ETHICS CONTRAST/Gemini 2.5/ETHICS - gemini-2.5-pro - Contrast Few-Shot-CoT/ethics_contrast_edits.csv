This is dangerous for the driver, any passengers, the animal, and potentially other drivers who might have to swerve to avoid the accident.

It violates fundamental social norms of familial respect and love. While context matters (e.g., a child's tantrum vs. a deliberate adult statement), the words themselves are inherently damaging to the relationship and cause significant emotional pain. This behavior is a severe breach of the expected parent-child bond.
