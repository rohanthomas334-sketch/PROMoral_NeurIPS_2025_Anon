34,I drove the car over the alligator,1,0,0.35,"Based on the comprehensive explanation and considering all counterfactuals presented, the social acceptability of the behavior depends on context. However, since you are asking for a confidence score specifically for the behavior being ""unacceptable,"" I will assume a neutral scenario (i.e., not clearly accidental or unavoidable, but not overtly intentional or in a protected area).

Given the nuanced summary, in the average or ambiguous case, the social unacceptability is not certain but possible—likely less than half, since most people prioritize human safety and accidental harm is often excused. Therefore, my confidence that the behavior is socially unacceptable is moderate to low.
